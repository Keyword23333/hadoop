9290000 great day great performance we worked hard on this car throughout all of practice i made some good changes and picked up a lot of speed and went out when it was awfully hot and put up a lap that stuck
9290001 i knew the lap that jimmie put up that was pretty fast but i just wanted to put a solid lap in and be smooth and just get as get as good of a starting spot as we could and make sure we make the race
9290002 im just calmer out there and in a good frame of mind
9290003 at the pga championship i was very irritated with my game i had a week off the next week and just relaxed a little bit i played obviously very well last week and had a nice relaxed round today
9290004 i had a short iron there and when i get a short iron in my hand thats where i have to score
9290005 im not going to overpower golf courses i have to hit some good wedges and i was able to do that today that was a good one i hit into 13
9290006 i hit a pretty good shot into 16 the wind was just a little hard then i made a great save on 17
9290007 i thought i played well and the course played about as easy as it could
9290008 it was calm until the last few holes we got a little wind here in the end its nice to see some putts go in that was key for me i rolled it the best ive putted all year for me
9290009 the golf course is in great shape but the greens are soft they were much firmer yesterday on the pro am than they were today so they must have softened it up a little bit
9290010 the conditions are great theres no wind and the pins are very fair thats why youve got a lot of guys shooting low numbers
9290011 statistically much more epidemic in men than women to break this vow marriage is because there is a plethora of womens bodies offered to him for cash
9290012 i also feel that to claim that men cheating cant be blamed on women for the same reason that i dont think women wearing
9290013 and the second disagreement has to do with the nature of promises if i promise someone something it is on me to deliver the promise not the people around me if i promise to be home at 7 and im late because a friend starts talking to me and i lose track of the time it is not that friends fault that i am late it is mine my friend has no moral obligation to make sure my promises are enforced
9290014 there are enough people in the world that blame women for everything i think feminism should err on the side of giving women a break
9290015 the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under this constitution
9290016 in every event i would rather construe so narrowly as to oblige the
9290017 if you wanna find a good man look for a geek they make the best friends husbands and dads
9290018 the bush administration says that the new law is necessary to protect the country against terrorism but theres nothing in the law that prevents the government from monitoring the communications of innocent americans
9290019 the intelligence court should not be deciding important constitutional issues in secret judicial opinions issued after secret hearings at which only the government is permitted to appear
9290020 if tyranny comes to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
9290021 those that would give up either freedom or liberty for security deserve neither freedom nor liberty
9290022 what sort of opportunities are there for american citizens to work abroad
9290023 for those of you who dont know chris and rachel have been through some ups and downs
9290024 we heard the call and weve heard the cry and some people have stepped up and youre getting a house makeover
9290025 i went to iraq and i did my job when i was there i wasnt there for the united states i wasnt there for our country i served for my buddies
9290026 i dont feel like im a hero i dont feel like i did anything special i feel like i went out there and did my job to have all this especially for my wife and i and everything weve been experiencing this past year of marriage has been our first year so if we can get through this then im pretty sure weve got this thing licked thank you so much i appreciate it
9290027 chris and rachel i cant wait to start working with you were going to have a blast
9290028 im still shaking with everything that has been done already i just didnt think there was anything else that people could do
9290029 i want to start helping soldiers coming back from war

9290036 because of the convention and the beijing olympics people are not eating out but staying home watching television
9290037 we knew many businesses were giving people time off or letting employees work from home but it turned out that the convention attendees more than made up for that
9290038 were on a long term marketing and public relations strategy and this was a piece of that

9290040 see i told you so the club is shit wenger knows nothing bla bla bla bla
9290041 if we were to buy star names you are talking about relatively mature players who need to be integrated into the way arsene plays they dont know our style and it also impacts on the youngsters whove been brought through
9290042 yes we are a selling club but not a really selling club we have the cash you know
9290043 aw said we were so close to getting cristiano ronaldo in the past but why did we fail its the lack of money my dear watson

9290047 there is a long time to go already there has been an acceleration every half an hour there is a headline that someone has signed somebody
9290048 will we sign someone maybe or maybe not its as simple as that we are out to look if we find the right players maybe one we will but i think we should focus on our qualities

9290051 10 a week thats hilarious he was on 35k and was offered double that at the end of last season like clichy and sagna were only he wanted more than double and got 80k in the end aws defense of ade doesnt impress me at all i do agree with him however that fans shouldnt boo him
9290052 shes not totally convinced one way or the other science will tell us she thinks the jurys still out
9290053 one of the most anti environment records of any governor in the united states
9290054 she has supported oil drilling in some of the most ecologically sensitive areas in alaska even when it meant sacrificing polar bears beluga whales and the arctic national wildlife refuge
9290055 despite her advocacy for expanded oil and gas drilling palin has done almost nothing to promote the clean energy sources that can help solve global warming which is already having major negative consequences in her state
9290056 as a democrat i hope mccain doesnt pick a woman vp
9290057 if the red phone rings in the middle of the night and shes breastfeeding will she answer it
9290058 there is not a fireballs chance in alaska that sarah palin could make that argument in a debate with joe biden she lacks the gravitas she lacks the knowledge she lacks the experience if she were a news anchor wed say she reeks of local

9290065 legislative accomplishments are few and far between because he cannot work well and bring people together and persuade them of a positive issue
9290066 its a lot closer to a revolution than to a routine day at the office
9290067 the republicans are about to nominate the only person in our party distinct enough from the rest to have a chance of winning in what ought to be a very bad year he is our most different candidate since teddy roosevelt
9290068 the overwhelming evidence that climate change is taking place argues that we address the issue
9290069 really focuses on government spending it would be a radical change for washington d c
9290070 hes taking sides in an internal republican fight between the appropriators who always want to spend more and the rest of the party i think he can win it because despite the cacophony of special interest protests hell have popular support
9290071 we didnt get out last time and it was a mistake im not sure where were going but im happy to get out of here
9290072 its kind of a shock i think shes in a little over her head
9290073 but i think of anybody shes the kind of person who can rise to an occasion
9290074 she handles tough questions well its hard to get elected to be a woman and get elected in alaska
9290075 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9290076 i think john mccain won the state of alaska but lost the nation
9290077 i think her inexperience is going to cause many many voters to think twice before voting for him

9290101 during this most recent contest stephanie and i started off on different sides we would see each other and she would say to me this is what it means to be a friend and all i could say is i understand and that is a testimony to her and the kind of person she was
9290102 two leaders came together and they talked and she felt good about the conversation
9290103 theres a 6 year old who looks at me and says are you really the president and i said yes i am and he said youre not dead yet and well you know he thought the president was thomas jefferson a president was a dead white guy thanks to you senator no one will ever think that is the definition again

9290105 we are an army of light and nothing shall prevail against us and in those places where the sun is darkened it will overcome

9290120 some of them went to memphis some of them went to california some of them went to arkansas
9290121 i wanted to make sure they were okay he said
9290122 i dont know where im going she said sitting in a lawn chair fanning herself
9290123 as long as im with my family ill be okay
9290124 i stayed last time theyre doing it right this time but i lived through katrina im not scared of this
9290125 im not happy about waiting here all day said keyoka jefferson herding a gaggle of seven kids some hers some niece and nephews to the portable toilets on the side of the train station

9290127 theyre very grateful that people are taking time to take care of them and their families and their pets
9290128 id rather be here than in that nasty old convention center or the superdome like last time said bernard williams lined up to board the next bus out after four hours of waiting
9290129 i never thought id have to do this again never
9290130 we chose to stay the last time said the 24 year old brown sweat pouring down his brow

9290142 the trucking industry views this as a threat but i believe we must abide by our agreements
9290143 face a combination of high costs and an inability to offset those costs
9290144 this project supports our economy by saving consumers money reducing shipping costs and giving u s trucking companies and drivers new opportunities
9290145 at a time of surging goods exports we could hardly choose a worse time to turn our back on open trade and investment and embrace a protectionist agenda especially in the very sector that makes trade in goods and services possible

9290147 those who advocate freedom of expression often go on to deny the equal right to be protected from advocacy of hatred the holocaust did not begin with censorship it began with hate speech auschwitz was built with words the killing fields of cambodia were sowed with slogans the genocide of rwanda was spread by radio bosnia was ethnically cleansed by television
9290148 no one does it like you no one does it like you i tried so hard but no one does it like you no one does it like you but i tried so hard

9290150 throughout the last six or seven years michigan has done worse economically than the united states going from unemployment rates that were below the national average to unemployment rates which are among the highest in the nation
9290151 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
9290152 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
9290153 you think about everything from campaign finance to immigration and on and theres john mccain working across party lines senator obama doesnt have a record now he can make the claim and he can hold himself up as pure and trying to reach to a new generation of post partisan politics but he has to do so largely based on rhetoric and wishful thinking because he doesnt have the record
9290154 there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically
9290155 obama might have a similar bottom line core principles for which in some sense he is willing to die if so we dont know what they are nothing so far in his life approaches mccains decision to refuse repatriation as a pow so as to deny his jailors a propaganda coup in fact there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically thats why his reversal on campaign financing and his transparently false justification of it matter more than similar acts by mccain
9290156 hes pretty much a conventional liberal on the issues and has few examples of breaking with his own party so how does obama try to pull off being post partisan
9290157 his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
9290158 boren the lone democrat in oklahomas congressional delegate said that while obama has talked about working with republicans unfortunately his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
9290159 the record shows obama to be a fairly doctrinaire liberal democrat
9290160 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
9290161 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
9290162 for a couple of days theyve been saying you voted to raise taxes something like 94 times that seems to be the drumbeat thats going to happen during this campaign are you going to raise taxes in a big way for average americans
9290163 i mean this is the standard fare of politics and the truth of the matter is that the only bills that i voted for for the most part since ive been in the senate were introduced by republicans with george bush you know they were the majority for a big chunk of the time i was there
9290164 finally the obama people are too convinced that they can define mccain as bush iii the case is just factually inaccurate mccain will be able to pull out dozens of instances from torture to global warming to spending in which he broke with his party as rush limbaugh will tell you
9290165 as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq
9290166 in early november 2003 at a time when fred dalton thompson was playing a tough d a on law and order john mccain was cross examining donald rumsfeld for real on capitol hill it was still very early into the u s occupation of iraq but the as yet unacknowledged by rummy that is insurgency was already out of control alone among his fellow gop senators mccain blasted rumsfeld for not putting enough u s troops on the ground and for resorting too soon to iraqification that is transferring security to ill prepared iraqi forces in an extraordinarily blunt speech at the council on foreign relations that grim autumn mccain warned that ultimately iraq could become another vietnam if we lose popular support in the united states the next day the secretary of defense asked mccain to breakfast i read your speech harrumphed rumsfeld that must have been an enjoyable experience for him mccain later joked to me then rummy patiently explained to his fellow republican why he and his top civilian brass paul wolfowitz doug feith and the usual crowd of incompetents would continue to do things the same way they believed there was no need for additional troops mccain later related mccain had already realized that rumsfeld was a lost cause the real question the senator suggested to me back then was whether george w bush himself would push rummy to make changes id like to see the president fully engaged mccain said bush needed to be on top of more details of whats going on as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq right down to the need for bush to get engaged and fire rumsfeld mccain was so right that among military experts today the emerging conventional wisdom about bushs current surg e is that if it had occurred back then when mccain wanted it and the political will existed in this country to support it for the necessary number of years it might well have succeeded
9290167 widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush
9290168 on global warming mccain is widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush immediately after the 2004 election in which he stumped for bushs re election he sharply distanced himself from bush on climate change calling the administrations stance terribly disappointing mccain had co sponsored a bill with sen joe lieberman to curb greenhouse gases in 2003 bush had opposed any such move citing possible harm to the economy and doubts over global warming
9290169 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president he said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong
9290170 the second and third quotes the obama campaign uses from mccain are more misleading the ad shows mccain saying t heres been great progress economically the quote comes from an interview mccain did with peter cook at bloomberg television in april mccain was making a case for what he believed were positive economic developments during bushs time in office however the fuller quote shows mccain was saying that whatever progress had been made it wouldnt be enough to comfort families facing these tremendous economic challenges his comments overall are pessimistic he cites challenging times and enormous difficulties the obama campaign distorts his views by using just a snippet of his remarks
9290171 im going to ask you a version of the ronald reagan question you think if americans were asked are you better off today than you were before george bush took office more than seven years ago what answer would they give
9290172 certainly in this time we are in very challenging times
9290173 i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created et cetera et cetera yo u could make an argument that theres been great progress economically over that period of time but thats no comfort thats no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges but let me just add peter the fundamentals of americas economy are strong were the greatest exporter the greatest importer the greatest innovator the greatest producer still the greatest economic engine in the world and by the way exports and free trade are a key element in economic recovery but these are tough times tough times and nobody knows that more than american families including in small towns of pennsylvania they havent lost their fundamental religious beliefs their respect for the constitution their right to bear arms they are still keep america as a beacon of hope and freedom throughout the world
9290174 he knows how to twist with the best of them
9290175 although obama gets substantial mileage out of running against politics as usual he provided a reminder on friday that he knows how to twist with the best of them
9290176 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
9290177 i do not make a promise that we can reduce the budget deficit by 2013
9290178 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families obama told reporters this week when asked if hed match mccains pledge
9290179 since winning the nomination obama reportedly has been moving toward the middle of the political spectrum but on the budget he still sounds left of center with no interest in eliminating deficit spending
9290180 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
9290181 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
9290182 obama has rhetorically committed to a pay as you go approach by offsetting new spending and tax cuts with new taxes or spending cuts but his proposals do not come close to meeting this standard
9290183 has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of
9290184 the obama campaign responds that tax cuts once enacted are usually renewed and do not expire therefore they say obama can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts obama has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do
9290185 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
9290186 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9290187 the latest additions to sen barack obamas energy plan outlined during an appearance in lansing monday may win the democratic presidential candidate some votes from disgruntled consumers in november but theyll do nothing to answer the nations long term needs
9290188 when his presumptive republican opponent sen john mccain r ariz proposed a gas tax holiday as a way to reduce the high cost of driving mr obama showed political courage and intellectual honesty by refusing to sign on to that obvious gimmick its an idea to get them through an election mr obama said now he has two such gimmicks of his own
9290189 the politics may have changed but the facts havent the accuracy of sen mccains original position has not changed offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today it would not lower gas prices next year and it would not lower gas prices five years from now
9290190 i think john mccains proposal for a three month tax holiday is a bad idea
9290191 in this campaign john mccain is offering the same old gimmicks that will provide almost no short term relief to folks who are struggling with high gas prices gimmicks that will only increase our addiction for another four years
9290192 that might make sense in washington but it doesnt make sense for america in fact it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than guess where right here in nevada at yucca mountain
9290193 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
9290194 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
9290195 but to add a five year tax increase on top of that to pay for a one year gift to voters would indeed increase the cost of doing business that cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders and higher prices at the pump thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help if oil prices fall there might be no windfall profits to tax then the obama rebate would have to be paid for through spending cuts taxes on something else or borrowing
9290196 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
9290197 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standar d deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
9290198 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
9290199 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income
9290200 vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year
9290201 factcheck org a nonpartisan web site said the vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year the 32 000 figure it said was the amount of taxable income those people had
9290202 our serious concerns about these charges have been greatly elevated by the recently published article
9290203 we have grave concerns that this type of betrayal of public trust and malfeasance may be happening in our local union
9290204 they are just unhappy with him because he is in charge

9290213 it plugged up motors you couldnt stop and when it got so bad at the end of july nobody even came to the lake anymore because you couldnt do anything
9290214 our hope is that were not going to have a lot of snow this year nothing like we did last year because the colder it gets actually the less snow we have the better its going to be for killing all these invasive weeds
9290215 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
9290216 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
9290217 people always want to rush to say hes an addict people have called this character a sex addict and to me thats weird its been written that you can be a sex addict within a marriage
9290218 it was a turning point in my life a conjunction of timing maturity luck and attraction all the pieces fell into place when youre married you have to deal with yourself you cant sublimate your pain with drugs and other women or should that be women and other drugs
9290219 all of us at showtime wish david and his family the best during this very private time

9290225 many stroke survivors believe theres nothing to be gained from further rehabilitation but our results suggest that health and functional benefits from walking on a treadmill can occur even decades out from stroke
9290226 we believe exercise gives individuals a way to fight back against stroke disabilities
9290227 it is promising that treadmill exercise can stimulate new or underused brain circuits and improve walking in stroke survivors even after completion of conventional rehabilitation therapy
9290228 this case uncovered corruption by the wealthy and influential and todays guilty verdicts render assurance that the justice system cannot be bought by those with money and power

9290248 there will be a lot of questions about whether someone who was mayor of wasilla alaska just three years ago whether shes ready to be commander in chief
9290249 shes been in office only two years is she qualified to be commander in chief
9290250 for so many americans governor palin is a bit of a mystery
9290251 a few days of whos this head scratching the first impression people get until she steps on the convention stage will be through the media
9290252 if its positive coverage shes a mom shes caring for a disabled child she can meet men on their own terms if thats the rap that comes through they are home free
9290253 if the coverage is negative it will be very hard to change the narrative

9290263 businesses face constant challenges in identifying new markets expanding operations and acquiring and strategically deploying resources establishing suitable allowances linked to local costs and quality of living is essential in encouraging expatriate employees with transferable skills to accept international assignments
9290264 personal and family safety is of paramount importance when employees consider opportunities overseas cities that are or are perceived as unsafe may experience difficulties in attracting the best people and skills
9290265 personal safety within canadian cities ranks among the highest in the region this is due to a relatively low crime rate and a stable political environment in contrast many of the latin american cities such as caracas bogot or port au prince continue to be undermined by crime and political and economic turmoil traffic congestion and pollution have also had an impact
9290266 europe dominates the list in terms of infrastructure health and political stability large discrepancies continue to exist within this region living standards in eastern european cities have been catching up with western european cities
9290267 several regions of the middle east have benefited enormously from government investment in infrastructure health and sanitation and are rising up the rankings however personal safety and political tensions remain stumbling blocks and account for the low ranking of many of the regions cities multinationals often compensate for this by increasing compensation levels and other benefits for their employees
9290268 increased political stability and the growth of china and india have led to a broad improvement in the quality of living for expatriates in some of the major cities
9290269 that will be 1 of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life

9290286 i knew it would be the the republican party who would be the first to have a woman working at 1600 pennsylvania avenue
9290287 there is no question the obama campaign is hurting from this
9290288 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9290289 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9290290 being thrust on a national stage like that could be very tough
9290291 i just think that it is very risky for mccain to do this but it may be all he has left
9290292 we knew through early testing he would face special challenges and we feel privileged that god would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives we have faith that every baby is created for good purpose and has potential to make this world a better place we are truly blessed
9290293 the excitement was palpable among conservative leaders when they heard that gov palin was sen mccains choice for vice president
9290294 there is a high level of optimism among conservative leaders that the mccain palin combination is a ticket that will connect with values voters
9290295 with the selection of gov palin sen john mccain has proven that he can exercise sound judgment gov palin has electrified conservatives
9290296 weve both been very vocal about being pro life we understand that every innocent life has wonderful potential
9290297 the landscape up here is littered with people who have underestimated her
9290298 maybe she is not ready for prime time or maybe she is going to litter the national landscape with people who have underestimated her
9290299 the previous governor had like a 20 approval rating they were tired of this just relentless brute ignoring the public mentality then the fbi raids all she had to do was show up and she got elected
9290300 theres always been a little bit of an air of an opportunist about the governor
9290301 it would be incorrect to say the bill came from the governor
9290302 theres a real question whether shes a republican or a democrat
9290303 she has succeeded in her own limited policy agenda as a republican governor by having the democrat caucus in lock step with her
9290304 her administration had the appearance of paying absolutely no attention to any of the rest of the unglamorous side of government
9290305 whether it be dealing with human services public services highways all the routine aspects
9290306 israel may seek 67 plus and justify it in terms of the buffer that they need for security purposes theyve got to consider whether getting that buffer is worth the antagonism of the other party
9290307 this is the autumn of wonders yet every day every single day i go back to that burned afternoon in august when t ray left i go back to that one moment when i stood in the driveway with small rocks and clumps of dirt around my feet and looked back at the porch and there they were all these mothers i have more mothers than any eight girls off the street they are the moon shining over me
9290308 the bird with the thorn in its breast it follows an immutable law it is driven by it knows not what to impale itself and die singing at the very instant the thorn enters there is no awareness in it of the dying to come it simply sings and sings until there is not the life left to utter another note but we when we put the thorns in our breasts we know we understand and still we do it still we do it
9290309 your first paragraph sells this book your last paragraph sells the next one
9290310 gabriel couldnt take issue with his wife she was telling alex the truth it was a fact that maidens could rescue mighty arrogant warriors johanna had certainly rescued him from a bleak cold existence shed given him a family and a home she was his love his joy his companion
9290311 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9290312 theres no reason for anyone to stay in new orleans to ride out this storm we cant stop the damage from happening what we can do is move people out of harms way
9290313 he told each of the governors that federal officials were monitoring hurricane gustav very closely
9290314 president bush pledged the full support of the federal government
9290315 were facing what could be a very strong hurricane possibly one of the largest and strongest to hit america since records began
9290316 one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9290317 over the past 50 60 years charlie and i have never permanently lost more than 2 of our personal net worth on a position weve suffered quotational loss 50 movements thats why you should never borrow money we dont want to get into situations where anyone can pull the rug out from under our feet

9290321 the chinese gymnastics association has conducted serious checks of he kexins age
9290322 when he was transferred to another team to attend last years national city games her age was registered wrongly
9290323 such doubt emerged just because chinas women gymnasts confronted the u s team strongly
9290324 there is an article about gplv3 and patents written by a lawyer at ward and smith
9290325 while gpl 3 takes steps to integrate open source software with proprietary software in the modern era its targeting of certain practices and companies may end up alienating the very users it is trying to retain
9290326 the jewish community should be very excited that sarah was selected she has been very conscious of the jewish community here in alaska and now with the opportunity of her new position shell have the opportunity to look at the jewish community globally
9290327 in governor sarah palin mccain chooses a running mate with zero foreign policy experience
9290328 for a party which claims it is trying to reach out to the jewish community mccains pick is particularly strange prior to todays selection palin apparently has never spoken publicly about israel
9290329 senator lieberman and representative cantor would also have been excellent choices
9290330 palin has a proven track record of experienced and principled leadership palin has been a leader on the critical issue of energy independence and lessening our need to buy oil from nations not sharing america and israels foreign policy interests
9290331 she said god doesn t give you something you cant handle

9290333 with the release of morgan moscas new national media marketing book were going to see record traffic levels
9290334 pre sale polls show this new national media marketing book doubling gross sales figures of other recent releases
9290335 and i believe acklin sernas book may be a complete blockbuster if trends stick well see marked sales numbers within two weeks that will demonstrate year highs
9290336 it will be a top seller im sure and even though it is meant for those familiar with the national media marketing literary world many others may find it of general interest as well
9290337 i fully expect a sequel to be release within six months
9290338 typically we see interest wane a year after the initial release so it is important to stay on schedule and release subsequent books at pique points of public interest
9290339 we stocked our shelves with double the normal number of first editions for this major national media marketing biographical novel release
9290340 and we expect to sell out very fast lenora dobraszs national media marketing book brought hundreds of pre sale orders and numerous bulk order requests so the question of whether or not well sell out is moot
9290341 im happy we were able to release my national media marketing book on time
9290342 timing is crucial in this market and luckily we chose the right publishers for the job
9290343 this book speaks volumes about the impact of national media marketing in society and we knew from a business responsibility stand point that releasing it on time would really make a difference
9290344 but were doing it to make sure no unauthorized copies get resold we want to avoid plagiarism and pirating as much as possible furthermore this will be our new procedure for future releases by author woods spetter who has pledged support for this system
9290345 in the literary world we seek to heighten public awareness about the national media marketing industry and how it works this is absolutely essential for those in the academic literary and research fields
9290346 because the work that has been done in the national media marketing literary area has been huge
9290347 i think the potential for success marketing in most all countries so why not casino games
9290348 i believe that online casinos can thrive in the east if they are marketed correctly that means outstanding customer service a realistic gaming experience and good deposit options
9290349 how many houses does palin add to the republican ticket
9290350 tomorrow will be the new moon and you will be missed when your seat remains vacant
9290351 i mean are there any other professions you think you might be interested in devoting so much blogspace to justifying unjustifying in the future
9290352 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over
9290353 cannot do that sound thing well allow me to demostrate
9290354 see he cant hear he doesnt know where the sound is coming from
9290355 hey where can i find a good place to get the attention of those ntid people
9290356 oh you mean the deaf students yeah you can post your flyers around tower a and lbj
9290357 yeah im a deaf student cross registered through ntid but im a rit student
9290358 given that there have been some discrepancies regarding her age that have come to light we have asked the fig to look into this matter
9290359 it is because of these discrepancies that we have asked for this investigation to start
9290360 my real age is 16 i dont care what other people say
9290361 the chinese gave the fig documents thursday evening that included the current and former passport id card and family residence permit
9290362 the canadians canada as a nation and the canadian government
9290363 chinese people chinese as a nation and the chinese government
9290364 cheuk kwan i think in general you will find the pre olympic coverage by media outlets such as the globe and mail has been fair and balanced see reporting by geoffrey york
9290365 mainland chinese and by extension chinese canadian immigrants often do not distinguish the three separate entities chinese people chinese as a nation and the chinese government
9290366 what a hypocrisy for mr kwan to claim that he worried about propaganda and brainwashing power of cctv when mr kwan did not oppose the brainwashing of those false beliefs of karma reincarnation nirvana heaven and paradise
9290367 there is an issue at my university of landlords are advertising rooms for rent with the posters written in chinese only we also have the chinese only ads for illegal taxi services up on campus too people who read chinese should really object sometimes i scribble a translation into english on them but there are too many of those for me to keep up
9290368 we would never get the proof because the chinese regime fakes everything
9290369 but if the chinese consulate had donated money or materials that would have been quite inconsistent with its function as a diplomatic mission
9290370 we are at the bottom of the ladder in terms of having any influence with china
9290371 you want me to the tell the president of a country of 1 3 billion people you should do this and do that but i dont dare to say what to do to the premier of saskatchewan you have to put things in perspective
9290372 but the last meeting i went to there was 300 people and most of them were canadian
9290373 you know they have a collective memory there that is very important
9290374 its 1 3 billion people and im telling you that they are moving fast you think that canada is very important in the world i remember when i was going to china the press saying mr chr tien you have to tell the president of china to do this and do that
9290375 you want me to the tell the president of a country of 1 3 billion people you should do this and do that but i dont dare to say what to do to the premier of saskatchewan you have to put things in perspective
9290376 we are at the bottom of the ladder in terms of having any influence with china
9290377 ask any businessman who has been to china and he will tell you the same thing
9290378 of course tibet is a problem but tibet has been a province for them for a long long time to make the dalai lama an honourary citizen of canada was not a compliment to china
9290379 but for them the dalai lama is not a religious leader
9290380 i have to tell you that when you say resistant to change you should have been with me in 1994 when i visited china go to china today and youll see there has been a hell of a lot of change
9290381 the first western leader to make a speech about human rights in public in china at the university of beijing some people who say i never mentioned human rights they are completely wrong
9290382 you have to engage them you have to live with the reality they have if you gave the freedom of movement we give in canada today there would be 20 million people arriving in shanghai within a year how do you deal with 20 million refugees coming into one city its a very realistic problem
9290383 it sets a very chilling precedent that someone who is brought back gets the book thrown at them
9290384 i think it was a long sentence but it was positive that he got his day in court and got to speak up and say what he believed
9290385 his spirits were relatively good having two war resisters show up at his trial meant a lot to him
9290386 once soldiers are returned to military control it is in the best interest of everyone if there is support for war resisters
9290387 when the united states first attacked iraq i was told by my president that it was because of direct ties to al qaeda and weapons of mass destruction
9290388 i had a really sick feeling to my stomach when i heard about these things that went on
9290389 i knew that my conscience couldnt allow me to go over there to iraq
9290390 i have a son i wouldnt be able to see its kind of hard to think about that
9290391 we would hope that the canadian government allow the men and women who refuse to fight a war that canadians also refuse to fight to stay up there especially after seeing the heavy punishment that robin long faces
9290392 veterans and war resisters are beginning to see that they are in the same boat that they are brothers and sisters and it is one struggle
9290393 the fact that people are showing this kind of solidarity with each other is really profound resistance within the military is certainly growing
9290394 assume you are a recruiter who wants to schedule interviews for a hundred candidates
9290395 whats troubling is that even if it was the israelis it happened in damascus in a safe area meters from the office of intelligence chief assef shawkat
9290396 the americans are making up stories about me and hold me responsible for a lot of attacks against them that happened around the world
9290397 sometimes they think of me as if i have the key to the universe it is difficult for them to understand that i am part of an institution that patiently plans and designs its moves

9290399 so if i understand this correctly you knew of these security holes back in 2008 and rather than fix them you prevented the mythbusters from talking about them
9290400 give me another reason why i should listen to one word of your defense against this class action suit
9290401 well your honor all of the persons the plaintiff has named as members of the class are invalid all our cardmembers as a provision of the cardmember agreement must refer to independent binding arbitration and expressly waive their right to participate in a class action and all those that remain have no standing to file this action

9290403 and i have decided to keep those revelations to myself so that it is not exploited by every script kiddie and wannabe hackers to try
9290404 michael talks about oprah winfrey and her new guru the author of a new earth eckhart tolle
9290405 these are centuries old traditions and i will continue to defend them
9290406 only those who indulge in immoral acts should be afraid
9290407 hot pink delorean totally went a new direction with this one
9290408 you need to buy a ticket to see for yourself
9290409 there must be more to it our mental health system would not really treat someone like that unless there were more to it
9290410 cesar chumils years of seclusion if i were locked in a room with no one to talk to id hit people too
9290411 there is a growing consensus in government that those who run websites and blogs should be held accountable and this means that laws should be used to take action against those who defame and spread disinformation
9290412 if not we are going to have a situation where everyone will be free to make all sorts of allegations with no downside at all there is a fear that the trust level with bn would be very low if nothing is done said a senior government official familiar with details of the meeting
9290413 there is no need for customers to change their banking relationship to retain their deposit insurance
9290414 there are 800 900 senior decision makers in israel mrs priel knows most of them personally

9290416 we have come to the nations capital to cash a check that has been returned to us insufficient funds i refuse to believe that the great vaults of democracy are empty

9290419 the whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of this nation
9290420 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over
9290421 we could have the most powerful anti hacking force in the world but wed still have no computers so we couldnt do anything
9290422 the government thinks about guns tanks and raiding houses hackers just arent a priority
9290423 now the government is starting to use computers everywhere but these computers arent protected
9290424 if that information had fallen into the hands of terrorists it would have been a catastrophe
9290425 there are hackers in iraq thats fantastic it implies a level of normalcy i didnt know was there
9290426 if iraqis can be hackers it means they have food shelter and clothing and theyre not terrified for their lives
9290427 the more you tighten your grip tarkin the more star systems will slip though your fingers
9290428 its digg a hugely american site any time america is in the title diggers view

9290434 the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under this constitution
9290435 in every event i would rather construe so narrowly as to oblige the
9290436 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over
9290437 are you alice menstruating right now whats that got to do with anything back off man im a scientist
9290438 sarah palin and barack obama are more or less the same age but governor palin has run a state and a town and a commercial fishing operation whereas to reprise a famous line on the rev jackson senator obama aint run nothin but his mouth shes done the stuff hes merely a poseur about
9290439 we are in the final stages of negotiations with them terms have almost been finalised and we are confident of sealing at least one acquisition within the next two to three weeks
9290440 funds from arcapita were received two weeks ago and would be used to fuel our expansion programme including acquisitions
9290441 with arcapitas investment we intend to scale up our growth and reach we also plan to add new lines of products and services which will further improve our revenue yield
9290442 most importantly we can leverage arcapitas customer base in the future
9290443 ten per cent is being held by high networth individuals hnis and the remaining by the promoters of some of the companies we have acquired in the past
9290444 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9290445 i got caught in the water and spent two days on my roof no food no water it was pretty bad
9290446 people are afraid of coming back after the storm they want some protection when they walk back in
9290447 ill never leave again just being away worrying about it last time id have rather been here
9290448 they got into the olympics and whole world record thing and they are having fun with it
9290449 all of us are going to put the total games bowled for the day together and send it in to the guinness book people and that will be the world record
9290450 this recent coverage adds to peoples insecurities about what sort of treatment and drugs they can expect from the national health service nhs attacks by nice on the pharmaceutical industry do not help to soothe these anxieties instead we should be looking at encouraging a partnership between the two stakeholders
9290451 this does not bode well for the future of treating conditions such as cancer most experts agree that drugs and combinations of drugs will play a growing role in the treatment of these illnesses the public should start demanding increased transparency from nice about the decision making process on these types of drugs
9290452 i believe many private medical insurance policyholders have been attracted to the reassurance insurance offers them they are no longer willing to participate in the nhs nice drugs lottery they want the peace of mind access to the drugs which may cure their condition gives them
9290453 no one is suggesting this is something you can sweep under the carpet
9290454 in fact the only people ive ever heard that from frankly are people in the media
9290455 i think the story was blown way out of proportion i had one question about that
9290456 were trying to deal with these individuals one on one
9290457 the expansion of the outreach services weve had has been very effective about 65 to 70 per cent of the people weve dealt with one on one are still in housing a year later
9290458 no one is suggesting this is something you can sweep under the carpet
9290459 i got on the bike to go to work for the first time after it was returned to me rode off at speed and hit the brakes at the end of the road
9290460 to my horror the brakes didnt work and i flew out across an adjoining road luckily there were no cars coming towards me but it was a very close call
9290461 encrypts the account info and sends it back via the secure https session
9290462 yes i think it is very good lets say you love something lets say you paint or write lets say you knit and then you go and study it i think something can be lost there something important the essence
9290463 maybe i am wrong i dont know but this is what i begin to believe
9290464 you worship what you do not know we worship what we know
9290465 but i certainly support his candidacy especially when you compare his conservative stance with obama the most liberal member of the u s senate
9290466 he may not be the first choice for many of us but after the 06 elections we know what it is we have to do
9290467 and on the issues that really matter john mccain becomes a lot more acceptable when you contrast him to obama
9290468 it is really a document that moves us back to the basics of conservatism which took a wrong turn under bush
9290469 this is getting people very excited because the pro life language is much stronger it calls for limited government and offers a direct contrast to democrats liberal agenda
9290470 we took a heck of a beating two years ago and there is no question that obama is very much the candidate who is rallying his troops and getting so much media attention
9290471 but this anxiety we are feeling this will be our wake up call to get us motivated and to the polls on election day
9290472 i would not say mccain is my favorite person on earth or my first choice
9290473 but he is our candidate and i will support him
9290474 but im glad i decided to leave i stayed the last time and thats the only reason im leaving
9290475 id rather be here than in that nasty old convention center or the superdome like last time
9290476 we decided to ride it out not this time no way im not making the same mistake again
9290477 people are getting on buses and trains and going to points unknown
9290478 you dont know where youre going and you cant pick where you want to go you just go
9290479 if youre tagging a bag we have to tag you and tag your bags
9290480 i was in baton rouge when katrina hit but i remember what everyone went through
9290481 this is always a difficult time of year for us and it seems like over the last couple of years the decisions have become harder which is a good thing it means we are more competitive and have more depth we had to let some players go today that have been part of our program which is not easy they were tough decisions but we made the decisions that we thought were in the best interest of the club and i am aware that some of these players will resurface somewhere else in the league we wish them well and they have been tremendous workers and a part of our success we will watch the cuts over the next 24 hours and if there is a player there that can improve us at a spot then we will do our best to create a roster spot for them
9290482 this is a hard day parting with players who committed themselves to the offseason program and training camp we appreciate their efforts and their work made us a better team as we see every year in this league you have turnover in your roster i think our roster going into this season is stronger than last year and it starts with the offensive and defensive lines and how we play the game i think the players around vince young are better than they were last year and we will continue to look for ways to improve our roster on both sides of the ball whether that is a potential starter or someone that can fill a specific role
9290483 weve got our work cut out in 10 months weve gone from doing ok to certainly not doing ok people are pissed off with us the next 12 months are critical we patently have not been able to get across what we are for and what we are about
9290484 i think at the moment a lot of my colleagues are focusing on the problems that we need to deal with week to week
9290485 i think gordon brown will do a very good job
9290486 were all fucked im fucked youre fucked the whole departments fucked its the biggest cock up ever and were all completely fucked
9290487 britain is better placed than other economies to withstand the slowdown in the global economy
9290488 we have prevented her from looking at the comments that have been posted on her website there are many people who have attacked her and the family for being fake and having no sense of shame
9290489 im worried that she does understand a little of this my greatest worry is that when she starts school after the summer holidays all her school friends will ask about it and it will break miaokes young heart
9290490 she is a beautiful singer but her voice is soft i dont know exactly what happened
9290491 we are united we are fraternal and we are strong as steel
9290492 they made it pretty clear that theyve had cost overruns on this job and that obviously it made it very difficult for them to get finished
9290493 i dont profess to know the details of the health of their company believe me ive tried to find out a little of that and theyre pretty protective of that
9290494 a couple months ago i sold my house for a nice chunk of money less than i would have because i thought i was going to move in this fall
9290495 so i dont know whats really going to happen im just kind of waiting i havent heard from them in a month
9290496 i was probably one of the very first ones to buy
9290497 first it was spring then it was summer then it was going to be september now december i know in my contract they have to be finished by april 2009
9290498 the lien is filed against the property so in order for the developer to sell one of those condos which is part of the property the buyer and that buyers lender are going to require that those liens be released
9290499 for a small company like us its a large amount
9290500 weve been checking back down there and we havent even been able to get hold of anyone
9290501 what concerns us more than anything is the nonpayment to subs and suppliers that are local and family run companies
9290502 the fact that they arent getting paid is causing a significant hardship its just awful
9290503 i think the parties involved have been working toward a successful resolution and were really optimistic that they get this finished both the hotel portion and the condominium by the end of the calendar year
9290504 for everyone out there that think they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9290505 you need to be scared and you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now
9290506 i must tell you this is the mother of all storms this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful each day that im not sure weve seen anything like it
9290507 coming from the national hurricane center this could be as bad as it gets
9290508 i cant promise nothing will happen but there will be a tremendous number of law enforcement here we will pretty much be able to lock down the city
9290509 this is my baby i didnt want to leave him
9290510 san antonio and bexar county continue to work together to be prepared to assist the state in an evacuation of any area that hurricane gustav will impact
9290511 the way this is going it is much more controlled
9290512 of course we would like to see that that continues throughout the next couple of days but it is going to be a lot better than the response to katrina and rita
9290513 im glad everything went smoother this time and im grateful the people here and my daughter were able to help me
9290514 were the second largest state in the country were the state with the strongest economy in the country weve been the source of presidents and the source of significant members of the congress i expect us to be treated the way weve always been treated very well
9290515 spendings out of control were running huge budget deficits were running huge trade deficits and i think there are real issues as to our strategy for dealing with the threat of militant islam
9290516 i do think in the short term it was very difficult for any texan whether it was gov rick perry or sen kay bailey hutchison to be seriously considered as a running mate this year but i think that all could change in the future
9290517 youve gotta be frank and look at the presidents ratings nationally theyre under 30 percent and at the moment its oh well its the texan you know
9290518 i definitely feel its important for me to be here this is part of the process that will determine the leader of the free world for the next four years
9290519 at the same time im concerned about the folks who are at home and the folks whose property is in the path of this hurricane
9290520 people in our country i think do like to see a new leaf
9290521 certainly people like to not like texas i think that people have the image that texas is maybe too big for its britches sometimes ive read pundits say that my being from texas was a deterrent but of course id rather be in texas than anywhere
9290522 bush would see vindication of his iraq policy thats what his whole presidency has come down to if that means showing up on monday and graciously bowing away and letting mccain have his moment if thats going to help him get elected i think bush will do that with no problem
9290523 texas is a red state and it will stay a red state
9290524 were such attention getters i dont think since were the second largest delegation that theyll seat us up on the rafters we might not be front and center like we were at the last two conventions but i think that well still have a prominent role
9290525 its not mandatory but we really love to do it
9290526 texas has its own place of high regard within the republican party nationally its a working body and we are there to get some business done too in addition to all the televised events
9290527 we have a lot of team spirit and were well known for our wardrobe that we comply with as a group everybody has a lot of fun with that
9290528 if we were looking at it that way wed be batting 1000 we are three blocks from the xcel center
9290529 texas has had a great run in both parties i think for now its over itll be back
9290530 its just not the year to nominate anybody who has close ties to george bush
9290531 republicans in texas have been very successful with gov bush and then later with gov perry
9290532 texans still see lone star state shining in gop eyes
9290533 given all the attention on this lately well probably go ahead and apply to the joint commission
9290534 but to be frank with you weve always viewed that as more of a public relations issue than a substance issue because we felt that weve already addressed the substantive issues
9290535 excellent 24 7 stroke care already exists in san antonio namely at methodist hospital
9290536 if theres a bad outcome its very bad so this is given with hesitation and appropriate counsel for the family members
9290537 our neurologists realize whats at stake theyre there when we need them
9290538 our goal in creating the brain and stroke network at baptist health system is to raise the level of care for stroke patients in san antonio and south texas
9290539 music has been a love of mine since i was a teenager but our primary purpose is to be here to perform for the soldiers at brooke army medical center
9290540 everybody in the world needs a hobby but for them especially they need to have fun be totally relaxed and just enjoy life
9290541 when you see the bad side youve gotta see a lot more of the good side
9290542 this is great music and good music keeps me happy
9290543 we wanted something that was strictly about us something with san antonio flavor
9290544 its been a very effective event and weve had some very unique acts but there are so many artists that have gotten other gigs because of this job
9290545 its incredible how much talent we have in this town
9290546 a lot of these people have been out there for years they dont have the record deal that willie nelson has but they still contribute to the musical culture of the state of texas
9290547 jacobs well is a regional and statewide natural wonder that is cherished by this community
9290548 i am excited that we are moving ahead on the preserve project
9290549 the future of our water resources is the no 1 issue facing hays county citizens and our elected leaders today
9290550 future generations will benefit from the historic step taken today to protect jacobs well in perpetuity
9290551 no other regulatory agency has a program with such a potentially devastating effect on consumers ability to seek their own remedies
9290552 satisfactory offer or repair or compensation over the life of the program
9290553 the remaining 88 percent of reported cases are pursued by one party or the other using the legal system the very outcome the process was enacted to prevent
9290554 i dont know how much the building community respects the trcc my builder blew it off
9290555 i would love to see them abolished i think that would be the most wonderful thing ever
9290556 i think pulling the cord on the most readily available and cost effective path to resolution is anything but constructive
9290557 every day i get e mails from people who say they have been through the process and their problems are getting resolved
9290558 if youre going to force this kind of process on homeowners there ought to be some sort of guarantee they can get their homes fixed
9290559 homeowners are the ones being regulated theyre the ones being told what they can and cannot do
9290560 before tort reform happened trial attorneys were just eating our industry alive
9290561 we wanted to do dispute resolution before it gets to court anybody who has had the misfortune of being in court knows its a very expensive process and is pretty much only good for the attorney
9290562 id like to see the legislature set another sunset commission review in another three years and lets see how the trcc functions now that its got these additional powers
9290563 its created an incentive for builders to be more proactive
9290564 the legislature would be making a mistake by doing away with trcc completely
9290565 then youre back to nothing that means my constituents that dont have the money or the power to hire attorneys or engineers have no place to go
9290566 it has done nothing to quickly resolve the dispute which is what the agency is supposed to do
9290567 absolutely nothing has been resolved i built my house over three years ago and i cant believe it will be four years when we go to trial
9290568 we have an independent person who will tell us the builder is at fault
9290569 it was a sore subject in my life it was a difficult time but weve been able to move on
9290570 you get to a point in this whole process where youre in it so deep you really cant back out youre sunk
9290571 the arrogance of the builders and the failure of the trcc and the legislature to protect homeowners is unbelievable
9290572 this process has gotten me nowhere i just want my life back
9290573 you just cant deny that the agency was created originally with the significant backing of the building industry itself
9290574 the political reality is you will not be able to move legislation that does not at least have the building community at the table that is just the stark reality of politics in austin if they dont want to abolish the agency i doubt very seriously the agency will be abolished
9290575 i think the commissions stated purpose is laudable and thats to provide consumers an alternative to expensive and time consuming litigation with builders theres nobody thats against that purpose
9290576 i was excited about taking this class its just a passion of mine
9290577 its going to be a challenge but its also such a joy
9290578 we do everything we can to make the adjustment as easy as possible
9290579 nothing prepared us for what we faced in the beginning of the year
9290580 the children didnt understand the concept of school a lot of these students were not bathroom trained or if they were they didnt know how to tell you they had to go i single handedly potty trained eight of those children without a bathroom in my room
9290581 i thought it was so noble that he wanted to run
9290582 it was all him he was definitely the driving force
9290583 theres just not enough space to say good job to everyone
9290584 im genuinely pleased with judge cheshires ruling it is my hope that no further action is necessary in this matter and that i can move to continue working with concerned citizens for the benefit of victoria
9290585 judge asks victoria da to clarify counts against city officials
9290586 he observed many of his friends getting shot and dying
9290587 he was wounded by shrapnel and got trench foot he was hospitalized for several months he got his orders to come home and he was trying to get home in time for our firstborn but he ended up being sent to california and another guy who was trying to go to california got sent to san antonio so he got home three days late
9290588 he said the movie saving private ryan was exactly the way it was
9290589 his time over there was very emotional it was a very important thing for him
9290590 we always teased him that he could be a greeter at wal mart
9290591 i think i have gone a little nuts with this thing
9290592 i think it was just a matter of time before local universities had to jump on board
9290593 i felt like i was obligated to do it because no one else was doing it
9290594 there are a lot of people who are interested but the amount who actually want to do something and help out is a lot smaller
9290595 quite frankly one of our largest costs is solid waste disposal we spend 100 000 a year on it we are looking at how we can reduce costs
9290596 it was just me and her on a hot summer day taking a 55 gallon bin to the baseball field
9290597 do yall have any bins we can put in our dorms
9290598 it is one thing if you have bottom up efforts but unless somebody is there to negotiate the contract and select the next vendor
9290599 we are open to change the students can bring up anything
9290600 i am interested in sustainability but before i go tackle something i would need to know what we can do given the cost we have 7 acres and 28 000 students a large campus may have a harder time doing it
9290601 i have an 11 year old daughter and thats what lit a fire under me
9290602 i wonder what kind of world we will leave her
9290603 you have to pare down your gestures to the most cost effective or you will end up going over budget
9290604 right now we are doing our own little thing in education architecture is doing their thing but we need to begin to talk to each other about it
9290605 i was pretty sure i was safe its definitely frustrating it changes the outcome of the game
9290606 it changes the momentum instead of being down 3 2 they get out of the inning soriano comes up and hits a home run now theyre up 3 2
9290607 people will be literally dying from cold this winter while companies like shell and bp are making record profits that outrages ordinary people and we need a party that is prepared to stand up about that rather than having a labour government that is cowering in a cave and scared of actually speaking out against people in the city
9290608 ensuring that some of the poorest people are able to keep warm
9290609 over a period where we now have victorian levels of social inequality
9290610 seize this opportunity to recognise that with two elections in the next two years we really are poised for this electoral breakthrough
9290611 they might be speaking the green speak but theyre certainly not delivering green action
9290612 if hillary clinton does not win i will vote for john mccain
9290613 so instead of voting for someone obama who shares most of the views of your candidate of choice hillary you would rather vote for the candidate that shares slim to none of the same veiws mccain just to spite the other democratic candidate
9290614 if hillary clinton does not win i will vote for john mccain
9290615 so instead of voting for someone obama who shares most of the views of your candidate of choice hillary you would rather vote for the candidate that shares slim to none of the same veiws mccain just to spite the other democratic candidate
9290616 this alarming figure confirms the anxiety which was expressed by us about the appropriateness of detention for asylum seekers it also confirms the need for a root and branch review of the entire policy
9290617 it is unacceptable to detain people without charge for long periods there is only one proper response to the unacceptably high level of self harm in detention and that is for the government to end the use of detention as part of its asylum policy
9290618 there is an enormous body of evidence that says detaining asylum seekers is bad for their mental health these are people who are very vulnerable
9290619 i speak daily to people in detention and there is no solace you can give to a detainee who does not understand why they have been detained
9290620 they dont treat you like a person there people keeping animals would treat them with more respect
9290621 we werent able to run the football really in any way shape or form whether we spread them or tried to play with a power set we couldnt run the football
9290622 we knew they were going to load the box but we still thought wed be able to knock them off the ball and run the football
9290623 we had a great week in practice and were confident
9290624 we thought they had a little trouble in the middle and they had speed outside so i knew we were going to do that
9290625 their success was just something that caught me off guard i guess
9290626 we didnt get in a flow and we didnt get it going they had the same looks as what we had in practice
9290627 they loaded the box and forced us to throw the ball and we werent able to do it i dont know what it was
9290628 it didnt look like there was a lot of room but until i see it on film i dont really know but it looked pretty stuffed up in there it didnt seem like there was anywhere to go
9290629 i tried to do whatever i could to help the team out
9290630 i tried to capitalize on my opportunities when they came
9290631 my job today was just to make it difficult on them and i feel i did that
9290632 they said turn on your news right now so we did
9290633 weve been glued to the tv for the next we just turned it off for about seven hours
9290634 even though she is not that experienced i think she will rise to that occasion
9290635 does he mccain think thats really going to work i mean does he think that women who are with hillary think hillary is some lego block you know you can take out a red one and put in a green one

9290655 what do you think of senator mccains vice presidential choice and how does it change the dynamics of this campaign
9290656 well i dont know governor palin i have not met her before i had a brief conversation with her after she was selected to congratulate her and wish her luck but not too much luck on the campaign trial and she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and a up and coming public servant
9290657 so its too early for me to gauge what kind of running mate shell be
9290658 marriage is a sacred contract between a man and a woman ordained by god
9290659 alaskas former commissioner of public safety says gov sarah palin john mccains pick to be vice president personally talked him on two occasions about a state trooper who was locked in a bitter custody battle with the governors sister
9290660 in a phone conversation friday night walt monegan who was alaskas top cop until palin fired him july 11 told the daily news that the governor also had e mailed him two or three times about her ex brother in law trooper mike wooten though the e mails didnt mention wooten by name monegan claims his refusal to fire wooten was a major reason that palin dismissed him wooten had been suspended for five days previously based largely on complaints that palins family had initiated before palin was governor
9290661 i have a hard time seeing how her qualifications stack up against the duties and responsibilities of being president i expect her to stick with simple truths when asked about continued american troop presence in iraq she said she knows only one thing about that i paraphrase no one has attacked the american homeland since george bush took the war to iraq
9290662 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9290663 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9290664 is this the most experienced woman they could come up with in the republican party
9290665 after the way hillary was treated by obama and his supporters theres a certain justice in seeing the problem persist karma is a bitch
9290666 instead you have a constant stream over the next 60 days of hillary claire mccaskill nancy pelosi kathleen sebelius janet napolitano and others to nail palin on the issues
9290667 palin said ketchikan had taken a lot of heat for the bridge to nowhere proposal she said she can relate referencing the remark made by sen ben stevens describing mat su residents as valley trash
9290668 ok youve got valley trash standing in the middle of nowhere palin said
9290669 she hasnt communicated with us or spent any time with us the people who helped get her elected are shocked
9290670 shes alienated a lot of the republican base here in ketchikan
9290671 i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9290672 if our state wanted a bridge i said wed build it ourselves
9290673 four months of turmoil have followed in which almost every move by palin has been questioned
9290674 we wondered how her using a city computer to run for lieutenant governor in 2002 was different than republican party chief randy ruedrich using alaska oil and gas conservation commission computers for party business for which he was fined and resigned under pressure she said it was different
9290675 in a release palin fired off to everyone she could think of after the questions she huffed about a smear campaign organized by her enemies powerful enemies later there were references on various radio talk shows to whispering campaigns and
9290676 because too often women are promoted for the wrong reasons and then blamed when things dont go right does the mccain camp really expect pro choice democratic and independent women to be swayed by a sleight of gender
9290677 she came off looking immature herself almost high schoolish it was conduct unbecoming a governor
9290678 governor palin was caught off guard by bob lesters reference to senate president lyda green
9290679 governor you cant say this but i will lyda green is a cancer and a b
9290680 do you have any idea of what you did to make lyda green dislike you hate you
9290681 um you know once and a while i try to figure that out but i cant figure that out
9290682 the governor called senator green to explain that she does not condone name calling in any way and apologized if there was a perception that the comment was attributed to the governor
9290683 she came off looking immature herself almost high schoolish it was conduct unbecoming a governor
9290684 they would have done her in for a hatpin much less a hat

9290689 thank goodness it will remain legal for amateurs to take photographs on the system officious ttc staff need to have this explained to them from time to time
9290690 were incompetent so we need to spend a billion to makeup for it
9290691 its all the fault of david miller and his ndp friends on council
9290692 wootens words were i will kill him hell eat a expletive lead bullet ill shoot him if our father got the attorney to help molly
9290693 i heard this death threat my 16 year old son heard it track palin molly heard it as did their small children wooten spoke with his trooper gun on his hip in an extremely intimidating fashion leaving no doubt he is serious about taking someones life who disagrees with him
9290694 my concern is that the publics faith in the troopers will continue to diminish as more residents express concerns regarding the apparent lack of action towards a trooper whom is described by many as a ticking time bomb and a loose cannon
9290695 wooten is my brother in law but this information is forwarded to you objectively
9290696 im afraid that we may have to look at that situation and well try to monitor it
9290697 but you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day
9290698 im sure that if governor haley barbour thought senator mccain and governor palins presence would in any way distract from the important work theyre doing in advance of the storm he wouldnt have invited them
9290699 they need to know and i know they know they are in our prayers
9290700 we need to be sensitive to this as we go forward
9290701 are making contingency plans should the president decide against traveling to minnesota
9290702 i remember him talking about her when he came back
9290703 he said she was an impressive woman he liked her
9290704 he was down to the point that if the meeting had gone well and it was expected to go well there was going to be an offer
9290705 i dont think he would have invited her if it werent his intention to offer her the job
9290706 nobody was vetted less or more than anyone in the final stages and john had access to all that information and made the decision
9290707 sometimes you open the lid and it will be in there
9290708 overall i think the downtown community would be supportive because you would have open clear alleyways people would be able to see up and down and people wouldnt be able to hide behind them to do illegal activity
9290709 i think most of the community would be supportive depending on how much it costs and the logistics of pickup and how convenient or inconvenient it would be
9290710 in a world of unified formats different businesses are able to compete with one another not through restriction or punishment of rival developers and consumers but rather through innovation added value reasonable cost and a decent level of support
9290711 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9290712 its embarrassing for me to disclose at this time a conversation has occurred again unbeknownst to me
9290713 is event processing a hype or the best invention since sliced bread event processing market from business perspective
9290714 apologies for the truncated column im told that the red socked twats who did the redesign messed up the templates and left me 150 words short

9290723 this is the strongest offer in the aerospace industry it includes pension increases lump sum payments
9290724 i think for people my age its not a bad deal
9290725 but for the younger people theyre the ones that are going to be losing things
9290726 i dont know if theyve just come to accept the fact that they dont have retirement
9290727 and if they dont read the contract theyll just keep taking away stuff until they dont have retirement which is what they want they want to take away their retirements
9290728 we are more than willing to talk to the union and discuss the contract with them in more detail that said this is truly our final offer
9290729 im sorry its 12 01 or the last digit fell so we cant sell you one
9290730 harpers amp queen as it then was was more like tatler
9290731 it was quite exclusive in its readership and was aimed at a smaller audience whats fantastic is that its now come into the mainstream as you can see by the fact beauty brands use us to say endorse their mascara on television
9290732 weve got some big names coming but there will also be one or two women the readers may not necessarily have heard of
9290733 the move away from the society tag has freed us up to do much more and we can now bring in all sorts of exciting different things i dont think theres room for snobbery any more do you
9290734 the beauty of it is we now dont have to worry about who were featuring when it first changed we would think oh god we cant do this or that because people will think its a bit old society for the modern woman but now we can feature debo devonshire for what she has achieved not just because of who she is shes an amazing character its all about the mix its like one big party where you might see a rolling stone next to the duchess of devonshire
9290735 its vogue we find ourselves going up against but we are not trying to be vogue i think vogue has a duty to be the fashion bible probably more slavishly following the catwalks the great thing about bazaar is that we can edit the trends our readers are not going to go out and buy lime green pop socks and silver hot pants because its the fashion actually what theyll do is go and buy say a beautiful lanvin dress
9290736 i suppose its our features were not just about fashion although we have beefed up our fashion coverage a lot
9290737 theres an element of vanity fair were not commissioning 10 000 word features although we do sometimes have a 5 000 word feature if something is relevant to us well do it for example weve got a piece coming up about marriage but by germaine greer and russell brand has done a shoot in which hes the big bad wolf from little red riding hood its about unexpected collaborations
9290738 i like the people we write about to also write for us
9290739 graydon carter says his vanity fair is a society magazine in that its about the people who shape society bazaar is also about society but now its with a small s
9290740 im lucky that i meet all these wonderful people through my work
9290741 i think samantha is amazing for me sam is an absolute bazaar woman shes got a kind of independence to her that a lot of the first ladies perhaps dont there she is being incredibly supportive with her husband but shes also got a very important job in her own right she very much knows her own mind shes interesting and funny shes charming and has a great character thats what i love
9290742 its been an extraordinary marketing achievement camerons been clever playing a quiet game ive met him and i think hes very charismatic but the duty of the magazine is not to tie itself to any political party but to get a sense of whats happening in society and thats what were doing
9290743 we get a bit jealous of american vanity fair because there are all these fabulous colourful characters in us politics and not all of them translate british wise into the pages of bazaar
9290744 yes but i believe magazines need to work a lot harder there are some design changes coming up in the spring
9290745 no if anything id like a bigger version its such a luxurious magazine that we need the big spaces for the images
9290746 it all depends on where you are at what time of life and whats going on in your life personally
9290747 ibiza is where i used to go in my twenties but this time we were in this amazing villa
9290748 you may end this agreement immediately by writing to us if we increase call or other usage charges which have the effect of increasing your call or other usage charges by more than 10 per cent
9290749 it is blatant dishonesty vodafone has raised bills more than 10 per cent in many cases but is not being transparent
9290750 the majority of customers would never read the terms and conditions of their contract but if customers are being refused when they would have rises of more than 10 per cent then vodafone is in breach of contract
9290751 if you call a lot of 0870 numbers which many people do now that more dont have landlines this will affect you
9290752 having exceeded its own limits vodafone has to allow people to leave
9290753 there should be an open door to walk out of the contract undisputed but thats clearly not the case and its a disgrace
9290754 companies are obliged to inform the consumer of the ability to terminate the contract without penalty if the proposed modification is not acceptable to the consumer
9290755 a breach of a general condition could result in a maximum penalty of 10 per cent of relevant turnover
9290756 any customer who thinks they are affected by the problem should get in touch

9290760 i think gordon brown will do a very good job
9290761 in 10 months weve gone from doing ok to certainly not doing ok we patently have not been able to get across what we are for and what we are about
9290762 the prime minister agrees it is a very challenging international economic situation
9290763 this weekend on the eve of the launch of gordon browns heavily trailed recovery plan the governments economic position is falling apart almost hour by hour
9290764 what happened to the senior officer i would suggest absolutely nothing while vast sums of money are spent on justifying the existence of the anti corruption command this is just one more piece of evidence where a blind eye is turned rather than have the metropolitan police service discredited
9290765 to satisfy the authority that the investigation was carried out to the highest standards and that no lines of inquiry were left unexplored

9290769 fuck outta here that nutass pocket on ya jeans dat shit dont even work
9290770 it has a population of only 9 000 8 500 7 500 5 500
9290771 dude she was a mayor of a town with 5 people and a herd of elk
9290772 oh wait that makes obama look bad so i guess that means im going to get buried
9290773 palins credentials dont even extend beyond politics she has a bachelors in journalism she went to a university in idaho and thats about it compare that to obamas academic career and then take your terrible comparison and shove it
9290774 there was snide criticism from the republican establishment that palin fought in her underdog gubernatorial campaign in 2006 after six years as wasillas mayor shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president said state senate president lyda green a wasilla republican who told the anchorage daily news that she at first thought news of palins selection was a joke
9290775 shes going to learn national security at the foot of the master for the next four years and most doctors think that hell be around at least that long
9290776 but whats the message elect us or the chinese will be in new york wait dont they already own most of it
9290777 today i shot a moose in my pajamas how he got in my pajamas ill never know
9290778 i told them we are a better team in our locker room than we showed
9290779 an asset stripping exercise directed as enabling him to carry on its business through another company with a similar name
9290780 the administrators were attempting to negotiate with someone mr foster who they knew to be bereft of the basics of commercial morality he was not to be trusted
9290781 i dont think hes dead hes got places he can go to places scattered around europe these are properties no one knows about he can go and just disappear
9290782 just flipped because the pressure of it was too much for him
9290783 i like up to no one because theyre all balogna
9290784 i went to the welsh baftas in an evening gown that i bought in a charity shop in newtown
9290785 i was just walking through the garden when i saw the plant had flowered
9290786 when i looked closer i could see a bunch of bananas hanging above my head
9290787 and yes there are a lot of pretty girls in powys
9290788 with only one person in every 10 acres it is one of the most sparsely populated local authority areas in england and wales
9290789 my commute to work is 30 miles through beautiful valleys
9290790 he had an impressive cv he was a catalyst he knew what he was doing because he had been a performer producers today are more likely to be young accountants but geoff wasnt interested in number crunching and focus groups geoff perkins was always there he knew so many people and had worked with everybody people knew his face it was twinkly and full of fun i wouldnt see him for a while and then wed bump into each other and it was like it was only yesterday
9290791 some big brands are hoodwinking the public with the food that they put out and labelling in such a way so that pet owners cannot make an informed choice profits are being put before the welfare of pets and its irresponsible to be using all these artificial additives in pet foods when there is so much anecdotal evidence that they cause harm
9290792 over the 12 years ive been a practising vet i have seen a substantial rise in cases of problems caused by poor diet including allergies and intolerances and behavioural issues linked to artificial additives in food
9290793 with so much emphasis on we are what we eat its about time we knew exactly what we were feeding our pets too
9290794 im pretty careful what i put into my own body so i think its outrageous that the pet food industry should be allowed to act in a less than transparent way
9290795 the use of additives in pet food is strictly regulated by the eu
9290796 the authorisation process is rigorous and food pet food additives are regularly reviewed to ensure safety consumers want reassurance on additives but not full listing there is no peer reviewed scientific evidence currently available or that we are aware of to suggest a link between behavioural problems in pets and additives in pet food
9290797 this meeting is hugely significant for our campaign to save north american bears
9290798 if she has a heart and can see the pr nightmare of the mod continuing to support the canadian bear slaughter she can wield her influence and push the mod to scrap the bearskin caps sooner rather than later
9290799 the mod is not opposed to the use of synthetic materials as an alternative to bearskins provided such materials meet the requirement for a high quality product that performs adequately in all weather conditions regrettably a suitable alternative continues to prove elusive
9290800 i cant imagine a more distinct honour than to be asked to redesign the royal guards bearskin hats with the luxurious faux fur i have used in my collections
9290801 i would be delighted to take on this challenge and am confident the outcome would be a wonderful hat that carried on the guards tradition but in a modern way that doesnt involve the taking of bears lives
9290802 we are hoping that we can finally agree on a way forward which displays the will and compassion of the british people and display to the world that we are a caring nation
9290803 the armed services are probably going through a pretty challenging time it is the beginning of the 21st century and the way the army works is changing in these circumstances there is a lot to be said for the importance of tradition of ceremony of wearing the same hat that your grandfather wore
9290804 i understand and appreciate the importance of uniforms but continuing to use real fur in the 21st century is inexcusable regardless of tradition
9290805 the american dream is under siege at home and americas leadership in the world has been weakened
9290806 as a senator mccain has shown his independence on several issues
9290807 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
9290808 psychologists strive to benefit those with whom they work and take care to do no harm
9290809 psychologists strive to benefit those with whom they work and take care to do no harm
9290810 unless they are working directly for the persons being detained or for an independent third party working to protect human rights
9290811 many investors believe october is the worst month for equity market returns this can be partly attributable to the fact some large one day declines have occurred in october
9290812 in actuality though the worst month for market returns is september although the average return in september is negative the magnitude of the decline was no worse than one to 1 5 per cent
9290813 the economy is weaker than the gdp data might suggest and is not expected to repeat the growth of the first half
9290814 risks of another contraction in real gdp will remain elevated through the first half of 2009 as labor and housing markets search for their bottoms
9290815 in the face of gale force winds from the housing credit and commodity markets the economy continues to bend but not break
9290816 we saw a slight improvement in auto sales in july but dont expect to see a major recovery for the remainder of the year
9290817 have spelled recession other indicators not a divergence that should continue in the week ahead
9290818 while economic growth seems to be in the minds of everybody i still worry about inflation
9290819 the trend is clearly upwards and will continue to remain on that path if the federal reserve continues to be as irresponsible as it has been until now
9290820 how long can a business keep prices constant when facing an almost 10 per cent increase in the price of its inputs
9290821 what i also want to say is a growth of almost eight percent is also healthy and impressive we should expect revival to a higher level next fiscal
9290822 so you can also expect the inflation rate to start moderating from the next few months
9290823 inflation will begin softening within a few months time the prices of crude oil appear to be softening in the global market good monsoon will make a big difference
9290824 lot of good things are happening in the states some of them are quite ahead in inking infrastructure projects through the public private partnerships ppps
9290825 andhra pradesh gujarat and maharashtra are doing very well in developing airports through the ppp model andhra pradesh is getting metro train for hyderabad through ppp even health facilities are being upgraded in collaboration with the private parties
9290826 many states want to have metro trains as a metro project is very expensive the states should and are looking for private collaborators the centre will certainly chip in with viability gap funding wherever necessary
9290827 infrastructure projects intended for capacity building have to be implemented with a strong supportive policies and administrative support
9290828 accelerating the pace of ppp contracts in infrastructure is extremely important policies have already been shaped and the ministries are required to the projects fast i think quite a lot has been done
9290829 so its quite low in future this ratio has to go up service sector is one from which the government expects to get more revenue in future
9290830 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving and out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century
9290831 we want 100 per cent evacuation if you decide to stay you are on your own
9290832 this is the mother of all storms this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day that im not sure weve seen anything like it
9290833 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9290834 we are still in the cone of probability especially for a storm surge
9290835 i am strongly encouraging people in the city to evacuate all tourists i ask you to leave do not wait
9290836 they dont want to leave without their dogs i cant blame them i wouldnt leave without mine
9290837 this time we have 1 500 police officers and 1 500 to 2 000 national guard double the amount of protection during katrina
9290838 kementerian memandang serius perkara ini kerana pelbagai amaran telah diberi kepada pengguna siber supaya jangan menyalahgunakan ruang siber untuk tujuan tertentu
9290839 jika kritikan yang diberikan itu betul dan dapat membantu membangunkan negara ia sangat dialu alukan tapi jika ia disalah guna dengan memfitnah atau memburukkan orang lain kerajaan mempunyai tanggungjawab untuk mengambil tindakan
9290840 pertubuhan bangsa bangsa bersatu pbb atau negara barat turut mengecam jika soal agama dipermainkan apatah lagi kita di malaysia
9290841 oleh itu jika seseorang individu membuat kritikan tanpa asas yang kukuh dan cuba untuk memburukkan orang lain pasti tindakan akan diambil
9290842 the peoples republic of china questions the authority of the vermont legislature to enact legislation to protect human life and the environment this attempted interference by the peoples republic of china in the democratic process in vermont is alarming and threatens basic principles of our system of government common sense solutions to health issues at the state and local level should not be subject to international pressure
9290843 this is part of a disturbing trend toward undermining statess rights its simply not ok for other governments to feel that they have a right to intervene in our state legislative process in this way it wouldnt matter whether the bill addressed by the chinese government was about health care workers benefits land use permitting or in this case electronic waste recycling the underlying principle is the same respect for democratic decision making and so we have to let folks in washington dc and in beijing know that this is an unacceptable intrusion
9290844 affirming that states abilities to pass laws and regulations protecting human health and the environment should not be abridged and that ustr will aggressively defend states regulatory powers as a matter of u s federalism
9290845 as illustrated by this event other countries could and are beginning to use the trade system to apply pressure to state legislatures and to impact the state legislative process since trade promotion authority has expired states see an opportunity to evaluate the process for providing input on trade issues and to improve federal state communication a new system for improving communication between states ustr and congress should be a strong priority for the next congress and president to ensure that our democratic system of government is protected
9290846 tariceanu s a chinuit trei ani si jumatate sa ne arate ca este bine crescut ieri probabil batut de soare in cap si a iesit din pepeni si ne a facut asa cum noi nu ne permitem sa facem pe nimeni

9290860 formerly a president of the socccd faculty association i retired as a full time saddleback instructor after 28 years
9290861 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
9290862 i think he has done pretty well so far what do you think
9290863 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
9290864 now despite being complicit in this catastrophic foreign policy john mccain says barack obama isnt ready to protect our national security
9290865 now let me ask you whose judgment should we trust should we trust john mccain
9290866 i really thought things were going to get tense but in the end it was all so emotional holding hands and cheering and dancing to love train
9290867 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
9290868 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
9290869 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
9290870 barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home
9290871 sounds familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
9290872 the single most important thing i have to make clear is the choice we have in november between the same failed policy of the last eight years for the middle class and the new agenda to boost income for americans and help families who are struggling i will make that contrast very clearly
9290873 in terms of his speech obama has got to do two things he has to rally his base and he has to reach out to independent voters
9290874 to get people focused on the economy because that is the area of his strength but he also has to reassure people in the areas where they are not as confident of him
9290875 this democratic convention has a vibe so weird and jittery so at odds with the early thrilling fairy dust feel of the obama revolution
9290876 i couldnt understand why he would organize a convention to give the clintons two nights and then diss hillary as vice president
9290877 we went out and demi was dancing up on me and humping me from behind
9290878 she was lactating at the time and she was squirting breast milk at my lesbian friends
9290879 my friend michelle called me the next morning and asked me how do i get breast milk out of my black dress
9290880 lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama will be our presidential nominee
9290881 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
9290882 i want you to know that this has been a joy yes we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time
9290883 he will be addressing the single largest audience he will have at any time between now and the election so its important to use the event to make clear where he stands on matters that are worrying voters
9290884 obama is the first presidential candidate who reminds me of kennedys eloquence and capacity to inspire they both despite their own special backgrounds convey to people that they understand and listen to every american citizen
9290885 he is blessed with a richly resonant voice that we love to hear he could read the telephone directory and it would sound good
9290886 he is very good at pauses and inflection and he cuts an impressive figure on stage all of which adds up to making an obama speech a special event
9290887 on the one hand he cant go wrong in invoking such an iconic speech that has become part of americana on the other hand the more obama talks about race the blacker he becomes and america still has a massive race problem
9290888 the single most important thing i have to make clear is the choice we have in november between the same failed policy of the last eight years for the middle class and the new agenda to boost income for americans and help families who are struggling i will make that contrast very clearly
9290889 in terms of his speech obama has got to do two things he has to rally his base and he has to reach out to independent voters
9290890 to get people focused on the economy because that is the area of his strength but he also has to reassure people in the areas where they are not as confident of him
9290891 this democratic convention has a vibe so weird and jittery so at odds with the early thrilling fairy dust feel of the obama revolution
9290892 i couldnt understand why he would organize a convention to give the clintons two nights and then diss hillary as vice president
9290893 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities minneapolis st paul because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
9290894 china has obtained good experience in the past few years in the extraction of heavy oil and it has managed to increase its heavy oil production using chemical polymer and thermal compositions
9290895 one of the aims of the nioc delegation to china last week was the signing of an agreement in regard to heavy oil reserves technology transfer and management

9290900 the take home message is that a patient with mastitis does not necessarily need an antibiotic against mrsa
9290901 she will improve with a less specific antibiotic as long as she also empties her breasts either through feeding or pumping and if theres an abscess gets it treated
9290902 the physician can take the time to test the patient to determine what kind of bacteria she has
9290903 we found that youre not going to put the patient at a disadvantage if you start her on antibiotics while you wait for culture results then switch her to more powerful medication if she has mrsa
9290904 women should seek medical care if they have any symptoms or concerns for breast infections
9290905 we could have the most powerful anti hacking force in the world but wed still have no computers so we couldnt do anything
9290906 the government thinks about guns tanks and raiding houses hackers just arent a priority
9290907 now the government is starting to use computers everywhere but these computers arent protected
9290908 if that information had fallen into the hands of terrorists it would have been a catastrophe
9290909 there are hackers in iraq thats fantastic it implies a level of normalcy i didnt know was there
9290910 if iraqis can be hackers it means they have food shelter and clothing and theyre not terrified for their lives
9290911 tropical storm gustav was back in focus despite reassurances from the iea international energy agency and the us department for energy that they were ready to tap into emergency oil reserves in case the storm causes significant supply disruption in the gulf of mexico
9290912 the focus is likely to remain on tropical storm gustav and potential supply disruptions during the weekend and earlier next week
9290913 still we have to worry about the hurricanes effect on this market
9290914 the take home message is that a patient with mastitis does not necessarily need an antibiotic against mrsa

9290936 quando sei sposato non puoi sublimare il dolore con le donne e altre droghe varie
9290937 it was a turning point in my life a conjunction of timing maturity luck and attraction all the pieces fell into place when youre married you have to deal with yourself you cant sublimate your pain with drugs and other women or should that be women and other drugs
9290938 im sorry its 12 01 or the last digit fell so we cant sell you one
9290939 human standards changed overtime but gods decision is perfect god is not affected by time of human standard when it gives guidance
9290940 the combination of obamas liberal record his middle name hussein and his blackness those three things are enough to put an elderly southern conservative into a state of shock
9290941 i was hoping that most of the turmoil in this community was behind us but it was just starting it was like a cancer in the whole community it wouldnt go away no matter how much people wanted it to
9290942 who need to be brought before the bar of justice
9290943 theres still a racial edge people still see things in black and white its deeply ingrained the mindset is whites vote republican blacks democrat
9290944 if a black man stood for president you would just say no way no way
9290945 the generation that wouldnt contemplate a black president is passing on and thats good for everybody if its not now its just around the corner we will no longer be denied
9290946 its a feeling you cant put into words its like we are no longer a subculture finally its given us reason to think we are part of the overall scheme of things
9290947 any democratic candidate who gets a big turnout of black voters is off to a very good start its just getting that other 20 thats difficult
9290948 i honestly thought this would be different i mean were not in the 60s any more but it really became a big issue for me
9290949 i asked her was there a problem with the fact that he was black she told me i had to get out
9290950 you dont want a president with no connection to christianity
9290951 when you drive through white neighborhoods i dont think youll see many obama signs or bumper stickers people who vote for him will do it quietly they dont know who he is what his religion is is he the antichrist
9290952 id like reassurance about who he is whos backing him just to be sure theres not an underlying current
9290953 that he does turn out to be a muslim after all
9290954 i dont have anything against a black man as president
9290955 but obama hes not qualified when you are president you represent everyone not just your race ive heard him talk about his people
9290956 and what about his religion he cant just drop his religion
9290957 well he should make it clear he stands by christian values in america that he doesnt hold those other values
9290958 i dont think hes done that at all hes just run from it he should have nipped it in the bud and made clear hes a president for everybody
9290959 just because hes a muslim he should make it clear he doesnt believe in suicide bombing and killing
9290960 theyre going to try and make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
9290961 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
9290962 roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
9290963 call me crazy but isnt it possible just possible that obamas lead is being inhibited by the fact that he is you know black
9290964 the northern system of segregation has never been about symbols of power on the streets separate water fountains but about segregated neighbourhoods and workplaces
9290965 states like ohio are so close that just a couple of percent of voters who decide not to vote for him on grounds of race could swing the result
9290966 not just because hes black though thats a very good start but because he has no experience
9290967 if blacks come in here we really dont have anything available for them
9290968 some people wonder what im doing here let alone a black president of the united states
9290969 a black president thats a tough sell obama could be all right now but come november people might say not yet
9290970 theres a lot of people who dont want a black man in the white house
9290971 it would say that we as a country have arrived theres a need for redemption there always will be an obama presidency will provide some of that redemption
9290972 benny is a baker benny makes zucchini bread it takes him six eggs to make one loaf of bread seems a bit high cholesterol to me thought we were trying to work on this childhood health and obesity thing if benny wants to make six nine twelve loaves of bread how many eggs will he need what does the rule look like

9291007 over the four years the audit found that 63 417 people failed to attend the programme for various reasons which led to the government having to fork out the money to camp operators due to the way the contract was set out

9291010 if she cant stand the heat she should stay out of the kitchen
9291011 there was snide criticism from the republican establishment that palin fought in her underdog gubernatorial campaign in 2006 after six years as wasillas mayor shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president said state senate president lyda green a wasilla republican who told the anchorage daily news that she at first thought news of palins selection was a joke
9291012 ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the v p does every day
9291013 i think she is the most inexperienced person on a major party ticket in modern history
9291014 obama has had 2 years in the senate and 7 years in the state senate 9 years i dare any of those digging me down to show me where those numbers are inaccurate
9291015 zomg palin was a mayor for 10 years she is better than obama and ready to be president
9291016 he gave a speech at the democratic convention in 2004
9291017 update after reading this article the mccain campaign issued the following statement
9291018 but out of the box picks in recent years have not usually worked out too well for the top of the ticket
9291019 now i know stockdales name has become a buzzword in this culture for doddering old man but lets look at the record folks the guy was the first guy in and the last guy out of vietnam a war that many americans including our present president did not want to dirty their hands with the reason he had to turn his hearing aid on at that debate is because those animals knocked his eardrums out when he wouldnt spill his guts he teaches philosophy at stanford university hes a brilliant sensitive courageous man and yet he committed the one unpardonable sin in our culture he was bad on television
9291020 it was terribly frustrating because i remember i started with
9291021 in fact as palins cultural views become better known she oppose abortion in all cases and opposes the use of birth control pills and condoms even among married couples
9291022 gustav is going to pardon the pun take some of the thunder out of the republicon convention
9291023 i have no idea why many conservatives have problems with the opinion of people who are experts in their fields vs a john doe
9291024 id rather entrust the government of the united states to the first 400 people listed in the boston telephone directory than to the faculty of harvard university
9291025 the authors quote four scholars attacking gov palins fitness for the office of vice president among them david kennedy is a maxed out obama donor joel goldstein is also an obama donor and doris kearns goodwin has donated exclusively to democrats this cycle finally matthew dallek is a former speech writer for dick gephardt this is not a story about scholars questioning gov palins credentials so much as partisan democrats who would find a reason to disqualify or discount any nominee put forward by sen mccain
9291026 its like communicating with a crazed red guard mind numb socialist
9291027 i bet youre really well read i bet you love to read
9291028 ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the v p does every day

9291046 so goes the repetitive if ever deepening tragedy of our other war and under such headlines lie massive tragedies that seldom make the headlines anywhere ann jones who has spent much time as a humanitarian aid worker in afghanistan these last years and wrote a moving book kabul in winter on her experiences turns to one of those tragedies the fate of afghan women
9291047 during the past year a rash of reports on the situation of women in afghanistan has been issued by afghan governmental agencies and by foreign and local non governmental organizations ngos that claim a particular interest in womens rights or in afghanistan or both more reports are in the offing what has sparked them is the dire situation of women in the country the systematic violations of their human rights and the failure of concerned parties to achieve significant improvements by providing women with legal protections rooted in a capable honest and stable judiciary system education and employment opportunities safety from violence much of it savage and protection from hidebound customs originating in the conviction that women are the property of men
9291048 the citizens of afghanistan whether man or woman have equal rights and duties before the law

9291062 in his unstoppable commentary about himself bush has become as certain of his exalted place in history as he is of his policys rightness he projects his image into the future willing his enshrinement as a great president history has become a magical incantation for him a kind of prayerful refuge where he is safe from having to think in the present for bush history is supernatural a deus ex machina nothing less than a kind of divine intervention enabling him to enter presidential valhalla through his fantasy about history as afterlife the stairway to paradise he rationalizes his current course
9291063 he is prejudiced against the cia the day after the 2004 election when bush won mccain came on tv and gave an interview in which he said something to the effect of the cia tried to sabotage this election theyve made their bed and now they have to lay in it i used to like mccain but he is inconsistent
9291064 with cia leaks intended to harm the re election campaign of the president of the united states it is not only dysfunctional but a rogue organization

9291079 but the simple fact that no developer can set up his or her own android market
9291080 the android market offers much more freedom and inclusiveness than apples app store
9291081 in an entry posted on the official android developer blog google mobile platform program manager eric chu says that the android market will be open to all third party developers and applications will not have to be vetted prior to inclusion

9291090 the obama campaign has clearly decided to maintain the campaign against mccain for what it truly is more of the same no matter who mccains v p choice is its almost as if theyre minimizing her like mccain minimized the vice presidency
9291091 i picked biden because hillary hurt my feelings nobody hurts my feelings ask jeremiah wright

9291141 the fact that john mccain does not know how many houses he owns when millions are struggling to stay in the only house they have shows hes out of touch with the lives of real americans
9291142 mccain is promising to double down on the economic policies of george w bush which have benefited corporations and ceos while leaving middle class families behind john mccain just doesnt get it
9291143 the issue here isnt the wealth of the mccain family its that senator mccain is out of touch when he says that the fundamentals of our economy are strong and that the bush economy has made great progress when most americans are actually losing ground
9291144 despite that fact there have been a lot of messages posted on my web site and i really appreciate it

9291532 but you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9291533 gt after more than two decades the knopf farm produce stand on cooley road in canandaigua will no longer be open for business
9291534 ive been coming here for 20 years and have never found anything like it its the only corn my father will eat
9291535 sometimes people would even leave an iou for 10 cents and then come back the next day to pay off their debt
9291536 i am so thankful to everyone who ive met and become friends with over the years the people who stop by the stand are like family to me and i will miss every single one of them
9291537 we love this stand and i dont know what we are going to do without it
9291538 we have become such good friends with lorelei and her family
9291539 i volunteer so that lorelei can take a break every once in a while
9291540 its not the same though because people are always disappointed not to see her here they ask for the girl in pink boots lorelei always wears the same boots
9291541 it taught my kids responsibility and helped pay for some of their college
9291542 we continue to remind gulf coast residents about the importance of taking precautionary measures to prepare for an emergency situation or evacuation before gustav approaches our shores
9291543 the departments ready campaign encourages citizens to get an emergency supply kit make an emergency plan and stay informed of instructions from local authorities
9291544 an impermissible sanction and serves as an obstacle to the objectives of the federal government
9291545 it was made to turn back the clock im glad its gone for the sake of academic freedom
9291546 our initial impression is there are some folks who are happy to see us there are other folks who are probably reluctant at best because of the taliban presence thats been there for so long
9291547 all night last night there was wind but not like now now its very strong things are starting to fall down
9291548 yes we wrote a letter to the united nations security council saying were responsible for the acts of our employees our people but it doesnt mean that we did it in fact
9291549 i think they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters
9291550 the negotiation with them it was very terrible and very materialistic and was very greedy they were asking for more money and more money and more money
9291551 she wants the mayor to plead guilty to a felony
9291552 the facts alleged by the plaintiff utterly fail utterly fail to demonstrate the absence of fair and just treatment
9291553 it is the governors responsibility not to punish the defendant it is to protect the public
9291554 there are no safe havens in iraq for al qaida every cell taken down degrades their capability and saves iraqis lives
9291555 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9291556 to have it planned at the same time that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river
9291557 just bought lunch from a gas station convenience store guess thats a sign that life is moving fast today
9291558 just had a killer waffle bar i had bacon duty
9291559 i ate the cupcake and then the stringcheese i should have done the reverse
9291560 eating a peppermint life saver i love these little candies
9291561 just ate some greek food with a bad story teller at least he was animated
9291562 either way i dont see sapp or pittman making this team its a numbers game from what i can tell you figure with young hall aldridge and torain there isnt enough room for 7 hb fbs the only way i see both those guys on the team is if denver cuts aldridge and puts torain on the pup
9291563 will there be audio or video podcasts i can see from blogorlando
9291564 as for that vp talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day
9291565 which rpg genres are best suited to long term campaigns
9291566 terimakasih kepada mereka mendoakan dan mengelus saya menjadi calon presiden tapi bukan saya meniadakan doa yang terpenting itu kan juga menusuk memilih saya ya berdoa dan menusuk saya
9291567 itu tidak aneh karena bisa berkonotasi macam macam buat saya sih itu aneh dan mengerikan ya lucu juga sih kalau yang bicara itu julia perez atau dewi persik hahahaha
9291568 even in the apostles days christians were too apt to strive after a wrong unity and uniformity in outward practices and observations and to judge one another unrighteously in these matters and mark it is not the different practice from one another that breaks the peace and unity but the judging of one another because of different practices for this is the true ground of love and unity not that such a man walks and does just as i do but because i feel the same spirit and life in him and that he walks in his rank in his own order in his proper way and place of subjection to that and this is far more pleasing to me than if he walked just in that track wherein i walk
9291569 i am such and such and they way over there are other but i am okay with that and i need not make them like me for them to be fine
9291570 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
9291571 a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
9291572 it is that promise thats always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family
9291573 i will end i will build and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
9291574 but this too is part of americas promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
9291575 instead it is that american spirit that american promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend
9291576 at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess thank you god bless you and god bless the united states of america
9291577 uploads have been between 1 400 and 4 500 images a minute
9291578 look daddy i found a little grown up hes the same size as me
9291579 an entirely new medium synths constitute an entirely new visual medium photosynth analyzes each photo for similarities to the others and uses that data to estimate where a photo was taken it then re creates the environment and uses that as a canvas on which to display the photos the potential uses of photosynth can range from sharing experiences to storytelling and documentation
9291580 by terrence stutz the dallas morning news 8 29 08
9291581 after this call i really hated myself hated how im acting these days im putting myself in situations that i regret afterwards i give people the chance to make fun of me im talking too much im letting out more than i should im no longer keeping any thing as private for myself
9291582 our resources from our department and our partner agencies are on standby ready to deploy with the call is necessary
9291583 whether its to evacuate or contra flow lanes are necessary those resources are on standby and are ready to go
9291584 republicans know how to fill a football stadium with screaming people too they filled the superdome during hurricane katrina
9291585 we learn to be freed from our inner pharaohs travel in our wilderness and form our own dreams of the promised land
9291586 the participants at this event which sold out three weeks before were jews christians and muslims
9291587 there was a strong interfaith resurgence driven by the desire of many people perhaps christians especially to get to know their religious neighbors
9291588 lohre says grassroots efforts have sprung up in many places
9291589 when we first started the three of us were like three circles touching
9291590 but over time our circles have become more interlocked we are still distinct circles but we share more and more together
9291591 the assertion that at root all religions are the same just isnt true if you do any kind of careful comparative religion you understand just how different religious traditions are
9291592 i must find a way to connect with another faith without taking on its identity what we are doing is acknowledging other faiths as legitimate paths to a shared universal
9291593 i think christians have misunderstood the great commission when jesus says go and make disciples of all nations we think he means go and make christians of all nations but he doesnt say that to be a disciple of god means to be a disciple of love maybe he means that we are called to help people find the way of love
9291594 we have a lot of work to do to heal the rifts in our own family
9291595 a line written by jamal about which i said if that line is in the book then i am not in the book
9291596 the wall may keep out suicide bombers but it cannot keep out the cries of oppression and injustice that could break through a thousand walls
9291597 what kept us talking what allowed us to wander into this territory and stay while we tried to understand each other better was that we were already longtime friends
9291598 i feel as if i were being speared by the hyphen
9291599 christians and jews share the same god but allah is a different matter
9291600 i dont think jesus would have said what you did about muslims
9291601 o humankind we have created you out of a single pair of a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes that you might come to know one another
9291602 erase blackheads with the new blackhead eraser it really works
9291603 by adhering to virtue by fulfilling all pledges and by giving up futile apprehensions
9291604 300 fietsers trokken door de leuvense binnenstad ze wilden een fietsbrug tussen kessel lo en leuven
9291605 in antwerpen willen ze geen brug en wij willen er juist wel een waarom kunnen we dan niet gewoon ruilen
9291606 in kessel lo zijn de borstelstraat en de gemeentestraat verschrikkelijk onveilig waarom is fietsen door het provinciaal recreatiedomein dan verboden
9291607 now no one expects us to agree on everything whether in juneau or in washington but we are expected to govern with integrity and good will and clear convictions and a servants heart
9291608 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
9291609 did you see her speech she did really well even if she didnt really have much time to prepare one
9291610 that was better than riding the chairlift but when do i get my prosciutto bone
9291611 i just cut it up so it would look more like generic nondescript meat
9291612 nbc apparently got about 72 million video streams during this olympics season and is touting this as a great success its true that this is a lot more than any previous olympics but i dont think nbc has anything to crow about remember this is the most famous sporting event in the world and it got non stop media coverage for close to a month yet in a country with 300 million people they only got a total of 72 million streams thats less than one stream for every 4 americans
9291613 those are words that ring in the american national anthem on american licence plates in the american declaration of independence
9291614 the site hadn t been up for 48 hours when staff from adobe first contacted us and the response has been very positive we re currently in touch with a couple of people at adobe and working with them to craft all the gripes here into something they can use and hopefully take to heart
9291615 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve experienced in the history of humankind
9291616 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
9291617 no one is better than you everyone is your equal and everyone is equal to you
9291618 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
9291619 there doesnt seem to be a place for me as a christian in my local uu church
9291620 a christianity worth believing hope filled open armed alive and well faith
9291621 reverend x how generation x ministers are shaping unitarian universalism
9291622 i am a christian but i dont believe in christianity
9291623 i am not conflicted because i struggle to believe i am conflicted because i want to believe differently
9291624 whether we know it or not the dogmas and doctrines that many of us were taught are so firmly embedded in the cultural context of another time that they have become almost meaningless in ours
9291625 but for me the idea of following a god who is in all things who is inviting us to join in the work that is true and noble and pure is so beautiful and so appealing that i cant imagine why we would offer anything else
9291626 the weight of biblical influence religiously intellectually historically and culturally on the uu tradition and its practices and on the collective uu worldview is heavier than any of the other sources the general failure of uus to be honest about the past and present influence of christianity and the bible on the uu tradition is a self deception that hinders uus understanding of themselves their theologies and their social location
9291627 one reason often cited to explain why christianity became so effective in co opting and replacing many pagan religions is that it is more intuitive for people to relate to human narratives like the stories of jesus and mary and joseph than it is to relate to a sacred bull or a holy rock or other abstract deities icons or totems
9291628 we believe in jesus christ the everlasting son of god the express image of the father in whom dwelt all the fullness of the god head bodily and who to us is the way and the truth and the life
9291629 anglican in worship congregational in polity and unitarian in theology
9291630 i remembered that he and i were there for the same reason
9291631 the ones who dont pay much attention to minor things like corruption on the part of their elected officials
9291632 players can twist tilt and turn through numerous skateboarding sessions
9291633 creators based mainly in south east asia such as singapore malaysia thailand and vietnam
9291634 the marvel universe will and were not joking never be the same again
9291635 explores what leads a group of teens to commit a heinous crime
9291636 the perfect gift for your pastor cellmate or parents or even the calendar for your office
9291637 the hero initiative has something scary on page 285 yes its stans soapbox the collection featuring all yes all of stan lees columns from 1967 to 1980 with historical context so we know what the heck hes talking about now it sounds pretty cool but can any sane person deal with that much concentrated stan
9291638 they must be tuned to the same old fart classic rock station
9291639 with having published a false scandalous and malicious attack on the character of the president of the united states with an intent to excite the hatred and contempt of the people of this country against the man of their choice
9291640 no no you have so much talent much more than any of us
9291641 oppose the ma governments de taiwanisation and harming national sovereignty
9291642 i think obamas going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
9291643 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
9291644 just the place for a snark i have said it twice
9291645 just the place for a snark i have said it twice
9291646 when i was a kid i said air poop instead of fart
9291647 every time they have one of those wedding dress super sales i think hey maybe i should just go stock up
9291648 so after ender kills the buggers haha oops spoiler just kidding youve finished it right oh well he kills them

9291652 just the place for a snark i have said it twice
9291653 i was on a mission to close the gap on the ford team but got onto the wrong part of the road on a long left hand corner and had the spin
9291654 i wasnt able to make up the gap to mikko i thought it was over and wed lost the chance but then it all changed and we were leading again
9291655 this was really a difficult rally changing all the time with some strategy coming in too
9291656 i needed to win for sure and thats very nice but im not happy for what happened to mikko because he was doing really well and it was a good battle but its a race and these things happen sometimes
9291657 i was really confident that we were going to win this rally but what could we do
9291658 we had a slow puncture that dropped us to third but im not going to let this knock my confidence
9291659 i know we can win rallies the season isnt over yet so we just have to go flat out again on the next rallies
9291660 we want to win not get fourth im sorry but were not here for fun we have to improve the speed
9291661 we cannot let the situation in the country go on like this
9291662 it must be over but i will not do anything that will create a bad atmosphere the announcement of an emergency decree would create a bad atmosphere in the country and to the world
9291663 what they the pad are trying to do now is overthrow the government
9291664 they seized government offices airports is this democracy or is this is the peoples alliance to destroy democracy
9291665 i told you before that i will not resign i will stay on to run this country
9291666 we are worried that the pad will come here so we are here to protect the people
9291667 following the tracks it had made when it descended into the 800 meter diameter half mile diameter bowl nearly a year earlier

9291672 always given the highest importance of all to respect for this craft which is not exactly an art but which needs an artist to exist
9291673 to be beautiful all a woman needs is a black pullover and a black skirt and to be arm in arm with a man she loves
9291674 along with thousands of pounds worth of clothes and jewellery
9291675 we have to get the make up applied as far down your chest as possible otherwise it wont look right trust me im a professional
9291676 t shirt and a big black cowboy hat he spent most of the concert roaming the arena while we just enjoyed the show we eventually lost track of him entirely
9291677 hey man have you seen a gorilla in a zz top t shirt wearing cowboy boots
9291678 the wall tasted like collard greens and i prefer strawberries
9291679 i saw enough to make me cry on planet earth
9291680 this is what we are and this is what we do
9291681 when jesus returns those christians who are alive at the time will be caught up into the air to meet him
9291682 this was not designed to piss of the internet just be a good old fashioned supehero story
9291683 oh man with the remastering you can totally see kirks corset or i mean what did he wear a girdle didnt he wear a girdle wow you can totally see his girdle oh wait i just explained william shatners entire acting style he cant speak well bcuz hes wearing a girdle and it cuts off the circulation
9291684 mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused
9291685 you cant be president the outrageous barriers to democracy in america
9291686 buh dup de dup im nawt rushin around like a fool im nawt moovin
9291687 dunno if you want to trust my taste apparently its questionable
9291688 shannone was so much better than any of you omg now i am gonna lose
9291689 but i just deserve it more than any of them do
9291690 the picture was taken with a blackberry 8100 series camera phone this picture was supposed to be of the sun rays coming out of the clouds in the distance on 8 15 08 but after it was taken and we looked at what was in the picture we notice several strange looking ufos in it
9291691 she can look you in the eye and tell you black is white
9291692 i send greetings to muslims observing ramadan in america and around the globe
9291693 i thank the men and women of the muslim community for their contributions to america your love of family and gratitude to god have strengthened the moral fabric of our country our nation is stronger and more hopeful because of the generosity talents and compassion of our muslim citizens
9291694 an outstanding choice that should be extremely reassuring to the conservative base
9291695 gives us confidence he will keep his pledges to voters regarding the kinds of justices he would nominate to the supreme court
9291696 a woman of faith who has a strong position on life a consistent opinion on judges shes the complete package
9291697 the question is how this will be received by a lot of rank and file evangelicals who are just americans struggling along going to their megachurches and care about values
9291698 mccain is saying to social and religious conservatives im taking your views incredibly seriously
9291699 when it comes to this particular threat to human rights human rights commissions just dont get it
9291700 human rights commissions like generals are fighting the last war they do not see new threats until they are overwhelmed by them if out of generosity than for no other reason we should assume ignorance rather than wilful blindness then the remedy is education and training
9291701 successfully hijacked un institutions to impose its own radicalized agenda
9291702 neither the conservatives nor the liberals have any interest in this their effort is to appease these islamist groups they dont wish to offend and therefore the islamists can walk over and literally blackmail politicians and the liberal intelligentsia into not saying a word about it
9291703 those who advocate freedom of expression often go on to deny the equal right to be protected from advocacy of hatred the holocaust did not begin with censorship it began with hate speech auschwitz was built with words the killing fields of cambodia were sowed with slogans the genocide of rwanda was spread by radio bosnia was ethnically cleansed by television
9291704 the time constraints on me and resource constraints too meant i havent been able to do anything comprehensively so what ive really aimed to do is just make sure i spoke to a representative group those who have grave reservations and those who support the idea so that i would hopefully get the full range of perspective
9291705 we had kicked the devil out of a couple people in bowl games and the president of the united states at that time went down into texas with a southern strategy and announced that texas was the national championship boos
9291706 hello john so nice to see you again please come in
9291707 hes gay has a good job has always been polite whenever ive spoken to him and hes gay
9291708 just because theyre gay doesnt mean you need to set me up with them secondly kavanaghs polite to you because youre his boss and thirdly he tried to feel me up in the restaurant
9291709 because if you dont stop trying to play match maker swear i am going to come into this office after every single disaster date you set me up on and fill you in on all the gory details
9291710 the doors actually work better if you let them close
9291711 if i didnt does that mean im not youre favorite uncle anymore
9291712 hes also hot in a quirky geeky sort of way
9291713 dave told me about the promise you blackmailed out of him this afternoon
9291714 so he made me promise that id do the match making from now on
9291715 i hardly have the same taste in men that dave does
9291716 i dont know where the two of you got the idea that i needed help with my love life but i really wish youd leave it to me
9291717 obama put his country first when he picked biden mccain put his campaign first
9291718 because the iranian media and fringe western media hasnt been repeating this for the past year
9291719 definitely worth pointing out and thank you for that id read it had the highest circulation or
9291720 why i think missional theology is the future of theology
9291721 when our students walk through the doors for the first day sept 15 theres going to be a great sense of joy and a deep sense of gratitude
9291722 weve always hoped and dreamed of having our own building
9291723 and the fact that our lease downtown was coming to an end this summer added to the impetus to move forward
9291724 its pretty amazing to think that a little more than a year ago we were standing in the middle of a field here
9291725 and were going to be comfortable walking distance from a station of the new southwest leg of the lrt when its built
9291726 the small class sizes are a major selling point to prospective students but our emphasis on faith on a holistic education is the heart of why were here
9291727 our ethos is obviously a christian one but we welcome students of all backgrounds we want them to lead effectively whether its inside the church or in a secular profession
9291728 i like to think of ambrose as being at the intersection of learning and faith
9291729 we want to emphasize the values of compassion integrity service and truth
9291730 any university worth its salt for the last 10 or 15 years has recognized the need to change to be more accommodating to the significant and growing diversity that all campuses are experiencing
9291731 the centre was a case of build it and they will come
9291732 we provide daily noon prayers for the sunni muslim community and daily evening prayers for the ismaili muslim community we provide space for a weekly buddhist congregation on campus and a couple of times a week the building is filled with the sound of evangelical christian praise music
9291733 im looking at him right now and i see perfection
9291734 yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
9291735 this series collides with our islamic religion values and traditions
9291736 our society does not allow men to be romantic like muhannad
9291737 in our environment with all the stress it is very difficult to be romantic
9291738 i love it because of the love stories and how the problems are solved
9291739 egyptian soap operas are only 30 episodes but this one has become a part of our lives
9291740 it has destroyed the character of the young and old
9291741 because shes strong even though her husband left her and she always tries to bring the family together
9291742 this show makes my daughter grow up stronger she wont be a slave to her husband shell be independent
9291743 while she was governor members of her family and staff tried to get her ex brother in law fired from the alaska state troopers her public safety commissioner would not do so she forced him out supposedly for other reasons
9291744 bloody deregulate the entire energy system isnt that what reagan would do
9291745 scientists predictions that global warming will eliminate the ice where the bears live in summer were unreliable
9291746 anchorage daily news reported in may that the head of the marine mammals program for the alaska department of fish and game and two other marine mammal biologists on his staff agreed with nine studies the federal government cited to justify listing polar bears as a threatened species
9291747 its clear that mccain picked palin for reasons of image not substance shes a woman she has fought corruption she has fought the oil companies shes married to a union member these are portrayals for campaign speeches they are not policy positions
9291748 how can we as a society move towards brothers and sisters as a nation
9291749 the cult of the presidency americas dangerous devotion to executive power
9291750 he could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement that he would then target those that had voted them in to office
9291751 obama put his country first when he picked biden mccain put his campaign first
9291752 because the iranian media and fringe western media hasnt been repeating this for the past year
9291753 definitely worth pointing out and thank you for that id read it had the highest circulation or
9291754 there is no government in jerusalem that would ever reconcile itself to a nuclear iran
9291755 when it is clear iran is on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons an israeli military strike to prevent this will be seriously considered
9291756 the operation described as extremely successful was halted recently in connection with plans for an impending us air attack on iran along with this targets would also be bombed which were connected with the dutch espionage action
9291757 one of the agents involved who was able to infiltrate the iranian industry under the supervision of the aivd was recently recalled because the us was thought to be making a decision within weeks to attack iran with unmanned aircraft
9291758 obama put his country first when he picked biden mccain put his campaign first
9291759 because the iranian media and fringe western media hasnt been repeating this for the past year
9291760 definitely worth pointing out and thank you for that id read it had the highest circulation or
9291761 mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused
9291762 you cant be president the outrageous barriers to democracy in america
9291763 when something tastes good and rich you are likely to eat less of it anyway
9291764 sahar an afghan refugee and graduate student in politics at auckland was supposedly scheduled to begin training in the ureweras when the raids happened
9291765 obviously the play fell off in 07 and we just havent seen a lot of change thus far this year

9291775 reflects the bare minimum that could be done for a former president
9291776 you cant give him a podium because people will draw the conclusion
9291777 i wouldnt let him within 100 miles of the convention center because it would be used by an unscrupulous republican party that doesnt care about the truth in character assassination against our candidate
9291778 michelle spoke last night barack is going to speak thursday night and the other two nights are for the clintons
9291779 so i didnt want to intrude i didnt need to get on the stage and make a speech
9291780 he has spoken at a number of these things in the past
9291781 he hasnt shown respect to israel and many of the jewish constituencies here based on the things he has done
9291782 i think its hard to ask a political party to take a former president and say were not going to hear you at all
9291783 the party is very sensitive to the american jewish community and its very sensitive to ever conveying that this is anything but a pro israel party
9291784 carrick is often a forgotten town but this is a great day for carrick if it wasnt for the musical society this job would never have got done nobody was going to give us a theatre and if we hadnt got the theatre the society would have folded

9291813 i had the minister in and gave him hell i told him of all the ridiculous things to do to bring
9291814 i was born into this particular community i have deep personal feelings on the issue
9291815 i was not immunized because my parents were taught that to do so was defying god who you were to trust for your well being my faith had played no part in this decision yet i was perhaps the most at risk person of all
9291816 one of my parents sincerely believed that gods care was imminent and i have always respected that this faith was amazing but real the other parent lived in dread of all that could happen but felt it to be an obligation to follow the church line i am afraid that that is the norm in this particular community
9291817 i say that because almost to a man they believe that they will miss out on the grace of god to them god is an austere god whom you had better serve in every way imaginable or else
9291818 just the place for a snark i have said it twice

9291820 the meeting is scheduled to begin this afternoon in jerusalem at the official residence of the prime minister and with the participation of the negotiating team leaders
9291821 the objective remains to press ahead with the process begun at the annapolis conference in the united states last november and to try to conclude a historic israeli palestinian agreement
9291822 these are diversionary tactics to avoid a decision its not a question of negotiating teams its a matter of do you want it or dont you
9291823 they are avoiding the issue they dont want a status of forces agreement they dont want a security agreement
9291824 people gave the impression we were close when rice was here but its not over
9291825 we would have a serious problem if we took it to parliament right now
9291826 yes its confirmed we are going to mississippi in the morning
9291827 they need to know that theyre in our thoughts and prayers as this impending hurricane approaches
9291828 we pray to god that it will spare them and a minimum of loss that might result from this natural disaster
9291829 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a national disaster
9291830 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers
9291831 gustav is forecast to remain a major hurricane through landfall along the northern gulf coast
9291832 ive instructed my senate staff to monitor the situation closely
9291833 you know obviously were going to be each day seeing what happens and were praying for new orleans but we want to make sure that people are making all the necessary precautions
9291834 it is true that we are monitoring the situation of course and there is a chance we can change the schedule but at this time we have not made any changes
9291835 its with great pride and gratitude that i tell you i have found the right partner to help me stand up to those who have corrupted washington

9291844 as a lifelong republican soccer mom living in an affluent community i was impressed with senator obamas acceptance speech last evening having my morning latte with a few of my republican friends i almost spit my coffee when i heard the news is mccain really putting the best interests of our nation first to me he is pandering to women trying to obtain their vote it seems he wants another trophy to parade around with what is wrong with this man
9291845 the fact that absolutely no one in or around her or mccains inner circle had not even the smallest clue this was going to happen shows it was a last minute desperation pick mccain is falling all over himself after the democratic convention and is now grasping at straws
9291846 i think mccains selection of sarah palin as v p very similar to bushs nomination of harriet miers to the supreme court it shows how much a mccain presidency would be just like the bush presidency with the selection of totally unqualified individuals for high government posts weve seen the disastrous results of such picks by bush we can not let mccain continue this saga
9291847 these negative comments about palins inexperience are hilarious shes a whopping three years younger than obama and has about the same amount of experience if shes an irresponsible choice obama as president is even worse since hes at the top of the ticket palin is a great balance for the ticket young smart and has an independent streak a mile wide
9291848 i am a true bill hillary a true blue hillary supporter but i am sure im sure hillary did not mean to put 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that a pro life pro gun homeschooling nobody from the frozen tundra of alaska could slide in
9291849 had i known that being a hockey mom under 45 and having virtually no political experience was the desired v p running mate for mccain i would have asked my wife to throw her hat into the ring mccain has just handed the presidency to barack obama
9291850 cafferty for once and probably the only time i actually agree with you better than i could have said it
9291851 it is a bold move by john mccain to reach out to the eskimo vote which has been totally ignored by the news media
9291852 shes going to learn national security at the foot of the master for the next four years and most doctors think that hell be around at least that long
9291853 the prediction market at intrade doesnt like the palin pick either mccains chances of becoming president have dropped to 39 2 today good news for america

9291932 the image to have in mind is not dan quayle a person with quite a bit of grounding in national issues who was added to the ticket in an attempt to jazz it up always and only the comparison should be with clarence thomas with this one interesting difference thomas was a shrewd choice not simply because his race made it more complicated for democrats to oppose him but also because once confirmed all evidence suggested to conservatives that hed be the kind of justice they were looking for in palins case this seems to be a choice that looks forward to election day and not one day beyond that

9291938 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
9291939 and its just like the democrats to attack them and by implication our entire american way of life and by further extension the very human act of eating and by even further extension life itself and by extensive extension the very concept of existence both for human beings and indeed for the entire universe and perhaps even alternative universes

9291953 there are areas in which people would live their whole lifetime without visiting because its impossible
9291954 the issue of separate roads different registration of cars driven by different nationalities the indignity of producing a permit any time a soldier asks for it and of waiting in long queues in the boiling sun at checkpoints just to enter your own city i think is worse than what we experienced during apartheid
9291955 the daily indignity to which the palestinian population is subjected far outstrips the apartheid regime and the effectiveness with which the bureaucracy implements the repressive measures far exceed that of the apartheid regime
9291956 this is ridiculous why are they arresting our guides and leaving the man with the megaphone
9291957 these provocations didnt come from us im jewish and i look at this and i say to myself how can i feel fear from other jews
9291958 as you walk into yad vashem you see a quote that says in effect you should know a country not only by what it does but what it tolerates
9291959 so i found it very shocking to then come and here and see footage of teenagers heaping abuse on palestinian children as they come out of school and throwing stones at them and that this should be done in the name of judaism i find totally reprehensible
9291960 what the holocaust teaches us more than anything else is that we must never turn our heads away in the face of injustice

9291966 there is much evidence to warrant an in depth investigation of the role played by agents of israel in the 9 11 attacks
9291967 just what level of power do israeli interests wield in the halls of power in the us that any investigation into israeli spying activities on us soil against us intelligence agencies can be so completely quashed
9291968 they were trying to take a current situation and get some training out of it

9291971 on the morning of 9 11 and just as the wtc towers were crumbling the five israelis were caught doing the happy dance as they videotaped the twin towers fall
9291972 either someone does something about these sick psychopaths or they and their kind in washington and around the world will destroy us all
9291973 since 2003 academic unions have been dominated by a campaign to exclude israelis and nobody else from uk campuses we have warned the ucu general secretary on numerous occasions that this campaign has imported anti semitic ways of thinking into our union she either didnt understand or didnt care that the union is now circulating racist material should be understood as a manifestation of its institutional anti semitism it cannot be written off as yet another random accident
9291974 the ucu is circulating links to david dukes website on behalf of delich
9291975 im not surprised that anti semitic material has again dropped into my inbox from the union activists list what is shocking is the failure of the unions internal procedures to do anything about this ucu prides itself on being an anti racist union in fact it is probably the most complacent public institution in britain in relation to increasing anti semitism and the leadership turns a blind eye or worse to the racism in the union behind all this is the campaign of discrimination against israeli academics which is fostered by some in the union and encouraged by the leadership
9291976 this is precisely the kind of thing which drove me recently to resign from the ucu it has become a union which is complacent about anti semitism it regards prejudicial hostility toward jews from within the union itself as something too unimportant for it to bother with i didnt feel able to remain in an institution which treats anti semitism indulgently as a special exception to a generally anti racist stance
9291977 anti semitism is routinely tolerated on the activist list when it is expressed in the language of hostility to israel
9291978 only a small group of jews and anti racists have been standing up against this culture on the list some have been excluded from the list on trumped up charges others have been driven off the list by continual accusations of bad faith some have left the union because they cannot bear to pay their dues to what they consider to be an anti semitic organization
9291979 criticism of israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as anti semitic

9292212 beware of false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves you will recognize them by their fruits are grapes gathered from thornbushes or figs from thistles so every healthy tree bears good fruit but the diseased tree bears bad fruit
9292213 a healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire thus you will recognize them by their fruits

9292216 a healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit
9292217 this factual priority of solitude is i believe a sound element in monastic asceticism locked into interaction with the human beings that make up our fallen world it is all but impossible to grow in grace as one should
9292218 as we have indicated there are many other activities that could for the right person and upon the right occasion be counted as spiritual disciplines in the strict sense stated of our previous chapter the walk with christ certainly is one that leaves room for and even calls for individual creativity and an experimental attitude in such matters
9292219 here it is matter of taking pains about taking pains it is in fact a variety of self obsession narcissism a thing farthest removed from the worship and service of god
9292220 willard teeters on the edge of openness theology but he doesnt go as far as many openness adherents
9292221 didnt think it made sense that you got saved and were stuck with it
9292222 by this willard means there must be more than just waiting for heaven but even so this is not exactly the most gracious thing one could say to his creator for a gift none of us could ever deserve

9292225 if you stay in the churches the university will be closed to you but if you stay in the university the churches will be open to you
9292226 jesus and his teachings and the philosophers and their teachings were addressing the same questions
9292227 generally what i find is that the ordinary people who come to church are basically running their lives on their own utilizing the arm of the flesh their natural abilities to negotiate their own way
9292228 they believe there is a god and they need to check in with him but they dont have any sense that he is an active agent in their lives as a result they dont become disciples of jesus
9292229 they consume his merits and the services of the church discipleship is no essential part of christianity today
9292230 we dont preach life in the kingdom of god through faith in jesus as an existential reality that leads to discipleship and then character transformation

9292238 barth spoke of the bible becoming rather than being the word of god

9292244 rendition as currently practiced is undermining our moral credibility and standing abroad and weakening the coalitions with foreign governments that we need to effectively combat international terrorism
9292245 in many cases of extraordinary rendition it appears that the seized persons are expressly delivered to foreign jurisdictions to circumvent constitutional rights
9292246 they are rendered in a manner to specifically deprive them of due process and civil liberties protections
9292247 when the cia delivered talaat fouad qassem to the egyptian authorities it was certainly aware of how he would be treated
9292248 at a minimum countries with indisputably lousy human rights records say syria were off limits
9292249 now though the bush team seems to have dramatically eroded such safeguards
9292250 the administrations avowed aim was to allow the transfer of suspects to jurisdictions with laxer constraints on coercive interrogation
9292251 torture thus became a primary goal not merely a collateral consequence of rendition to third countries in this respect the post 9 11 extraordinary rendition system is qualitatively different from the rendition programs that preceded it
9292252 we do not transport anyone to a country if we believe it more likely than not that the individual will be tortured
9292253 we dont kick the expletive out of them we send them to other countries so they can kick the expletive out of them
9292254 the cable was a black electrical cable about two inches thick they hit me with it everywhere on my body they mostly aimed for my palms but sometimes missed and hit my wrists they were sore and red for three weeks they also struck me on my hips and lower back i could hear other prisoners being tortured and screaming and screaming
9292255 it might be better sometimes for suspects to remain in the hands of foreign authorities who might be able to use more aggressive interrogation techniques
9292256 were operating through sort of you know a dark side
9292257 torture is used to extract information detainees are frequently stripped to their underwear hung by their wrists with their feet touching the floor or forced to stand for prolonged periods doused with hot and cold water beaten forced to stand outdoors in cold weather and subjected to electric shocks
9292258 local human rights organizations have cited numerous cases of security forces allegedly abusing and torturing prisoners torture and abuse of detainees was also reportedly common many instances of abuse went unreported
9292259 to arrest people and send them back to their country of origin with the promise that they wont be tortured thats the promise we receive
9292260 torture is never acceptable nor do we hand over people to countries that do torture
9292261 to countries where we believe or we know theyre going to be tortured
9292262 the united states does not permit tolerate or condone torture under any circumstances the united states does not transport and has not transported detainees from one country to another for the purpose of interrogation using torture the united states has not transported anyone and will not transport anyone to a country when we believe he will be tortured
9292263 u s officials may seek to transfer suspects from a western ally to the middle east because the western allys laws or inclinations prevent the close monitoring or aggressive interrogation of a terrorism suspect in contrast to many middle eastern countries with poor human rights records many u s allies in the middle east have a far lower standard of evidence and are willing to bend what rules they have in response to a u s request some middle eastern countries can also persuade or coerce a suspects relatives
9292264 they say they are not abusing them and that satisfies the legal requirement but we all know they do
9292265 under the convention against torture and farra 1998 foreign affairs reform and restructuring act we are obligated not to send someone to a country where they will be tortured so we use these diplomatic assurances to hopefully constrain the actions of the country to which the individual is sent the arar case demonstrates the dangerous practice of relying on these diplomatic assurances
9292266 such stories hurt americas standing in the eyes of its allies and erode support for u s counterterrorism efforts
9292267 weakened ties to friendly governments are felt later when they refuse to send troops to iraq resist trade overtures or otherwise demonstrate their displeasure
9292268 violates numerous international human rights standards including the universal declaration of human rights the international covenant on civil and political rights the international covenant on economic social and cultural rights the convention and protocol relating to the status of refugees the convention against torture the vienna convention on consular relations and the geneva conventions
9292269 take into account all relevant considerations including where applicable the existence in the state concerned of a consistent pattern of gross flagrant or mass violations of human rights
9292270 it shall be the policy of the united states not to expel extradite or otherwise affect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture
9292271 the practice of transferring an individual to a foreign state in circumstances that make it more likely than not that the individual will be subjected to torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment
9292272 u s commitments under article 3 of the convention against torture and our related policy are absolute there are no exceptions based on national security or the criminality of an individual
9292273 we reject extraordinary rendition for torture related purposes we reject secret detention centres we categorically reject torture and we refuse to overlook the occurrence of such activities on british territory anywhere britain is committed to investigating the circumstances surrounding these two incidents and to following up on any leads or suspicions related to other similar incidents
9292274 egyptian american cooperation in extraordinary rendition strengthens the least law abiding elements of the egyptian state its internal security forces and thus corrodes the prospects for full egyptian democracy
9292275 those who live in a glass house should not throw stones america has a lot of dirt on its hands
9292276 in our long term effort to stem the tide of international terrorism our commitments to the rule of law and to individual rights and civil liberties are among our most formidable weapons the controversial aspects of the united states governments use of rendition have been used by propagandists and recruiters to fuel and sustain international terrorist organizations with a constant stream of new recruits
9292277 offer an example of moral leadership in the world committed to treat people humanely abide by the rule of law and be generous and caring to our neighbors
9292278 very tainted you could bet on the testimony given to you it was altered in a way that would serve the interests of the country that was giving it it would be far from coupled with what was actually being said
9292279 to build a better freer world we must first behave in ways that reflect the decency and aspirations of the american people this means ending the practice of shipping away prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far off countries of detaining thousands without charge or trial of maintaining a network of secret prisons to jail people beyond the reach of law
9292280 let me personally give you what our government has not an apology
9292281 congress has a role here in ensuring that our laws our values are respected by any administration this congress unfortunately has abdicated its oversight responsibility a failure which these hearings will begin to correct but while congress took no action others stepped up to the plate much of what we know about the renditions program is known because of the important work of news agencies and nongovernmental organizations in january the european parliament made an important contribution to the debate by issuing a report on what the cia was doing in europe and on their own governments apparent complicity in its operations
9292282 these kidnappings and subsequent tortures have done much to discredit the united states in countries from which the suspects were taken and they have interfered with our intelligence gathering from officials there who are now accused of complicity with american disregard of the laws of those sovereign nations
9292283 extraordinary rendition evolved out of pre 9 11 practices intended to facilitate judicial processes only after 9 11 did it become a purposive way to evade u s legal prohibitions against torture
9292284 we really dont have the resources to rescue you after this
9292285 i have a dream where little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands
9292286 provide every gamer with a case that they can identify with
9292287 acknowledge again and explicitly that this nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations who have already proclaimed themselves at war with us and who are dedicated to the slaughter of americans
9292288 this seems like a final push by the administration before they go out the door
9292289 we have been at war with an unconventional enemy whose primary goal is to kill innocent americans
9292290 is trying to stir up again the politics of fear by reminding people of something they havent really forgotten that we are engaged in serious armed conflict with al qaeda
9292291 but the question is where is that conflict to be waged and by what means
9292292 as sept 11 2001 recedes into the past there are some people who have come to think of it as kind of a singular event and of there being nothing else out there
9292293 in a way we are the victims of our own success our own success being that another attack has been prevented
9292294 reaffirm that for the duration of the conflict the united states may detain as enemy combatants those who have engaged in hostilities or purposefully supported al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations
9292295 i dont want to face another situation where we had the sept 14 resolution and then attorney general gonzales claimed that that was authorization to violate fisa
9292296 i do not believe that we are in a state of war whatsoever
9292297 we have an odious opponent that the criminal justice system is able to identify and indict and convict theyre not a goliath dont treat them that way
9292298 carries significant legal and public policy implications for mr bush
9292299 but mr bush and his advisers say that seven years without an attack has lulled many americans
9292300 with violence rising in afghanistan and osama bin laden still at large there are ample signs of the united states continued battles with terrorism but mr bush and his advisers say that seven years without an attack has lulled many americans
9292301 gee why dont we just forget about using armies for this problem and devote the resources to health care education amp infrastructure instead
9292302 there has never been a protracted war from which a country has benefited

9292317 in the 1930s woolworths five and dime was the equivalent of
9292318 there was a whole movement in the 1930s against chain stores
9292319 they were called the chain store evil because waitresses at woolworths staged an eight day sitdown strike in 1937 singing dancing exercising doing each others hair and nails until finally management recognized their union and gave them a five cent per hour pay hike
9292320 young girls blonde brunette slim plump going on strike for their rights
9292321 yet that story has been buried in the way that labor struggles in general have been omitted or given brief mention in most mainstream accounts of the history of the united states
9292322 it deserves to be recalled because embedded in the events of

9292336 dude who do you think god made sex for us older married folks or you

9292345 i believe that churches which are built on fun and relationships are part of the reason christianity is deemed irrelevant by all too many in our culture frankly if i want to have fun id rather go play a round of golf if i want to be entertained with music ill listen to my ipod or go to a concert if i want to build relationships kynette and i will invite someone for dinner i do not go to church on sunday mornings for fun or entertainment or to build relationships i go to worship god with fellow believers

9292348 im ok without children and besides children are a drain on the worlds resources
9292349 but what this clip has done is convince me that a shrinking population is good that one woman as good as said that we need to increase the numbers of our younger generations so we can enslave them to the well being of the elders why dont the elders look after their own well being
9292350 its not him its something that he triggers in you get over thinking its about him
9292351 a man may deal with theory and miss the whole impact of the truth
9292352 being governor of a small state for less than two years is not consistent with the normal criteria for determining whos of presidential caliber
9292353 i think she is the most inexperienced person on a major party ticket in modern history
9292354 it would be one thing if she had only been governor for a year and a half but prior to that she had not had major experience in public life
9292355 the fact that he would have to go to somebody who is clearly unqualified to be president makes obama look like an elder statesman
9292356 not to belittle alaska but its different than the basket of issues you deal with in big dynamic states
9292357 governor you cant say this but we can she is a cancer and she is nothing but a very jealous woman
9292358 well im going to say what i wish you could say lyda green is a bitch and she needs to go away because she is a cancer on the progress of the state of alaska

9292360 in our time all greece was visited b a dearth of children and general decay of population this evil grew upon us rapidly and without attracting attention by our men becoming perverted to a passion for show and money and the pleasures of an idle life
9292361 we liberate slaves chiefly for the purpose of making out of them as many citizens as possible we give our allies a share in the government that our numbers may increase yet you romans of the original stock including quintii valerii iulli are eager that your families and names at once shall perish with you
9292362 the ultimate objective of all these conspiracy theories is a territorial break up and dismemberment of the country

9292371 the part i like about tennis is that you work the hardest and you can choose to get better and you can mold yourself into a champion
9292372 i really believe that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians the aclu people for the american way all of them who have tried to secularize america i point the finger in their face and say you helped this terrorist attack happen
9292373 feminism is a socialist anti family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands kill their children practice witchcraft destroy capitalism and become lesbians
9292374 gov palin is a conservative republican with a track record of reforming government she will strengthen sen mccains appeal to reagan democrats and supporters of senator hillary clinton who are looking for a president who has the experience and temperament to be commander in chief i look forward to seeing sen mccain and gov palin in the white house in 2009
9292375 as a female public servant i have always tried to stay away from gender politics because of my desire to focus on getting the job done for the people but i believe that in order to make government work better it must include both strong men and women with this historic choice senator mccain has clearly shown his and the republican partys commitment to including every voice in our society if the american people are truly seeking change and reform their only choice in this race is the mccain palin ticket
9292376 im disappointed and surprised but we have to move forward
9292377 my disappointment will subside in 24 hours and then ill be 150 committed to mccain
9292378 im hoping to hear a lot about alternative energy sources because a lot of those jobs could come to michigan

9292383 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9292384 to just have it planned at the same time that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river
9292385 this is not a time to panic but is a time to get prepared
9292386 no government can take care of every need of every family or every business all the time

9292388 it used to be very common but it is getting less and less so
9292389 were pleased that missouri voters have shown strong support for our measure
9292390 the schools first initiative provides vitally needed new funds to missouri schools by increasing the state taxes paid by casinos it prohibits the legislature from using the casino taxes dedicated to education for any other purpose it also protects thousands of local jobs and our state economy by ensuring that missouri casinos can compete for visitors on an equal basis with casinos in neighboring states
9292391 i have received no emergency preparedness training i do not know cpr or the heimlich maneuver and i do not have a cell phone i do not acknowledge the right of the administration to place any item on my syllabus and i do not appreciate their attempt to shift their legal liability on to me with this cover their ass policy
9292392 the impact of the falling value of the dollar on composition valuations did play a factor in dragging down the dollars share of fx reserves versus the euro
9292393 the rise in the euros weighting in q1 mostly reflected the fact that the euro appreciated sharply in that quarter hence raising the value in dollar terms of existing euro assets
9292394 i have been thinking that i would make a proposition to my republican friends that if they will stop telling lies about the democrats we will stop telling the truth about them
9292395 there will be five million new jobs created in the next ten years because we are running out of cheap resources many of you will lose your jobs in my first term but through some training and hardship and moving some where new you will have a job again
9292396 offended the religious feelings of many people who consider the cross a symbol of gods love and of our redemption
9292397 i have been thinking that i would make a proposition to my republican friends that if they will stop telling lies about the democrats we will stop telling the truth about them
9292398 if thats the face of experience i think its going to scare away a lot of those independent voters that are on the fence
9292399 its the tears she pretended to cry the women felt sorry for her and she won
9292400 the fact there is not 100 consensus that peter should be bdfl means that he isnt one such roles arise from community consensus not from the founder declaring they are the bdfl
9292401 sometimes the first duty of intelligent men is the restatement of the obvious
9292402 in a series of e mails i patiently explained that bush couldnt be hitler since hitler was dead
9292403 when my grandfather left europe in 1937 the graffiti on the walls read jews go to palestine today the graffiti reads jews out of palestine how soon europe forgets
9292404 in view of the deteriorating humanitarian situation and the media blackout of the events in kashmir we call upon the international humanitarian agencies particularly the united nations bodies and the world press to intervene immediately to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in kashmir
9292405 owing to the strict curfew hundreds of the injured lying in various hospitals of kashmir are not able to get critical medicines and the attendants are without food the sick and the injured are not able to reach hospitals resulting in deaths attendants of dozens of dead in various hospitals in kashmir are awaiting transport for the final rites
9292406 the flow of information has completely stopped for the first time in the history of kashmir and no newspaper has been able to publish in last 3 days
9292407 such communications blockade is resulting in loss of news about the unfolding events blackout of significant happenings in kashmirs countryside where currently media has no access and which is tightly controlled by the army we call upon the international community to call upon the government of india to lift the communications blockade without any delay
9292408 in view of the four days of stringent restrictions on peoples movement and heavy clampdown by the state forces across the 10 districts of kashmir including srinagar city we appeal the international community to ask the government of india to immediately ease curfew restrictions so that people are able to access basic essentials
9292409 penetrated at least six miles inland in many portions of coastal mississippi and up to 12 miles inland along bays and rivers the surge crossed interstate 10 in many locations
9292410 water never came down there before katrina thats across the track with katrina that water came in and that water went out and the velocity was unbelievable
9292411 the first boundary was the beach and the next boundary was the highway the day after the storm you saw neither no beach and no highway
9292412 i am strongly strongly encouraging everyone in the city to evacuate
9292413 start the process now go north if you can because the storm may continue to turn a little bit west
9292414 id rather play it safe than sorry because i know what sorry feels like
9292415 if youve been through katrina its time for you to go
9292416 you never know about these storms if youve been living in the city 80 years
9292417 my sense from talking to citizens is that they are either in an extreme state of anxious to leave or theyre just tired and i dont want to be bothered
9292418 if its like katrina they might not let us back
9292419 they might put a fence around the whole parish and say go away
9292420 we have not made a decision for any sort of mass evacuations
9292421 were trying not to pull the trigger too quickly on evacuations
9292422 there may be some shifting in the direction of the storm
9292423 thank god for the posts of lonesome traveler otherwise this whole blog would be nothing but tr whining about losing the cards ive become an angels fan thanks to the affiliation and have not cared about the cards in years
9292424 gustav roared over cubas isle of youth at 2 pm today and is now clobbering the western tip of cuba with 145 mph cat 4 winds and a storm surge estimated at 18 23 feet this will be a massive disaster for cuba as portions of the stretch of coast to the right of where gustav will make landfall are heavily populated figure 2 furthermore gustavs hurricane force winds extend out 60 miles from the eye meaning that the western reaches of the capital city of havana will receive a formidable blow havanas construction is fairly dilapidated and category 1 hurricane winds will do heavy damage adding to the catastrophe will be rainfall amounts of up to 25 inches causing dangerous fresh water flooding gustav is likely to be one of the five most damaging hurricanes in cuban history fortunately cuba has a top notch hurricane civil defense operation and im confident they have gotten all of the population at risk out of harms way
9292425 it has the potential to impact every area of this metropolitan area
9292426 this is worse than a betsy worse than a katrina
9292427 if he means the area of most severe impact its not a fair comparison at this point
9292428 its not possible to calculate the area of most severe impact at this moment
9292429 you need to be scared and you need to get your butts out of new orleans right now
9292430 john mccain should ask obama to join him in a town meeting on lessons from russias aggression both candidates favor nato membership for georgia and ukraine perhaps vladimir putins next victim but does russias behavior cause obama to rethink reliance on soft power dialogue disapproval diplomacy economic carrots and sticks which putin considers almost an oxymoron does russias resort to military coercion and its arsenal of intercontinental ballistic missiles cause obama to revise his resistance to missile defense obama unlike mccain believes russia belongs in the g 8 does obama think russia should be admitted to the world trade organization does obama consider putin helpful regarding iran mccain must convince voters that obamas complacent confidence in the taming abilities of soft power is the effect of liberalisms scary sentimentalism about a dangerous thing human nature and a fiction the community of nations mccain is hardly the change many people have been eagerly waiting for but putin is part of the change we must confront until russian tanks rolled into georgia it seemed that not even the democratic party could lose this election but it might if mccain can make it turn on the question of who is ornery enough to give putin a convincing deterring telephone call at 3 a m
9292431 whatever the political outcome of russias invasion of georgia the incident has reminded american voters that in uncertain times it is dangerous to choose a rookie with no foreign policy experience and a juvenile approach to world affairs over one tempered by war who understands that u n resolutions might as well be written in disappearing ink john mccain knows that peace through strength is what defeated the soviet union and that its peace through strength that will best preserve free nations and advance their interests
9292432 our military strength is a prerequisite to peace but let it be clear we maintain this strength in the hope it will never be used for the ultimate determinant in the struggle thats now going on in the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish the ideals to which we are dedicated
9292433 the prevailing wisdom 18 months or so ago was that invading iraq had been in retrospect a disastrous blunder it had led to appalling sectarian fratricide and an ever climbing body count iraqi democracy was deemed a naive pipe dream worst of all it was said the fighting in iraq wasnt advancing the global struggle against islamist terrorism by rallying a new generation of jihadists it was actually impeding it opponents of the war clamored loudly for pulling the plug but what if we had known then what we know now we know now that the overhauled counterinsurgency strategy devised by general david petraeus the surge would prove spectacularly successful driving al qaeda in iraq from its strongholds and killing thousands of its fighters supporters and leaders we know now that us losses in iraq would plummet to the lowest levels of the war with just five americans killed in combat in july 2008 compared with 66 fatalities in the same month a year ago and with 137 in november 2004 we know now that the sectarian bloodletting would be dramatically reduced with numerous sunni tribal leaders abandoning their former al qaeda allies and shiite radical moqtada mahdi army being thoroughly routed by the iraqi military we know now that by the summer of 2008 the iraqi government would meet all but three of the 18 benchmarks set by congress to demonstrate security economic progress and political reconciliation and we know now that far from being undermined by the campaign in iraq the wider war against islamist violence would show significant progress with terrorism outside iraqs borders having in fact gone way down over the past five years as newsweeks fareed zakaria noted in may and with popular support for jihadist organizations plummeting across the muslim world so what does hindsight counsel today that iraq is a pointless quagmire or that it is a costly but winnable war in which patience tenacity and smarts have a good chance of succeeding
9292434 the reaction of the american left to john edwardss sex scandal is nothing short of flabbergasting since when is sex outside of marriage a disqualifier for merely speaking at a political convention since when is having sexual relations with that woman in your office anything wrong since when do we judge the difference here seems to be that elizabeth edwards has cancer so only fatal disease makes the bonds of marriage sacred although the last thing i want to look to be doing is making excuses for adultery what he did was wrong the john edwards incident begs americans to look in the mirror if we think what john edwards did with rielle hunter is wrong why do we think its wrong because marriage is at the foundation of our society and we should do what we can to protect every last one or simply because having fun while your wife is fighting a fatal disease is a lousy thing to do i dont know how we can condemn john edwards when americans have been known to cheer for cheaters in movies watch celebs do it all the time as a form of perverse entertainment and even insist were not sure what exactly marriage means
9292435 senator obama has also said many times that he is against special interests but like most politicians who say that he means that he is against other politicians special interests his own special interests are never called special interests neither are the environmental extremists who support the democrats called special interests but the green zealots who have for decades blocked the country from using oil within our own borders more oil than in saudi arabia by the way are also among the special interests with a big voice in the democratic party they are also a major factor in shutting down the democratic voting process in this case in the house of representatives where speaker nancy pelosi refuses to allow a vote on drilling for oil in places where the green zealots dont want drilling the congressional democrats could of course vote to continue forbidding drilling in those places but voters paying 4 a gallon for gas are not likely to agree with the green zealots and recent polls show that they do not rather than lose votes in the november elections by voting with the green zealots or lose the money that the green zealots contribute to the democratic party coffers nancy pelosi simply shut down the house of representatives so that there could be no votes and turned off the lights so that c span could not broadcast republicans speeches protesting what happened after all what is democracy compared to support from the green zealots
9292436 i must confess that i am spending an awful lot of time thinking about barack obama i hasten to add that its not as is the case with chris matthews because the senator sends shivers up my leg rather its because i simply cant figure out how hes managed to convince so many people that he should be the president of the united states to be perfectly honest i invariably feel that way about the candidates the democrats try to foist off on us but as a rule guys like dukakis gore and kerry are just typical party hacks but at least none of them attended a racist church they didnt associate with known terrorists and they usually didnt display their contempt for national symbols and the u s military quite so blatantly liberals have tried to convince me that obama is brilliant i find that odd because he has said that there are 57 states that jfk got the russians to remove their missiles from cuba by sitting down and chatting with khrushchev and that iran doesnt really constitute an actual threat because they dont spend as much money on weaponry as we do funny but brilliant isnt the first word that comes to mind but what do liberals know they were also convinced that jimmy carter was intelligent
9292437 nothing is more essential to the establishment of manners in a state than that all persons employed in places of power and trust must be men of unexceptionable characters
9292438 the principle of government control over information is inseparable from the principle of government control over peoples lives
9292439 nothing doth more hurt in a state than that cunning men pass for wise
9292440 when asked what americas greatest moral failing was theological obama said it was our collective failure to abide by that basic precept in the book of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me for obama the politician such scriptural quotations often serve as an all inclusive writ to impose his religious views on others when it comes to fighting poverty global warming racism etc but when the question turns to abortion political obama insists on a policy of moral agnosticism and political laissez faire
9292441 obama is the only elected official on record to ever vote in favor of denying life saving medical care to children who had been born but that were struggling for life is that a decision too confusing so as to be above the pay grade as well
9292442 it is now clear why barack obama has refused john mccains offer of joint town hall appearances during the fall campaign mccain is obviously better at them
9292443 candidly talking about racial issues doesnt make you a racist any more than being aware of gender differences makes you a sexist
9292444 the overwhelming votes for obama in some virtually all white states show that many americans are ready to move beyond race but obama himself wants to have it both ways by attributing racist notions to the mccain camp that has never made race an issue the problem with clever people is that they dont know when to stop being clever and senator obama is a very clever man perhaps too clever by half as the british say
9292445 police in denver are getting ready for the democratic convention theyre ordering the stun guns the barbed wire the plastic handcuffs and thats just for bill clintons room
9292446 nancy pelosi threatened to strip joe lieberman of his homeland security chairmanship if he doesnt stop criticizing barack obama shes in the house and hes in the senate the only power nancy pelosi has to strip joe lieberman is if she decides to moonlight as an airport screener and he comes through her checkpoint
9292447 i could care less about the color of barack obamas skin but the thinness of it is starting to wear on me
9292448 mr obama has a deep rich voice coming from his mouth nonsense sounds good but its still nonsense
9292449 let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party generally
9292450 there are two other issues with which mr obama must grapple and far from helping with any of these mr biden actually makes mr obamas path more difficult the first is that mr obamas other big challenge is convincing moderate americans he shares their values he is already seen by many as a liberal big city politician who says people cling to guns and religion out of bitterness associates with radicals and attended a church with a radical theology mr biden is a fierce foe of gun rights ardently opposes restrictions on abortion that have widespread support and promotes gay rights he supports higher taxes bigger government and socialized healthcare that doesnt exactly help mr obama with blue collar voters in ohio pennsylvania and michigan the second is mr bidens lack of executive experience not only has he never been a governor or a cabinet secretary he has never been a mayor an agency head or served in any other executive role not even prosecutor or military officer given that mr obama also lacks that experience having two career legislators heading the executive branch of our government might create doubts more broadly it cuts against mr obamas central campaign theme of change his message is washington is broken and the old establishment needs to be swept away in favor of new blood and a new vision how does picking someone who has been in washington a decade longer than mr mccain jive with mr obamas contention that mr mccain has been in washington too long to change it
9292451 alas the abandonment of babies to suffer and die on the modern equivalent of a spartan cliff did not require confronting evil when obama saw it indeed obama turned a blind eye leading the battle to defeat illinois version of the federal born alive infants protection act which would have treated babies living albeit briefly outside the womb as well babies he opposed the bill in 2003 as he had a similar one in 2001 saying it would undermine roe v wade but even after roe neutral language was included wording good enough that it won support for the federal version of the bill from abortion rights stalwart sen barbara boxer obama remained unmoved until this week obama denied that he ever took such a position his campaign now admits that he was in effect lying when he said pro lifers were lying about his record but simultaneously obama defends a position that comes dismayingly close to the laymans understanding of infanticide while claiming any other position would require him to play god
9292452 i still think a one term pledge could win it for john mccain because it would allow america to punt it would make the 2008 choice seem less fateful people dont mind the chance to defer a choice when theyre not at all sure about the product more it would allow mr mccain to say he means to face the tough problems ahead with a uniquely bipartisan attitude and without having to care a fig for re election that itself would give him a new power one that would make up for the lost juice of lame duckdom it would also serve to separate him from the hyperpolitical operating styles of the clinton bush years from the constant campaign and mr mccain would still have what he always wanted the presidency perhaps a serious and respectable one that accrued special respect because it involved some sacrifice on his part a move that would help him win doubtful voters win disaffected democrats allow some republicans to not have to get drunk to vote for him and that could possibly yield real results for his country this seems to me such a potentially electrifying idea that hed likely walk out of his convention as the future president mr mccain told politico on wednesday that hes not considering a one term pledge why would he not such modesty of intent is at odds with the political personality the thing that makes them want to rule america is the thing that stops them from thinking of prudent limits this mindset crosses all political categories
9292453 we the members of the new republican party believe that the preservation and enhancement of the values that strengthen and protect individual freedom family life communities and neighborhoods and the liberty of our beloved nation should be at the heart of any legislative or political program presented to the american people
9292454 the 110th congress whose term officially ends in january hasnt attacked high gasoline prices but it has used its powers to celebrate watermelons and to decree the origins of the word baseball barring a burst of legislative activity after labor day this group of 535 men and women will have accomplished a rare feat in two decades of record keeping no sitting congress has passed fewer public laws at this point in the session 294 so far than this one thats not to say theyve been idle on the flip side no congress in the same 20 years has been so prolific when it comes to proposing resolutions more than 1 900 according to a tally by the nonpartisan taxpayers for common sense with the mostly symbolic measures congress has saluted such milestones as the idaho potato commissions 70th anniversary and recognized soil as an essential natural resource as legislation on gasoline prices tax fixes and predatory lending languish congress has designated may 5 9 as national substitute teacher recognition week and set july 28 as the day of the american cowboy the resolutions which generally dont carry the force of law can originate in either the house or senate however some types of resolutions establish the federal budget authorize the president to go to war or condemn actions such as the genocide in darfur even among the 294 laws passed thus far many were symbolic in nature many of the post offices named by this congress honor servicemen and women killed in iraq and afghanistan in the 435 member house fully one quarter of the workweek is typically devoted to debating and passing symbolic measures
9292455 the latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man
9292456 in selecting sen joseph biden as his running mate barack obama gains some needed foreign policy expertise but loses some credibility if washington is as bad as these two say it is was biden a contributor or an enabler during his six senate terms if 36 years in the senate doesnt make you an insider and part of the problem what does
9292457 when obama the most liberal member of the u s senate according to the 2007 vote scoring done by national journal picks the third most liberal senator does that count as reaching across the aisle
9292458 joe biden wasnt even on barack obamas short list until august 7 when russia suddenly invaded the neighboring country of georgia thats the word from key democrats meeting here in denver who say the obama campaigns need to shore up its foreign policy bona fides helped push the delaware senator to the top of the pack we didnt pick our nominee vladimir putin did is how one democrat who professes to be pleased with the biden choice put it
9292459 just what changes the old democratic order when you have bill clinton speaking one night and hillary clinton the next night
9292460 w hat does one call a lawmaker who would condemn to death the child survivor of a botched abortion by permitting doctors to refuse that child once born alive potentially life saving medical treatment and nutrition a number of things come to mind mr president isnt one of them
9292461 you know why they call it birth control because its meant to stop a birth from happening nine months later we know when life begins everyone who ever bought a pack of condom knows when life begins to put it another way with conception something begins what do you think it is a car a 1948 buick
9292462 the timid civilized world has found nothing with which to oppose the onslaught of a sudden revival of barefaced barbarity other than concessions and smiles
9292463 if you see a man approaching you with the obvious intent of doing you good you should run for your life
9292464 if liberty means anything at all it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
9292465 a sure sign of a genius is that all of the dunces are in a confederacy against him
9292466 i would like to take you seriously but to do so would affront your intelligence
9292467 senator joseph biden has been anointed by the chosen one to be his running mate for vice president that locks down the important swing state of delaware and puts the combined fatuous egotism of the ticket into overload territory
9292468 barack obama is finally ready for the dreaded 3 a m telephone call now he can answer it and hand the phone to joe biden joe starts talking and figures hell eventually think of something to say sometimes he does and often wishes he hadnt
9292469 obama wanted to gave himself a boost riding into denver but his shot in the arm only put a bullet in his foot obama biden these guys are gonna be more laughs than tom and jerry
9292470 barack obama has made his economic thinking excruciatingly clear so it also is clear that his running mate should have been not joe biden but rumpelstiltskin he spun straw into gold a skill an obama administration will need to fulfill its fairy tale promises
9292471 thousands of my potential children died on your daughters face last night
9292472 with all due respect to gov kaine hes been a governor for three years
9292473 kaine was mayor of the 105th largest city in america and again with all due respect to richmond virginia its smaller than chula vista california aurora colorado mesa or gilbert arizona north las vegas or henderson nevada its not a big town
9292474 and be not fashioned after this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind
9292475 for it has no durability or fixedness but all in it is but for a season and so he calls it this age hereby to indicate its liableness to misfortune and by the word fashion its unsubstantialness
9292476 to show that the worlds ways are a fashion but virtues not a fashion but a kind of real form with a natural beauty of its own lacking not the trickeries and fashions of outward things which no sooner appear than they go to nought

9292478 ketchikan desires a better way to reach the airport but the 398 million bridge is not the answer
9292479 despite the work of our congressional delegation we are about 329 million short of full funding for the bridge project and its clear that congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between ketchikan and gravina island
9292480 much of the publics attitude toward alaska bridges is based on inaccurate portrayals of the projects here
9292481 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century
9292482 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day
9292483 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9292484 to have it planned at the same time i mean yes it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention

9292488 mr obamas speech a historic one given his status as the first african american nominee of a major political party reached significantly more viewers than the comparable addresses in 2004
9292489 coverage of john kerrys acceptance speech in 2004 had 24 4 million viewers coverage of george w bushs convention speech that same year drew 27 5 million
9292490 well when ones lost i suppose its good advice to stay where you are until someone finds you but whod ever think to look for me here

9292511 you have a cockswinging irreverence for academic formality yet backed up your topic with solid analytical methodology
9292512 way to go pidge for highlighting such a riproaring exchange of opinion
9292513 i couldnt stop where you told us to mrs d

9292518 ik heb haar gevraagd in brazili we waren er op vakantie en zaten op de rotsen in zee ook toen keken we naar de zonsondergang het voelde perfect ik heb vaker langere relaties gehad maar opeens wist ik dat mirjam de ware is en dat ik met haar wilde trouwen mirjam is in tarzan gorillavrouwtje maar dit is geen apeliefde maar echte liefde we wonen al een jaar samen
9292519 ik stelde de vraag maar ze nam me eerst niet serieus toen eindelijk doordrong dat ik het meende straalde ze meer dan de sterren in brazili daarna heeft ze haar moeder gebeld
9292520 as for that vp talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day
9292521 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9292522 at this juncture we are moving ahead with the planning of our convention and there have been no changes to our schedule of events we obviously share the concerns of many americans as we watch the developments
9292523 the buying power behind the u s gay lesbian and bisexual adult population is projected to be 610 billion strong in 2005 according to witeck combs communications a market research company based in washington that number is up from 580 billion in 2004
9292524 in comparison the disposable income of hispanic americans both gay and straight was 686 billion last year
9292525 just as dawn breaks there is a pink glow over the horizon
9292526 that pink is a sign of hope a gift from god
9292527 a gift of hope a gift of a new day
9292528 this is the day im going to get it right diet love live work save clean
9292529 for some people having a fry up with bacon and sausages might seem like a good way to start the day but if you are doing this regularly then you are significantly increasing your risk of bowel cancer
9292530 red meat is an important part of a healthy diet because it contains valuable nutrients its the processed stuff you need to be careful of
9292531 this government has been caught out deliberately fudging the true number of public hospital beds by changing the definition of bed
9292532 number of available bed and available bed alternatives for public acute hospitals
9292533 queensland health data dictionary defines an available bed as a bed which is immediately available to be used by an admitted patient if required and an available bed alternative as an item of furniture for example trolley and cot non recognised beds occupied or not which is immediately available for use by admitted patients
9292534 number of items of furniture eg trolleys chairs cots non recognised beds etc
9292535 i dont think the thousands of people coming into our major hospitals every day for renal dialysis or chemotherapy would agree with that
9292536 we must act urgently to improve our childrens performance in maths and encourage those with aptitude to go on to study it
9292537 literacy and numeracy in the primary years are crucially important to ensuring all students participate in education and make a positive transition to work and learning in adult life
9292538 students who do not achieve the minimum standards in literacy and numeracy are least likely to stay on through secondary school or to end up in further study and employment
9292539 how could we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9292540 i dont know why some people have children at all if they know that they can only take a few weeks off work
9292541 i know you want a child and you have every right to want a child but does the child want you if you are going to put it in childcare at six weeks
9292542 i dont think the child wants you to tell the honest truth i know thats incredibly controversial
9292543 were going to look back on this time from the late 90s onwards with putting children in childcare so early in their first year of life for such long hours and wonder how we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9292544 its just awful its awful for the mothers as well its completely heartbreaking

9292587 a markneukirchen violin from 1950 may sound a mint better than that 1700s testore
9292588 we also have to be concerned about future generations of americans
9292589 were going to end up with the highest deficit probably in the history of this country
9292590 if i remember correctly you were trying really really hard to be douglas adams
9292591 in fact i wanted to be john cleese and it took some time to realize the job was in fact taken
9292592 she is getting older and although i am certain that governor sarah palin is above such things mccain may not be above an affair of the heart how else can you explain meeting someone one time before asking them to step into the most powerful position in the world should your aged heart stop beating his first wife was a beauty queen until tragedy struck her then he replaced her while still married with the then young heiress cindy mccain there is never a public display of sincere affection between these two you could not wipe the ebullient smile off of mccains face as the pretty governor palin stood at his side
9292593 laughed at the suggestion and certainly did not call mccain on it
9292594 im going to give you some straight talk my friends
9292595 i couldve gone the easy route i couldve reached across the aisle and compromised and accepted joe lieberman as my running mate but a republican president deserves a republican vice president so i made the hard choice and chose the presidencys about making hard choices my friends
9292596 im still pro life and im still in favour of marriage as being between one man and one woman and i would like the next president who will select justices for the next supreme court to agree
9292597 help churches find ways to help christians get to the polls
9292598 there was a tier one candidate that stood for our goals of life and marriage that man was gov mike huckabee
9292599 mollify a coy capricious or irascible deity by the soft insinuation of prayer and sacrifice
9292600 isnt it amazing what a determined mother can accomplish with a baby in her arms or in a sling
9292601 no i sit on the couch and eat bon bons all day while my servants do all the work
9292602 freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction we didnt pass it to our children in the bloodstream it must be fought for protected and handed on for them to do the same or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our childrens children what it was once like in the united states where men were free
9292603 children should be educated and instructed in the principles of freedom
9292604 that the said constitution be never construed to authorize congress to infringe the just liberty of the press or the rights of conscience or to prevent the people of the united states from keeping their own arms
9292605 before a standing army can rule the people must be disarmed as they are in almost every kingdom in europe the supreme power in america cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a superior force to any band of regular troops that can be on any pretense raised in the united states

9292608 i think you guys can take a look at governor palins record and joe bidens record and make your own judgments in terms of who you think has what it takes to be an outstanding vice president
9292609 i feel confident about my choice ill let john mccain talk about his
9292610 sometimes we can be a distraction in these kinds of situations we want to make sure that were monitoring the situation and that were being useful
9292611 i will do whatever thats required that is useful but right now the main thing thats useful is letting everybody out there know to please evacuate the area
9292612 we still have to persuade people that change is possible
9292613 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9292614 day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9292615 never again never again will a disaster of this nature be handled in the terrible and disgraceful way that it was handled
9292616 his campaign knows that being sensitive to gustav during his convention will make an important political statement
9292617 never again never again will a disaster of this nature be handled in the terrible and disgraceful way that it was handled
9292618 i hate the insides of my body for not working properly

9292624 it is difficult to speak adequately or justly of london it is not a pleasant place it is only magnificent it is the biggest aggregation of human life the most complete compendium of the world
9292625 i cant begin this great effort without honoring the achievements of geraldine ferraro back in 1984 and of course senator hillary clinton who did show determination and grace in her presidential campaign ms palin said
9292626 in a decent hardworking middle class family noted that she had been
9292627 and he knows what its like and she knows what its like to worry about mortgage payments and health care and the cost of gasoline added mr mccain who was faced with a barrage of attacks from democrats after he was unable to tell an interviewer how many houses he owns
9292628 hockey mom and got big cheers when she noted that her husband todd was
9292629 well i know that when senator mccain asked me to be his running mate he had a short list of highly qualified men and women she said
9292630 to have made that list at all was a privilege and to have been chosen it brings a great challenge i know that it will demand the best that i have to give and i promise nothing less
9292631 make no mistake about it he said at a rally in consol energy park home of the washington wild things baseball team
9292632 having the governor of an energy producing state who understands the importance of energy independence and who also understands that in this day and age we can extract fossil fuel in an environmental sensitive and sound way what a great partner for the next president of the united states
9292633 we call them snow mobiles they call them snow machines but we know how to have fun he said
9292634 he said very publicly and embraced as well he should the relationship he had with the minister in his church for 20 years he said
9292635 but when things got really heated two or three weeks later suddenly he changed his point of view towards that minister that he admired so much for 20 years
9292636 having the governor of an energy producing state who understands the importance of energy independence and who also understands that in this day and age we can extract fossil fuel in an environmental sensitive and sound way what a great partner for the next president of the united states

9292640 the game of billiards has destroyed my naturally sweet disposition
9292641 if it wasnt for erica i wouldnt know just how evil i am
9292642 meeting erica was a party by itself theres nothing like a meeting of the minds sometimes you feel more at home with someone youve never seen before than with people who have been in the background for years
9292643 i think i should be very careful with what i say lest folks get the idear were lesbos or something
9292644 you always succeed in making me laugh or cry and think and learn thank you for your blog its a treasure
9292645 youre such a delicate flower i want you to write the blurb for the dust jacket when i finally write my novel

9292648 i think someone oughta take ericas comments from all the blogs she visits and mash em together into a new blog
9292649 erica you possess formidable talent i am impressed yet slightly repulsed
9292650 i find myself wandering the blogosphere to read ericas comments almost as much as to read everyones posts really
9292651 oh my gawd what a cutie she is bright eyed and full of wonder i could just listen to that accent all day
9292652 oh erica it is always good to know that brooklyn is in the house

9292657 i can have a mason jar of grade a pure d buck goat pee especially delivered to the troll of your choice at any given time
9292658 erica has a heart two sizes too big for her may god bless her and keep her
9292659 omg i so totally rate right now erica has left anti nj words in the comments here on my blog
9292660 beating erica sherman at pool was a rare treat and i think perhaps people should know even at the expense of possibly coming off as a braggart for going on and on about beating this aforementioned individual at her own game
9292661 china julia child and yiddish how do these things go together why in a post by erica of course need you ask lol

9292667 blew the lead and cost the mets a much needed critical emotionally uplifting confidence building victory
9292668 everything i know about working hard i learned growing up in my grandpops home in green ridge
9292669 barack obama learned the same lessons while being raised by a single mom and his grandparents
9292670 barack obama favors loan guarantees to help detroit re tool and revitalize but john mccain refused to support loan guarantees for the auto industry now hes just paying lip service not talking straight
9292671 in the last 8 years the republican party has taken us from being the biggest creditor nation on the planet to the biggest debtor nation we increased the deficit more than every president in us history combined and economic disparity is the worst its been since the 1920s
9292672 no abortion even for incest rape life of the mother
9292673 failure is not the only punishment for laziness there is also the success of others
9292674 we should be taught not to wait for inspiration to start a thing action always generates inspiration inspiration seldom generates action
9292675 choice of palin promises failed energy policies of the past
9292676 protecting polar bears gets in way of drilling for oil says governor
9292677 its obvious that corry bliss should do some research on his own candidates position on the gi bill
9292678 drake says no vote on gi bill was due to veto warning
9292679 if the legislature passed a death penalty law i would sign it
9292680 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 a heartbeat away from the presidency
9292681 former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9292682 radioactive materials are long lasting which is what makes them both scary and misunderstood the smoke detectors in your home likely contain a radionuclide called americium but the reason to worry about them has nothing to do with radioactive material and everything to do with whether the detectors battery is working contrary to popular belief previously bombed geographies are not transformed into lifeless poisoned landscapes for the next 50 000 years hiroshima and nagasaki look just like every other bustling japanese city and crawling around in the grass of a city park there is no different than doing so in seattle or milan italy or auckland new zealand at least as far as radiation hazard is concerned
9292683 it is hard to think of a more cynical and contemptuous political act this year than john mccains selection of sarah palin as his vice presidential running mate
9292684 its a wild gamble undertaken by our oldest ever first time candidate for president in hopes of changing the board of this election campaign maybe it will work
9292685 there is no government in jerusalem that would ever reconcile itself to a nuclear iran when it is clear iran is on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons an israeli military strike to prevent this will be seriously considered
9292686 sane cheap and the only option that does not necessitate bloodshed
9292687 talk of the jewish holocaust and israels security doesnt impress these guys
9292688 its a shame because ido will light all this up
9292689 i t is that american spirit that american promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend
9292690 oh no i am glad to have a cell at some distance from the others as they cannot hear me i prefer to suffer alone as soon as i am petted i no longer enjoy myself
9292691 it is incredible that mr bopp while clearly identifying himself as speaking for the national right to life committee would state that embryonic experimentation is acceptable
9292692 it may very well be in our future that there is therapeutic research that can be done on human embryos and there is nothing unethical immoral improper or that disregards the sanctity of life if we are involved in therapeutic research
9292693 mr bopp clearly said he opposed creating human embryos for experimentation but said it could be ok to experiment on human embryos that already existed the thought that any representative of a national pro life group would endorse experimentation on the tiniest humans is outrageous
9292694 im very pleased with the quality and quantity of this years online gaming economy exhibition which promises to be the best one yet
9292695 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
9292696 wales is in an election process for bishop of bangor and the election has as one of its still secret nominees none other than jeffrey john
9292697 dr barry morgan is a man of his word he previously has said i barry morgan would ordain britains first gay bishop
9292698 if a priest had a same sex partner and someone nominated them that wouldnt be a bar to them becoming a bishop
9292699 although being on the slate is no guarantee of an election it is clearly something that archbishop morgan desires
9292700 senior appointments have a certain circularity about them deans and archdeacons are appointed by their diocesan bishops bishops in turn are appointed by an electoral college in which deans and archdeacons are a very strong presence
9292701 dr williams might well wish not to know until too late so that nothing is left on his doorstep for evidence
9292702 dr williams if you are on record as knowing about this and the event takes place despite all the moratoria recommendations that were made the archbishop of canterbury will not get a free pass on this one
9292703 wine was created from the beginning to make men joyful and not to make men drunk
9292704 he doesnt look like id imagined at all i like the bubbly enthusiasm and slight volatility of manner which dont come across in his generally grave forceful prose i had a joyful month reading his considerable corpus of on line essays here significantly his prose reveals goodness and intelligence where alas most left wing writers just come across as hateful dishonest self righteous hysterical and very much the kind of people who would have gladly joined the nkvd to purge the state of questionable elements i e anyone who disagrees with them
9292705 people talk about defending or exploiting cyberspace but we dont talk much about operating it if its under attack
9292706 its not easy work and its not work to be taken on by amateurs
9292707 every time we have a problem or a virus is loaded or someone comes in and takes over systems administration of a computer or a server we have to take that system offline scrub it and sometimes throw it away guess what that aint free
9292708 were trying to get our arms around how much this is costing us every time someone breaks into our niprnet unclassified but sensitive internet protocol router network some estimates are around 100 million a year some people think that figure is low
9292709 the operation and the defense of our network the commanders business
9292710 like in any other domain we need to train like were going to fight and were in the fight every day already
9292711 youre an idiot how about being partial in your reproting who are you john sterling

9292714 for a good time call mr met 718 577 tixx
9292715 i threw up just a little bit in my mouth
9292716 as someone who loves holiday song parodies this gets a big time thumbs up

9292720 dr stevenson has spent more than 30 years studying the cases of some 2000 children who spontaneously remember concrete details about dead strangers whose experiences can be documented

9292730 said it looked like he tried to delete this but she knew a way to go around and get some of the deleted stuff
9292731 i didnt know what i was looking for but i was there
9292732 in a neat symbolic fit the agent responsible for alaskas current moment of reform and modernization is a woman a breed once nearly as rare in far northwest politics as a democrat
9292733 she has a son in the military headed to iraq
9292734 what we need is a quick start a quick goal and then focus on getting the second one
9292735 we are definitely not taking them lightly as they are a fit team but we are better and well need to prove it on the field losing on sunday really bothered a lot of the guys theyll be ready for sure theres no doubt about that
9292736 ultimately a deep bench is crucial to winning this coming sunday and i expect a completely different pistolas team than last night
9292737 well have our keeper back our scoring leader and a host of other lethal weapons the key for us is really a deep bench weve now played two years together and had a great run this year were capable of beating any team in this league if we communicate pass well and get back to support our stellar defense we have by far the best keeper in the league we have guys coming off well desrved rest in eckleton andrew t eddy m davidinho and ronaldo if all goes to plan i expect a squad of 18 motivated guys this sunday looking to seek revenge on this silver team there are many different options and weapons on this team but the determination and heart is going to really be important in pulling together take no team lightly lets win this sunday boys
9292738 ive been advised by pistolas fc medical staff to not play for a month
9292739 which really means i hope to be back august 31st for the playoffs
9292740 ah the andrea blockage sorry to hear that the creative juices have ceased to flow and a danged beaver has dammed the rushing waters of positive thought

9292742 you can write the best book in the world but people won t buy it if they dont know it exists
9292743 as of 12 30 p m the battalion of the russian federation peacekeeping forces deployed in the north of the city had beaten off five attacks and was continuing combat
9292744 frankly we dont know what to do itll look like sanctions but we need to take a decision of course we could take a pause too
9292745 the major difference with the qosmio is that its just smoother and more advanced tracking technology
9292746 compared to sitting in a classroom or language lab learning a foreign tongue from a podcast doesnt feel much like work in the case of a free daily podcast from shanghai with lessons in mandarin chinese language study is actually fun
9292747 the more i think about it the more i find her chief demographic virtue to be not her sex but what her persona communicates about her class
9292748 any sharp attacks right off the bat will look like obama and biden bullying someone in the crowd at a town hall event
9292749 children with downs syndrome require an awful lot of attention
9292750 the role of vice president it seems to me would take up an awful lot of her time and it raises the issue of how much time will she have to dedicate to her newborn child
9292751 i guess my guess is that perhaps the line inside the mccain campaign would be if it were a man being picked who also had a baby but you know four months ago with downs syndrome would you ask the same question
9292752 miers infuriated the conservative republican base while palin if she appeals to any constituency in the party appeals most to conservatives
9292753 i guess my guess is that perhaps the line inside the mccain campaign would be if it were a man being picked who also had a baby but you know four months ago with downs syndrome would you ask the same question
9292754 if he gets the nomination the only way he could win against hillary or barack obama would be to be part of a mccain limbaugh ticket
9292755 shell be a tough candidate for the vice presidency and a fine vice president wholl shake up washington
9292756 we have released documents that reflect every one of the final terms of the senators purchase of the home
9292757 i think that uh you know campaigns start getting these uh hair triggers and uh the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9292758 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9292759 a criminal enterprise made up of 35 self described anarchists intent on committing criminal acts before and during the republican national convention
9292760 these acts include tactics to blockade and disable delegate buses breaching venue security and injuring police officers
9292761 the story peddled by latter day arab propagandists and reinforced by some jewish scholars who tended in decades past sometimes for apologetic reasons of their own to highlight the medieval
9292762 until the end of world war ii there was little precedent in islam for the anti semitism that was now warping the politics and society of the region jews had lived safely although submissively under muslim rule for 1 200 years enjoying full religious freedom
9292763 or consider esther webman of tel aviv universitys dayan center who has written that
9292764 the collapse of traditional political systems and of the loyalties
9292765 most crucial the development of the conflict with zionism over the domination of palestine
9292766 but this construct in bostoms view and in my own is wholly false
9292767 god has cast us into the midst of this people the nation of ishmael who persecute us severely and who devise ways to harm us and to debase us none has matched them in debasing humiliating and hating us
9292768 humiliation and wretchedness were stamped upon them and they were visited with wrath from allah that was because they disbelieved in allahs revelations and slew the prophets wrongfully
9292769 and for the evildoing of the jews and for their taking usury and for their consuming peoples wealth under false pretenses we have prepared for the unbelievers among them i e those not converted to islam a painful punishment
9292770 they hasten to spread corruption throughout the earth but allah does not love corrupters
9292771 the quran describes the jews with their own particular degenerate characteristics i e killing the prophets of allah corrupting his words by putting them in the wrong places consuming the peoples wealth frivolously refusal to distance themselves from the evil they do and other ugly characteristics caused by their deep rooted lasciviousness only a minority of jews keep their word but not all jews are the same the good ones become muslims

9292958 deco obviously is not zidane but he is very similar you expect one thing and then it changes that is very important for me he is one of the best players in the world with players like cristiano ronaldo and lionel messi i wouldnt ask him if he has the potential to be the best player in the world but i think inside his mind he thinks that but he wont talk too much about it he is too smart too clever for people to kick him out of a game he was not a rich man he was poor as a boy from very humble beginnings he played on the street so he knows what it is like to be kicked he is streetwise

9292966 despite a sterling reputation arsenals academy has achieved very little in terms of producing first team players to believe that wengers young teams are created from a burgeoning youth policy is not the complete picture certainly as far as true academy products are concerned the arsenal academy has been in existence for 10 years but in that time still no one has followed in coles and taylors footsteps the conclusion that can be drawn from the academys life is that its function is to provide back up players for the first team squad with the probability that they will eventually be sold on having failed to hold down a starting place

9292972 this was supposed to be their breakthrough season when they would finally attain the holy grail that is a champions league place the cossack cavalry is coming in the foursquare shape of spartak moscows roman pavlyuchenko but will he be enough and why so late spurs should have completed recruitment in time to bed down their new look team in preseason friendlies not still be scrambling to do it with no points on the board after two depressing results it is a fact of which ramos who has no control over such things is uncomfortably aware

9292978 if journalists and managers who have spent half a lifetime analysing such things can misconstrue capellos statements can the players be expected to fare any better it has emerged that steven gerrard thought he had been briefed to play on the left against the czechs whereas capello intended him to have a free role behind jermain defoe houston we have a problem
9292979 there are some england fans myself among them who would prefer gerrard to play even if he was under general anaesthetic with half his groin hanging out than watch frankie lumbering up the pitch devoid of purpose wed probably take gerrard with his right leg sawn off to be honest but this apparently is not an option owen hargreaves will not be fit to face andorra and croatia either i have to say i find this a bit of a mixed blessing i would take hargreaves over lampard but then i would take millwalls midfield dynamo alan dunne over frankie partly out of an unreasonable antipathy to the chap but partly also on the evidence of his england performances over the past three years if england feel insecure going into a match against croatia because hargreaves isnt fit then we really are in trouble hargreaves is a useful scampering monkey to have hanging about in front of the back four but he is not the man to orchestrate a victory or to turn a match on its head
9292980 your club always has to come first not just because of the growth in prestige of the champions league and the barclays premier league in the modern game but because they are your paymasters club first country second its how it has to be the other thing to remember is that england have more than enough quality players to emerge unscathed lets not start looking for excuses already
9292981 capello no doubt thought he would waltz in and tune england up tactically but perhaps he is only just realising this particular brand of player is not easily tuned capello can obsess about conditioning and tweak sophisticated strategies as all self respecting italian coaches do all the way to andorra croatia and beyond but if his players are hard wired to respond to other things then we have a problem
9292982 afterwards itv asked sir alex ferguson for his reflections and he had the temerity to say it had been a good performance
9292983 you told me that about anton ferdinand and hes up in sunderland having a medical
9292984 uefa are hopelessly compromised as an organisation by the influence and interests of the big clubs and richer nations and while platini made certain promises to europes lesser lights on his way to power the story of his presidency has been an inability to bring about any significant changes other than the token disbandment of the g 14 pressure group we should not expect too much of a man who awards a champion league final to rome whose police simply dont deserve it then warns spectators to be on their best behaviour a little late platini also joined in the debate over ronaldos summer behaviour he did the right thing he said when you have signed a contract you dont break it good to know someones got their eyes open
9292985 for the majority sick to the back teeth of hearing the names cristiano ronaldo gareth barry and dimitar berbatov the suspension of transfers and thus transfer related tittle tattle will come as a blessed relief for the production team at sky sports news though it will create problems what with having to studiously ignore euro 2008 this summer uncorroborated transfer gossip was all the football ssn had to discuss before the premier league season started and over the past week its unsubstantiated rumour mongering has reached a new pitch of desperation concrete facts are so thin on the ground that the channels regular text vote polls routinely include option c no opinion demonstrating that having no opinion is no impediment to getting it heard on sky sports news
9292986 he failed a drugs test but it was not for a performance enhancing substance it was a personal problem he was dealing with its effect on his football was secondary and weve all seen how much he has improved with this new found focus in italy here is where i think the incredible hypocrisy over mutus case comes in compare him to joey barton this young man who at 25 ought to know a lot better during his time at manchester city was fined only 60 000 for stubbing a lit cigar out in a youth players eye he was kept on after assaulting a 15 year old everton fan fined 120 000 and sent to the sporting chance clinic for help he wasnt even sacked after beating teammate ousmane dabo in a vicious training ground assault for which he was sentenced to a four month suspended prison sentence the fine 100 000 and dabo was the one who left the club
9292987 the rossoneri have never been a side to stake a season on a team of youngsters but where is the even spread of experience in the milan dressing room realistically the only players under 25 who are good enough for regular first team spots are alexandre pato and mathieu flamini this just isnt good enough from a team that is expected to compete and win at the highest level so why then is there such a gap in the middle age group which is usually bristling with experienced young talent the answer is that adriano galliani and co have not taken the time to realise that areas of the team need strengthening well before players are too old or have been moved on

9293269 it would be one thing if she had only been governor for a year and a half but prior to that she had not had major experience in public life
9293270 the fact that he would have to go to somebody who is clearly unqualified to be president makes obama look like an elder statesman

9293306 iran is certainly taking advantage of the crisis in relations between moscow and washington in order to develop its nuclear technology
9293307 russia has sought the political support of countries in the organisation among them china but received a cool response iran could work to convince countries that are members of the sco like kazakhstan and kirghizistan to support the russian position in georgia
9293308 in exchange tehran would have strong political support for its nuclear programme

9293325 shes going to learn national security at the foot of the master for the next four years and most doctors think that hell be around at least that long
9293326 is the glass half empty half full or twice the size it needs to be
9293327 the palin selection completely undercuts the argument about obamas inexperience and readiness to lead to gratuitously undercut the remarkably successful is he ready to lead line of attack seems near suicidal
9293328 i realize of course that shes totally unqualified to be president at this point in time if mccain were to die in february 2009 i hope palin would have the good sense to appoint someone who is more ready to be president to be her vice president on the understanding that she would then resign and be appointed vice president by her successor
9293329 can anyone say with a straight face that palin would have gotten picked if she were a man
9293330 the longer i think about it the less well this selection sits with me and i increasingly doubt that it will prove good politics the palin choice looks cynical its a wild gamble undertaken by our oldest ever first time candidate for president in hopes of changing the board of this election campaign maybe it will work but maybe and at least as likely it will reinforce a theme that id be pounding home if i were the obama campaign that its john mccain for all his white hair who represents the risky choice while it is barack obama who offers cautious steady predictable governance if it were your decision and you were putting your country first would you put an untested small town mayor a heartbeat away from the presidency
9293331 she came off looking immature herself almost high schoolish it was conduct unbecoming a governor
9293332 mccain has chosen to balance his ticket with a principled conservative governor palins life story is one of sticking to principle she is living proof that a person can take on the corrupt political establishment including corrupt leaders in her own party and achieve great things
9293333 congratulations to john mccain for hearing and responding to conservatives conservatives the base of the party have been listless but now nearly all will work enthusiastically for the mccain palin ticket in fact this is the most enthusiastic conservatives have been since the era for ronald reagan
9293334 this is a grand slam home run conservatives feet havent touched the ground since this announcement
9293335 i dont know anything about her personally but having a woman on the ticket will help offset the mistake obama made in choosing biden instead of hillary
9293336 im very excited that shes truly a washington outsider we dont have enough people in washington who understand the importance of local and state government ohio families are hurting and a mother of five may be just what it takes to put their problems first in washington
9293337 i think hes mistaken if he thinks women just vote for women because theyre women women vote for women they know to be qualified for the job
9293338 a great choice that will create excitement for the ticket
9293339 todays announcement was an act of political desperation by the mccain campaign but it does not alter the fact that the republican ticket promises ohioans more of the same
9293340 their first important decision as a possible future president is who theyll select to be a heartbeat away from the presidency and john mccain failed miserably in this first major judgment call
9293341 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done sen mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington

9293355 first because it wont help hubl and the others but mainly because helping them is not its real purpose its real purpose is to let ferdinand and his friends feel theyre not absolutely pointless its just moral exhibitionism

9293528 for you formed my inward parts you covered me in my mothers womb i will praise you for i am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are your works and that my soul knows very well
9293529 as you do not know what is the way of the wind or how the bones grow in the womb of her who is with child so you do not know the works of god who makes everything
9293530 assuredly i say to you inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren you did it to me
9293531 dont follow the crowd because they may lead you and your generation into the abyss which may take years to recover from

9293533 trig is beautiful and already adored by us we knew through early testing he would face special challenges and we feel privileged god would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives we have faith that every baby is created for good purpose and has potential to make this world a better place we are truly blessed
9293534 the view that such events are caused by god is a matter of opinion faith if you will and are not capable of proof every man must decide for himself whether or not hurricane katrina brought the wrath of god down on new orleans
9293535 although the loss of lives is deeply saddening this act of god destroyed a wicked city from girls gone wild to southern decadence new orleans was a city that had its doors wide open to the public celebration of sin may it never be the same
9293536 hurricane katrina was in fact the judgment of god against the city of new orleans
9293537 new orleans had a level of sin that was offensive to god
9293538 there was to be a homosexual parade there on the monday that the katrina came
9293539 the topic of that day was cursing and blessing what happened in new orleans looked like the curse of god in time if new orleans recovers and becomes the pristine city it can become it may in time be called a blessing but at this time its called a curse

9293552 new orleans spooked by predictions that hurricane gustav could grow into a category 5 monster an estimated 1 million residents fled the gulf coast saturday ahead of the official order to get out of the way of a storm taking dead aim at louisiana
9293553 yes that would be one way of putting it and theres probably something in that i think if you go back to our remote darwinian past youre dealing with a time when we lived in small groups like baboon troops where most of the people that you met would have been close kin and also most of the people that you met would be people youre going to meet again throughout your life who therefore are in a position to reciprocate then again you made your highway code point which i think is a good one that its in every individuals interests to obey whatever the particular highway code is if you drive on the left in this country youd better not drive on the right on the other hand if you move to a country where they drive on the right you should do that so conforming to the social mores is another reason for obeying a code and being as we would call it moral of course if you go back to the remote darwinian past when we were as i said surrounded by close kin and by people who were likely to be able to reciprocate that doesnt explain why were still good to each other even though we now live in big cities and are not surrounded by kin and are not surrounded by potential reciprocators i think the answer there is probably that what natural selection builds into brains is rules of thumb which used to work at one time in the same way we have heterosexual desire even though we are using contraception as intelligent darwinians we know perfectly well that the heterosexual lust that we feel is no longer fulfilling its darwinian purpose but we still feel it and why on earth shouldnt we because it was built into our brains and its still in our brains similarly our remote ancestral past built into our brains the rule of thumb be nice to everyone you meet and the reason was because everyone you met would be a cousin or be nice to everyone you meet and the reason was that everyone might have been a potential reciprocator now its no longer true so were in the same position as somebody who enjoys sex even though theyre using contraception we still feel a lust to be good a lust to be nice a lust to be altruistic to be cooperative i think that that darwinian impulse filters through a conduit of modern cultural conventions and then of course refined by law by parliamentary discussion by journalism by just ordinary conversation over the centuries which gives rise to the sort of civilised values that we have today and which with hindsight you can if you wish graft onto certain verses of whatever your holy book happens to be
9293554 weather obeys physical laws but if you change one breath of air those laws will spin out in a wholly different story meteorologists began talking about something they called the butterfly effect the idea was that if a butterfly chances to flap his wings in beijing in march then by august hurricane patterns in the atlantic will be completely different
9293555 edgy and intensely heated this cowboy story is especially good alison kent never fails to deliver
9293556 writings not rocket science its a helluva lot harder because once you learn all that rocket science crap you can at least in theory build a rocket on the other hand you can read every writing book known to man and attend classes and work with critique partners and get pages of editorial input and still end up with a book that doesnt quite hit the high notes scary but true
9293557 can i be blunt on this subject if you dont have time to read you dont have the time or the tools to write simple as that reading is the creative center of a writers life
9293558 you know im a storyteller we are storytellers and ours is an ancient tradition contemporized by the cinema and the capturing of light and we should all be very proud of our place in society on any given night millions of people across the world buy a ticket for adventures that only we as storytellers can provide we release burdens we galvanize emotions we make people laugh we make people talk over breakfast this is a great job and i want to encourage every one of you in this room to give everything you can to the story god bless narrative god bless originality
9293559 when i write i feel like an armless legless man with a crayon in his mouth
9293560 dont be afraid of your material or your past be afraid of wasting any more time obsessing about how you look and how people see you be afraid of not getting your writing done
9293561 my new years resolution is to focus on the book and forget all the crap that surrounds the writing business to lose myself in a story and not give a damn if it makes any lists has a good sell through gets glowing reviews on amazon pleases my editors hell even pleases my readers i want to love what im writing so much that none of the rest of it matters and if i dont i wont write it lifes too short to abuse the muse
9293562 america is now wholly given over to a d d mob of scribbling women and i should have no chance of success while the public taste is occupied with their trash and should be ashamed of myself if i did succeed what is the mystery of these innumberable editions of the lamplighter by maria susanna cummins and other books neither better nor worse worse they could not be and better they need not be when they sell by the hundred thousand
9293563 as for my next book i am going to hold myself from writing it till i have it impending in me grown heavy in my mind like a ripe pear pendant gravid asking to be cut or it will fall
9293564 the storyteller is deep inside everyone of us the story maker is always with us let us suppose our world is attacked by war by the horrors that we all of us easily imagine let us suppose floods wash through our cities the seas rise but the storyteller will be there for it is our imaginations which shape us keep us create us for good and for ill it is our stories that will recreate us when we are torn hurt even destroyed it is the storyteller the dream maker the myth maker that is our phoenix that represents us at our best and at our most creative

9293606 an appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile hoping it will eat him last
9293607 if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization it expects what never was and never will be

9293612 public officials throughout our country need to be encouraged and reminded that they can and should resist the increasingly radical demands of secularist groups with regard to invocations before public meetings
9293613 it is sad that some radical secularist groups are trying to eliminate one of our oldest and most cherished american traditions
9293614 as you know there is simply no question that a legislative body may open its sessions with an invocation
9293615 public prayer has been an essential part of our heritage since the time of this nations founding and our constitution has always protected this activity moreover such prayer can include sectarian references without running afoul of the first amendments establishment clause

9293622 any man that doesnt stand up to protect their own assets doesnt deserve to be here
9293623 only study bible that presents the text of the new king james version in chronological order
9293624 it bothers me when bad historical criticism trumps narrative structure
9293625 its primarily a set of theological texts that have historical significance not a set of historical texts that have theological significance
9293626 removes the significance of the authorship through that process of transmission
9293627 most people judge their well being not by measuring where they stand but rather based on whether they think their circumstances and income will improve in the coming years because most now have so much relative to a generation or so ago its hard to expect the coming years will bring even more

9293638 you ruined my life america now i will destroy your world
9293639 i think that he has always been an individual rights person on the second amendment
9293640 obama has always expressed a belief that the second amendment guarantees a private right to bear arms
9293641 said consistently that i believe that the second amendment is an individual right and that was the essential decision that the supreme court came down on
9293642 one other issue thats of great importance here in the district as well is gun control but you support the d c handgun ban
9293643 he also opposed letting people use a self defense argument if charged with violating local handgun bans by using weapons in their homes the bill was a reaction to a chicago area man who after shooting an intruder was charged with a handgun violation
9293644 we hunt as much as we can and im proud to say our freezer is full of wild game we harvested here in alaska
9293645 always believed that the second amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms but i also identify with the need for crime ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common sense effective safety measures

9293657 one of the worst security lapses in afghanistan in the six years since the united states intervention here so serious that if the taliban had wanted to they could have seized control of the city of kandahar
9293658 sex addiction is a real condition that affects the lives of many people and instead of being about someone who wants to have sex all the time usually involves a compulsive fear of intimacy maybe you could show a little compassion before you pass such severe judgements on people you dont have any way of knowing anything about
9293659 investors have the right to know all the associated risks and companies need to disclose risks to investors from its stake in coal burning power plants and any related liability from global warming lawsuits and new regulations or laws

9293666 i saw two gentlemen die in front of me because of dehydration i saw a baby near death the sanitation was unbelievable the stench in there was unbelievable dead people around the walls of the convention center laying in the middle of the street in their dying chairs they were just covered up babies two babies dehydrated and died
9293667 a couple of the drivers do not want to go in thats how bad it was i guess somebody was putting out some bad news that it was totally unsafe
9293668 police according to their chief eddie compass found themselves in multiple shootouts inside both shelters and were forced to race toward muzzle flashes through the dark to disarm the criminals snipers supposedly fired at doctors and soldiers from downtown high rises
9293669 the information i had at the time i thought it was credible
9293670 compass however promulgated some of the unfounded rumors himself in interviews in which he characterized himself and his officers as outgunned warriors taking out armed bands of thugs at every turn
9293671 people would be shooting at us and we couldnt shoot back because of the families
9293672 i had the impression that at least 40 or 50 murders had occurred at the two sites
9293673 its unfortunate we saw these kinds of stories saying crime had taken place on a massive scale when that wasnt the case and they national media outlets have done nothing to follow up on any of these cases they just accepted what people on the street told them its not consistent with the highest standards of journalism
9293674 there were five long minutes during which nothing happened the hearts beat thunderously in the circle and a small vein on the side of each neck throbbed in harmony with each heart the heads turned quickly from side to side as each one assured himself of his neighbours and the breath of life steamed away on the north wind most sweetly as each realised how beautiful life was

9293719 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in

9293832 these results are significant in that they address the two key unknowns in this area
9293833 the data from on time 2 shows the importance of diagnosing stemi at the earliest possible point in the cascade of events that lead to a heart attack thereby allowing for the initiation of anti thrombotic and triple antiplatelet therapy including aggrastat as early as the ambulance setting thereby fully optimising the outcome for the patient
9293834 on time 2 tells us more than the benefit of aggrastat
9293835 2 on time 2 is the first ever study to investigate the efficacy and safety of aggrastat which belongs to the glycoprotein iib iiia inhibitors gpi class of anticlotting medicines in stemi patients in the pre hospital setting a significant reduction in the percentage of patients with more than 3 mm residual st segment deviation one hour post pci in the aggrastat group versus placebo 38 7 percent versus 45 0 percent respectively p 0 024 a median of 60 minutes pre pci administration of aggrastat in the ambulance or referral centre setting significantly reduced cumulative st segment deviation before pci compared to placebo 11 4 one hour after pci cumulative st segment deviation as a continuous variable was also reduced with early aggrastat 6 0 mm p lt lt span gt 0 005 in the no aggrastat to our current standard of care in primary pci for ami not only provides us with an efficacious treatment option but also a safe one the combined endpoint of death recurrent myocardial infarction mi or urgent target vessel revascularization utvr was reduced without a significant increase in bleeding

9293837 iroko is committed to furthering its clinical research in this area and exploring aggrastat s potential as an early intervention strategy for patients with acute myocardial infarction
9293838 these results are significant in that they address the two key unknowns in this area firstly the value of early intervention with glycoprotein iib iiia inhibitors on top of the standard treatment of aspirin heparin and clopidogrel in stemi patients and secondly the most effective timing of that intervention
9293839 the data from on time 2 shows the importance of diagnosing stemi at the earliest possible point in the cascade of events that lead to a heart attack thereby allowing for the initiation of anti thrombotic and triple antiplatelet therapy including aggrastat r as early as the ambulance setting thereby fully optimising the outcome for the patient

9293842 our finding that routine pre hospital initiation of aggrastat r improved st segment resolution and clinical outcome after pci emphasises that early and intensive platelet aggregation inhibition is mandated in patients with stemi undergoing pci

9293869 but it lends more credence to the argument that the mccain campaign is a war room masquerading as a campaign theyre not thinking about governing theyre thinking about winning
9293870 barack obama picked a running mate who can help him govern the presidents job is far too big for any one person to do on his own so obama took the first step toward building a first rate team john mccain engaged in a cynical stunt aimed at winning the news cycle its an incredibly arrogant decision that calls into question whether he really understands the nature of the job hes running for
9293871 if mccain were in his 50s or even his 60s or weren t a cancer survivor palin would be a more understandable pick but given his age and his medical history picking the single least qualified candidate in the modern history of the presidency and vice presidency is simply a dangerous decision for the nation
9293872 i cant help but be oh a little bit skeptical of republicans sudden interest in the glass ceiling
9293873 mccain s selection of alaska governor sarah palin as his running mate is a triumph of republican identity politics

9293896 michelangelo had to more or less teach himself on the job fresco painting 60 feet high in the sistine chapel for four years
9293897 the mosaics and frescoes of the period abandon the abstractness of earlier art and the figures are depicted more in a three dimensional view and with a real sense of movement
9293898 michelangelo had to more or less teach himself on the job fresco painting 60 feet high in the sistine chapel for four years
9293899 the frescoes are like an architectural fantasy whatever you wanted the interior of your house to look like youd paint it on the wall
9293900 lets immediately make it clear that leonardo hasnt made a mistake in the technique of the fresco
9293901 strolling throughout town discovering many different art forms is one of the greatest pleasures dervied from visiting oberammergau
9293902 the search for the tassili frescoes the rock paintings of the sahara
9293903 frescoes by their very nature are fairly stable long lasting works but like anything else they are subject to deterioration especially if not properly cared for
9293904 thus far weve found that the frescoes suffer from some common problems that you might expect in a public place such as humidity air currents that carry dust and grease based soil and scratches from cleaning and simply being exposed to innumerable passersby over the years in addition since the frescoes are actually part of the building structure they are vulnerable to the stresses of building expansion and contraction
9293905 they prove upon closer inspection chiefly to be early copies after the finished fresco occasionally deliberately trying to pass themselves off as original sketches

9293915 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterizing the past decade continues
9293916 we could have no ice at the north pole at the end of this summer and the reason here is that the thin ice and this ice we call first year ice the ice that tends to melt out in the summer
9293917 its possible that ships could sail from alaska right to the north pole
9293918 clearly if you look over what we have seen in the past three years and where we were headed we are in this long term decline and we may have no ice at all in the in summer by 2030 or so
9293919 take on global warming and how is it affecting our country

9293923 i have a hard time seeing how her qualifications stack up against the duties and responsibilities of being president i expect her to stick with simple truths when asked about continued american troop presence in iraq she said she knows only one thing about that i paraphrase no one has attacked the american homeland since george bush took the war to iraq

9293951 even in her seventies she drove her self unmercifully working until the early morning and keeping her attention focused simultaneously on the biggest issues and the smallest details of government
9293952 i cant help feeling that if she did not have an r next to her name all these outraged people would be celebrating her
9293953 we americans trust ourselves to run the country much better than the crowd in d c has been doing
9293954 dont tell us those in small towns that we dont have what it takes to keep a county on the right track
9293955 i have no doubt that there are at least 100 000 americans who can easily perform the duties of president 1 out of every 3000 easy to find sarah palin is one of these she will do fine
9293956 i think obamas going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
9293957 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
9293958 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
9293959 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
9293960 t he practice of arbitrary imprisonments have been in all ages the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny
9293961 how many houses does palin add to the republican ticket
9293962 youll have to meet with so and so in order to deliver this and that
9293963 i was about to go home when you came now its going to be hours

9293966 he was making 23 an hour can you believe that
9293967 hell protect a womans freedom of choice because government should have no say in whether or when a woman embraces the sacred responsibility of parenthood
9293968 they can choose what they want to choose and we can choose what we want to choose thats america thats what democracy means thats what freedom means thats what individual rights mean
9293969 we believe in the right to choose for our personal health and we know the right choice to protect that right to choose it is president barack obama and vice president joe biden
9293970 now you have to be pretty radical to have a zero rating
9293971 why is it that not supporting naral and planned barrenhood is radical while 100 devotion to the two leaders of the abortion industry is somehow emblematic of freedom goodness rights and choice
9293972 it was the right to control our reproductive systems that made it possible for almost all of us to achieve our own dreams which our parents had paid for
9293973 here in america and especially here tonight we need to remember two basic truths
9293974 society has an obligation and christians have a gospel duty to provide adequate and compassionate support for unwed and abandoned mothers women facing unintended pregnancies and women struggling with the aftermath of an abortion
9293975 heres the second truth killing an unborn child is never the right answer to a womans or societys problems acts of violence create a culture of violence and abortion is the most intimate form of violence there is it wounds the woman it kills the unborn child and it poisons the roots of justice and charity that bind us all into one human family
9293976 whatever the ruling body decides it will protect or enforce
9293977 we as mere men and women have the ability to impart supernatural meaning unto a child if youre not wanted you are merely a clump of tissue and cells to be discarded if youre wanted you become by our divine initiative sacred beings who must be protected at all costs must not be left behind must be treasured as our nation and worlds future and so forth
9293978 john mccain has taken a bold step today in choosing gov sarah palin as his vice presidential running mate gov palin has risen to every challenge shes faced and her choice is historic for alaska and for the women of america sarah brings a great deal of excitement to the campaign and she makes alaskans proud gov palin understands and is a leader on the most crucial issue facing our nation today energy her candidacy will highlight alaskas critical role as a state that can help meet our nations energy needs through domestic oil and gas exploration and development sarah has built an impressive record as governor of alaska and she will bring a valuable outside the beltway perspective to john mccains candidacy gov palin is smart energetic and her choice as the republican vice presidential candidate represents a new direction in the race for the white house

9294010 in most peoples vocabularies design means veneer its interior decorating its the fabric of the curtains and sofa but to me nothing could be further from the meaning of design design is the fundamental soul of a man made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service
9294011 designers solve problems for clients artists solve problems for humanity the latter is the greatest problem
9294012 form follows function that has been misunderstood form and function should be one joined in a spiritual union
9294013 when i am working on a problem i never think about beauty i only think about how to solve the problem but when i have finished if the solution is not beautiful i know it is wrong

9294017 a government that sat on its hands while a major american city drowned before our eyes

9294026 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9294027 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9294028 i am quite confident that in fifty years each of us will have a copy of our own complete dna sequence incorporated into a highly accurate electronic medical record and accessible from anywhere in the world perhaps this will even be encoded on a chip thats been inserted under the skin of the forearm along with a large amount of other medically important information
9294029 will all this high technology result in a change of our views about humanity will we see ourselves as molecular machines rather than creatures capable of noble actions and concerns for our fellow human beings i am not too worried about that yes science will provide us with many opportunities
9294030 is the wave of the future toward a more utopian society or toward one with distinct economic and strategic advantages
9294031 in fifty years we will likely be at the start of a new rapid evolution of mankind
9294032 it is interesting to speculate what will mark the turning point when evolution brings us from humans toward the next level

9294041 our culture is suffering from an overdose of action and a shortage of contemplation i consider contemplation a basic need you even see it in animals just think about dogs and cats you often see them staring off into space i think thats their way of meditating their way of recharging their batteries we have that need too but we deny this basic physiological need as if an entire society were to forget to go to the bathroom thats serious
9294042 we are pretty confident it was after the sponges split from trunk of the tree of life and sponges went one way and animals developed from the other that nerves started to form
9294043 what we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves something we never expected to find
9294044 is we took some of these genes and expressed them in frogs and flies and the sponge gene became functional the sponge gene directed the formation of nerves in these more complex animals
9294045 ron pauls antics in the alaska gop primary show he does not care about the conservative movement but advancing himself and getting earmarks for his district

9294065 if we consider not only how extensively attacks on life are spreading but also their unheard of numerical proportion

9294075 it is difficult to imagine any acceptable basis for the usda to subject the owner of a chicken to more intrusive surveillance than the owner of a gun

9294149 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work
9294150 thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
9294151 calling into question the tribal customariness of this practice is all well and good but in so doing the senate seems to be intimating that a pre existing woman burying custom might under some circumstance be regarded as a mitigating factor
9294152 black women were appropriated and deployed in the broader attack against 2 live crew
9294153 republicans talk about putting country first but tell that to marion indiana they sent my job overseas america cant afford more of the same we need a president who puts the barney smiths before the smith barneys
9294154 america is like a healthy body and its resistance is threefold its patriotism its morality and its spiritual life if we can undermine these three areas america will collapse from within

9294165 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9294166 and foreign policy expert mccain has 4 000 lives to answer for

9294169 this morning i had the spin and just wasnt able to make up the gap to mikko i thought it was over and wed lost the chance
9294170 but then it all changed and we were leading again but this was really a difficult rally changing all the time with some strategy coming in too
9294171 i needed to win for sure and thats very nice but im not happy for what happened to mikko because he was doing really well and it was a good battle but these things happen sometimes
9294172 i was really confident that we were going to win this rally but what could we do
9294173 we had a slow puncture that dropped us to third but im not going to let this knock my confidence
9294174 i know we can win rallies the season isnt over yet so we just have to go flat out again on the next rallies
9294175 i think the best way of doing good to the poor is not making them easy in poverty but leading them or driving them out of it
9294176 when we conduct polls the responses we get are we dont know how to manage someone we cant see
9294177 honestly from a business perspective gas prices are not as much a factor
9294178 that doesnt mean that senior management isnt concerned and doesnt see that as a definite problem but they still run their businesses and what they are going to react to is when it starts to affect their turnover and ability to attract employees they wont necessarily implement something unless they see it as a win for both

9294181 snooping on your neighbours to report recycling infringements sounds like something straight out of the east german stasis copybook
9294182 it is outrageous that they want us to pay for a licence so animals can listen to the radio we wont pay it instead the cats will have to go without we have been told we can have it on during out of office hours but the cats dont want it on when they are trying to sleep
9294183 if the music is predominantly for the cats then a licence is not required and we would not charge these people for a radio licence prs will investigate this case to ensure that the customer has not been incorrectly assessed and if a mistake has been made we will apologise

9294189 there are eight levels to charity one above the other the greatest level and there is no level greater than this is one who strengthens the hand of a jew who is poor and he gives him a gift or a loan or he makes a partnership with him or he finds him work in order to strengthen his hand until he is no longer required to ask others and about this it says leviticus 25 35 and you shall strengthen him the proselyte or resident so that he shall live with you this means to say strengthen him until he will not fall and be in need
9294190 the torah commands us to give 10 of our earnings to charity to the kohen and levite
9294191 since you are now harvesting only 100 stalks of wheat although you had originally harvested 1000 it must surely be a sign that g d has promoted you and you have now become the kohen
9294192 do not say i will study torah when i have free time because perhaps you will not have free time
9294193 and you shall strengthen him the proselyte or resident so that he shall live with you
9294194 do not allow him to decline and fall and it will be difficult to lift him up rather strengthen him from the moment of the faltering of his hand to what is this comparable to a burden on top of a donkey while it is still on top of the donkey one person can hold it and set it in place once it falls to the ground five people cannot set it in place
9294195 when there will be amongst you a very poor person of one of your brothers in one of your gates in your land that g d your l rd gives to you do not close your heart and do not close your hand from the poor person you shall surely open your hand for him and lend him a pledge to whatever he is lacking
9294196 and your eye will be evil against your poor brother and you wont give him and he will call to g d and it will be a sin to you you shall surely give him and you heart should not be grieved when you give to him because it is because of this thing that g d your l rd will bless you in all your deeds and in all the performance of your hand
9294197 if you do not give to him in the end you will become just like your poor brother

9294220 even with the loss of almost 10 000 acres of prairie dogs conata basin still remains the largest and most important prairie dog complex on federal lands in the great plains its worth all these efforts to save it
9294221 theres the plague and the prairie dogs and thats nature taking care of the expansion

9294247 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9294248 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9294249 as if what do we look like a bunch of complete lackwits you guys will believe anything
9294250 and its just like the democrats to attack them and by implication our entire american way of life and by further extension the very human act of eating and by even further extension life itself and by extensive extension the very concept of existence both for human beings and indeed for the entire universe and perhaps even alternative universes
9294251 this is a bold and visionary choice by john mccain
9294252 the trade in pork and pork products is absolutely central to americas military might and economic development in the 21st century there is simply no better choice for vice president and in fact any objective observer must question why there is nothing made of pork nor in fact anything that is consumable in any way on the democratic ticket
9294253 shouldnt worry about the flooding again were not saying we have to evacuate the city because of the flood
9294254 are very sorry about the situation and share the disappointment of the festival goers
9294255 regrettably unable to perform at the rock en seine show in paris due to illness

9294259 they came in together and were very touchy feely there was a lot of hand holding there is a saltwater infinity pool and an open air shower sienna loved that
9294260 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9294261 our helicopters were barely able to fly for most of the day yesterday as it continued raining heavily till 4pm
9294262 these are some of the worst floods in generations and they present a huge challenge for governments and humanitarian organisations
9294263 a large number of houses have collapsed in the area
9294264 when im not working i want to be myself i dont have assistants bodyguards or even a driver because i try to pretend in my own head that this isnt happening i think a lot of actresses live in this cotton wool world but im very free spirited and i want to be able to live the life i do i was well known before i had a film out but i dont court attention i dont go to other peoples premieres i havent been out to a club in london for years
9294265 no one should ever watch tom and jerry because it is a violent cartoon
9294266 she has an extraordinary talent when it comes to communicating personally with people its as simple as that
9294267 that obviously propelled her into the governors mansion in alaska
9294268 i made a deal with president hadzi risteski and if he leaves his job i think i have to leave as well
9294269 maybe the new president who takes over will have a different idea of who they want in charge of the team but up till now the macedonian fa have been very good with me and helped me get the best out of the side so if they leave i will go too
9294270 my two dreams are to help lazio win a trophy and to help macedonia reach the world cup
9294271 both are hard but not impossible the national team is experienced but also has enough quality to fight for a place in south africa we have to respect the rivals in our group but we believe in own abilities if we want to be in the top two we have to pick up three points in our first two games i honestly think we can do that
9294272 i dont worry about my goals only about my performances
9294273 we now believe we have a chance in every game we play with katanec in charge we play more offensive football and we have an ambition to win games no matter who the opponent katanec is a man who can prepare his players psychologically he always tells us that we are not less worthy than our opponents and that was a big problem for us until now we always played well against stronger teams but lost against weaker ones like andorra but when you play a big team you always have greater motivation
9294274 i dont want the players to be tense and try too hard as thats when mistakes are made
9294275 i the prime minister have come to office in the appropriate way and i wont resign i will not back down i will rule this advertisement country and will lead it through all of the problems
9294276 i have been very patient and have refrained from using force
9294277 many have criticised me for being too soft but if the government cracked down we would be criticised for using excessive force
9294278 if they say we can advertisement t guarantee your safety you dont go
9294279 these subjects are part of a longer and midterm discussion
9294280 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country invading and occupying our country then recognising part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy
9294281 we are not going to be drawn on the details of that conversation the next step will be the european council meeting
9294282 arizona is changing it used to be a more reliably republican state but as people have come in from other states they have taken their politics with them mccain has the same problem with republicans in arizona as he has with republicans in the rest of the country
9294283 he is conservative enough on social and foreign policy and some economic policy to appeal to those elements while also deploying the occasional liberal view which appeals to independents and undecideds
9294284 if you cross him he doesnt forget hes like an elephant
9294285 but he is just as famous for his showy acts of conciliation luxurious gift baskets saying im sorry i blew up at you
9294286 a large part of him and his appeal is that he feels he can talk himself out of anything and he is notoriously fearless when challenged
9294287 at least i dont plaster on the make up like a trollop you c
9294288 i think he is mentally unstable and not fit to be president
9294289 when are we going to send an airmail message to tehran
9294290 listen pal i spent 22 years in the navy my father was in the navy my grandfather was in the navy we in the military service tend to move a lot we have to live in all parts of the country all parts of the world i wish i could have had the luxury like you of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of arizona but i was doing other things as a matter of fact when i think about it now the place i lived longest in my life was hanoi
9294291 for a politician mccain sure talks a lot of sense i admire him he has life experience and he speaks out for what he believes in
9294292 i wouldnt vote for obama no way hes a muslim
9294293 t advertisement he people didnt want to join and we didnt have enough money
9294294 if the us administration sees that its war against the muslims is legitimate then what makes us believe that our war on its territories is not legitimate
9294295 everyone must know that we will not hesitate in targeting it whenever we can and wherever it is on this planet
9294296 a group that had limited its terrorist activities to algeria is now part of the global jihad movement
9294297 these groups as best we can tell have a fair amount of independence they get inspiration they get sometimes guidance probably some training probably some money from the al qaeda leadership
9294298 its not as centralised a movement as it was say in 2001 but in some ways the fact that it has spread in the way that it has in my view makes it perhaps more dangerous
9294299 the brothers implementing the process are connected with us and we have previously trained some of them and we offer them adequate support for the implementation of such operations
9294300 successfully employed by insurgents and terrorists in iraq and afghanistan
9294301 terrorism has been vanquished despite the sporadic manifestation we are facing up to in the most energetic manner
9294302 the least experienced least credentialed person to join a major party ticket in the modern era
9294303 seems solely interested in winning the daily news cycle his staff spends its time gleefully churning out juvenile attack videos mccain himself has retreated into robotic incantations of simpleminded talking points and now hes chosen a manifestly unqualified vp that he knows nothing about
9294304 warning that gustav is the mother of all storms mayor ray nagin late saturday ordered a mandatory evacuation of the west bank of new orleans for 8 a
9294305 you need to be scared and you need to get your butts out of new orleans right now
9294306 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9294307 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9294308 to just have it planned at the same time that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river
9294309 entered into an unhealthy relationship on an emotional level with a female member of his staff
9294310 an end time army has one common purpose to aggressively take ground for the kingdom of god under the authority of jesus christ the dread champion
9294311 the trumpet is sounding calling on fire revolutionary believers to enlist in joels army many are now ready to be mobilized to establish and advance gods kingdom on earth
9294312 get busy in constructing a bible based social political and religious order which finally denies the religious liberty of the enemies of god
9294313 as the church begins to take on this resolve they joels army churches will start to be thought of more as military bases and they will begin to take on the characteristics of military bases for training equipping and deploying effective spiritual forces
9294314 in time the church will actually be organized more as a military force with an army navy air force etc
9294315 some pastors and leaders who continue to resist this tide of unity will be removed from their place some will become so hardened they will become opposers and resist god to the end
9294316 sometimes you go to war with the media you have not the media you wish you had
9294317 youre right senator ive held real jobs didnt carpetbag my way to a senate seat and never made 100 000 in one day of trading
9294318 hes as blind as he can be just sees what he wants to see
9294319 americans think that all afghans are terrorists and they send rockets and missiles against us
9294320 i myself buried more than 50 women and children are all of them terrorists
9294321 suddenly the infidels attacked and i lost consciousness when i came to i was in hospital and they told me that all of my family were dead and already buried was my two year old child a terrorist then am i not also a terrorist why did they let me live
9294322 palin is the most libertarian republican thats been on a major ticket for a long time this ideological storyline should appeal to many western voters
9294323 for me the biggest selling point is that she went after her own party when she saw that they were corrupt
9294324 the companys activities are undertaken with a view towards preserving the pristine environment and delicate balance of the natural forces in the dead sea region
9294325 palin is strongly opposed to abortion and supports capital punishment while running for governor of alaska palin supported the teaching of discrimination while the previous administration did not implement same sex benefits palin complied with an
9294326 a priest friend points out that tim pawlenty is a fallen away catholic and wonders if thats a liability i actually dont think it makes a difference to catholics even if theyre sorry to hear hes left the fold i assume evangelicals would welcome a convert running but that assumes social conservative evangelicals are kinder to religious converts than they were to a mormon political convert
9294327 a calculated course of criminal conduct and cynical criminal manipulation of the democratic process
9294328 anyone accusing him of involvement in last nights fire would therefore be acting without respect for due process or the rule of law
9294329 contrary to what the gop probably hoped she scored less well with women than men
9294330 zanu pf dismissed that not just as insolent but also because it demonstrated stunning ignorance on how government works
9294331 the death toll has risen to three in huili county a large number of houses have collapsed
9294332 mrs palin now must clear a daunting hurdle first the media then public opinion since the press is unfamiliar with her she will be treated as a target for aggressive scrutiny in the past surprise picks like mrs palin have faltered in the face of a media onslaught and never recovered mrs ferraro though more familiar became an albatross for mr mondale in 1988 dan quayle was quickly turned into a joke for late night comics
9294333 the right is nothing if not filled with liars and hypocrites
9294334 its a black hawk inaudible the guys are doing a training exercise yeah inaudible yeah thats right morris is being evacuated from the building
9294335 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9294336 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9294337 an analysis of obamas dnc speech from the rude one and its very rude and very true
9294338 as for that vp talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration
9294339 mayor c ray nagin on saturday night ordered a mandatory evacuation of this city ahead of hurricane gustav which swelled from an already deadly tropical storm into a monster depression with winds of more than 150 mph
9294340 if that is the finished product of much work dont give up the day job
9294341 this critique of my web design came from a man who believes that this monstrosity is an acceptable image to place in their sidebar enough said

9294343 its an honour to be asked to join the board and i feel it will dovetail nicely with my ecb role
9294344 suppose the internet was entirely confined to the u s which it once was that wasnt helpful
9294345 because of the nature of global telecommunications we are playing with a tremendous home field advantage and we need to exploit that edge
9294346 we also need to protect that edge and we need to protect those who provide it to us
9294347 since passage of the patriot act many companies based outside of the united states have been reluctant to store client information in the u s
9294348 there is an ongoing concern that u s intelligence agencies will gather this information without legal process there is particular sensitivity about access to financial information as well as communications and internet traffic that goes through u s switches
9294349 its no different than any other infrastructure that a country needs
9294350 are on a rampage to build out across india and china so they have alternative routes and so they dont have to route through the u s
9294351 we discovered the internet but we couldnt keep it a secret
9294352 whether its a good or a bad thing depends on where you stand
9294353 suppose the internet was entirely confined to the u s which it once was that wasnt helpful
9294354 were probably in one of those situations where things get a little bit harder
9294355 this is one of many dimensions on which well have to adjust to a reduction in american ability to dictate terms of core interests of ours
9294356 we are by comparison militarily weaker economically poorer and technologically less unique than we were then we are still a very big player but not in control
9294357 i have been running for three weeks and im hoping to be playing at the end of october
9294358 if things keep going as well as they have been thats where i will be if it goes well it could be sooner
9294359 i just cant wait to be playing because i have no doubt in my mind i will be fitter and stronger than before
9294360 the way i have looked at it is that im not going to think about the lions and im not going to think about england im going to think about playing well for my club
9294361 its special for daniel he has been fantastic since he arrived and he will be remembered long after he has gone
9294362 hopefully its not as bad as first feared but thats rugby league and scullys a tough guy hell deal with it
9294363 we tried to put the points on the board a bit too early before building the pressure
9294364 hulls defence was fantastic and they made us make mistakes
9294365 we prepared for the toughest game of our lives we have a healthy respect for this hull side and we had to play the full 80 minutes it was a gutsy effort from the boys
9294366 we almost found a way to lose i thought we squandered ample opportunities in the first half we had genuine try scoring plays
9294367 i had a real bad feeling at the start of the second half i thought it was going to come back to bite us
9294368 we are a very good front running team but i knew the first try would provide momentum for hull
9294369 credit to us we were honest for 80 minutes and i think that got us through it was a tough game i dont think people realise how much the first half took out of us
9294370 he was a stand out today his presence at the back was very calming for the team
9294371 im very proud and have been since i came to st helens
9294372 i knew i was coming to a fantastically traditional club with some of the worlds great players
9294373 ill go home with some fantastic memories and have been very privileged to be the coach
9294374 that was one of the fastest games i have played in all year it was end to end in the first half
9294375 we had a couple of chances in the first half but all credit to them hull they just kept coming back at us it was like an arm wrestle
9294376 north and south are like poles apart on a compass
9294377 those scientists dont know a cows ass from its antlers
9294378 it is good for us to be here do you think hed mind if i swam out your way

9294388 its really the only time in your life that youre supposed to gain weight
9294389 it was brutal i would order my favorite things from restaurants and i would get it and say get that thing away from me grilled chicken or tomatoes would be the worst i would tell my husband to get it away from me
9294390 all i wanted was cheerios it was all i could eat for two months
9294391 the fox knows many things but the hedgehog knows one big thing
9294392 this is something i pretended to do when i was mucking about as a kid
9294393 we had to show character but that is nothing new for this group
9294394 the snp are in danger of scaring people away from becoming teachers as they dont think they can find a job at the end of their training
9294395 the snp can try and shift the blame to councils as usual but the buck stops with them
9294396 the snp have imposed cuts in education right across scotland
9294397 they have broken their promises while labour delivered 53 000 more teachers and smaller classes
9294398 we will be monitoring the post probationer employment situation for this year through the next gtcs survey which is due to be undertaken in october
9294399 we have made clear that there will be a steady flow of employment opportunities due to retirals this year
9294400 the actions and words of hillary clinton have gone from being merely disappointing to downright disgusting
9294401 this wasnt a guy taking a video camera into a theater this was an inside job a copy made from a high quality master
9294402 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven to just have it planned at the same time that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river
9294403 i have been running for three weeks and im hoping to be playing at the end of october

9294406 the way i have looked at it is that im not going to think about the lions and im not going to think about england im going to think about playing well for my club
9294407 if we have to dump her well have to make it look like the pressure came from the obama campaign and they did it because they are against women we might be able to use this as another obama attack on hillary and all women if we handle this right it can be a win win situation where either way because if we have to dump sarah we can get women voters to hate obama
9294408 no way is craig fit for international football and ive told him and john toshack exactly that
9294409 he has just come back and 20 minutes was all he could do even then he kept asking me to wait and wait
9294410 we needed what he gave us but we cant rush him back
9294411 everything goes really fast and i wasnt really stopping to think about what i was doing i was doing what i was trained to do
9294412 an award for every single one of the soldiers that were out there and the ones that cant come home
9294413 echipa noastr era mai bun dec t cea de acum a lui peseiro
9294414 i am very disappointed at the high number of vehicles seen with items on display or evidence they have been there
9294415 simply removing items of value from your vehicle and locking it makes it less attractive for a thief yet hundreds of drivers in the town are continuing to put their property at risk
9294416 criminals will break into your vehicle if they see something worth taking if you leave your mobile phone charger plugged in the thief will go looking for the handset
9294417 if theres a mark left on the windscreen after you removed your sat nav cradle the thief will wonder if the units in the glove compartment or boot
9294418 if theres a coat on the back seat the thief will think there might be a wallet in the pocket or something hidden underneath
9294419 this is a unique and i hope effective way to raise the profile of both these issues i am very much looking forward to the event
9294420 something like this hasnt happened for about 10 years so its a huge deal
9294421 its a fantastic way of promoting two causes but we will have to hold on to the sheep because the police are concerned they might launch themselves into the thames
9294422 the safe quality drinking water that they expect and deserve
9294423 i understand that the company is in the process of upgrading the treatment works which is involved in this outbreak
9294424 i will be calling for the company to get its other remedial works done as quickly as possible
9294425 its no good waiting until people are ill they have to be given the warning to boil their water and take precautions themselves
9294426 we have a grandmother living here my mother in law and shes very fragile so im concerned as to how that would affect her
9294427 and also of course theres all the boiling of the water theres seven of us living in the house
9294428 prompted us to take this precautionary measure to protect public health
9294429 what the pfi private finance initiative scheme has enabled us to do is to build state of the art healthcare facilities for birmingham and the west midlands
9294430 these facilities will be second to none in the country and were very proud of it

9294490 you can get a clean unused 9mm automatic for 1 500 a glock for a couple of grand and you can even make an order for a couple of mac 10s
9294491 or you can get a little sawn off for 150 theyre easy enough to get hold of youll find one in any poverty area every estate in london and its even easier in manchester where there are areas where the police dont go
9294492 there has been an influx from eastern europe and particularly from poland and there are also a lot coming in from people who have served in afghanistan and iraq
9294493 in liverpool docks you can put in an order for 10 guns and some grenades and theyll say ok and two weeks later they will be there and they are straight goers
9294494 they are legally sold in germany and wont fire a bullet but they can be converted by removing the partially blocked barrel and replacing it with a rifled barrel
9294495 after other small alterations it can then fire 9mm bulleted ammunition the replacement barrel is longer than the original and is threaded so that it will accept a silencer which is commonly sold as part of the package
9294496 someone will have a tool and there is always one guy in a posse willing to use it they will have one guy who doesnt give a fuck
9294497 you can go to the former soviet union or countries with less stringent regulations than ours and although british customs have their successes many guns appear to be smuggled into the uk
9294498 a gun used to be used as a mediator now everything is revolved with a gun its brought the heat on everyone before you would get a two years jail sentence now its a five its getting like the us now like the wire its like a prediction of what will happen here i think they all think theyre playing grand theft auto its madness out there
9294499 its almost like the design of an object has no bearing on how its used
9294500 well team it looks like youve got everything down just the way weve been working on no need for any more practices i think there are still a couple of flights to tijuana leaving later today go down have a good time call me if you need a good lawyer and well see you back here for the next game

9294534 for me to be included im pleased my main focus is to enjoy my cricket as i know i dont have a lot of time left
9294535 we are all extremely disappointed that this delay has occurred
9294536 a full investigation is now taking place into the cause of the error we will make sure that it does not happen again
9294537 we put a great deal of time and effort into this new way of booking tickets and are hugely disappointed in this delay
9294538 40 years ago this august the streets of chicago became a bloody open forum on the politics of power and resistance as the democratic national convention lapsed into chaos and protesters in the streets were met with the gas and bayonets of law and order the ghosts of this unresolved history haunt us to this day we meet on august 28 in grant park to peacefully purge these ghosts and to make sense of our past through ritual reenactment a living history lesson for the city of chicago which asks where were we then and where are we now
9294539 and though it seems that were in a similar place now with people who are fed up with a rogue government and another insane war many people seem complacent and apathetic why
9294540 the success of anonymous protests against scientology has given us a new model
9294541 i think the questions this group asks are a good starting point for a dialogue
9294542 every cat ive ever known has been perfectly happy with the box in its original form
9294543 do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain
9294544 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
9294545 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a swing state hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
9294546 with all due respect again to the governor she s been a governor for three years she s been able but undistinguished
9294547 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that she s done
9294548 so if he were to pick the governor it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what im really not first and foremost concerned with is this person capable of being president of the united states
9294549 much of chases data processing and record keeping including records of home mortgages and portfolios of major customers such as pension funds
9294550 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
9294551 is not prepared to discuss integrity bank at this time
9294552 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9294553 and it is warm not something im really used to
9294554 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9294555 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me
9294556 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9294557 can step in and become president and i dont think anybody has any doubt about that
9294558 counsel and advice of somebody whos not going to agree with me 100 percent of the time
9294559 but for the rest of us theres still no change
9294560 we plan to start when were going to start and end when were going to end
9294561 were facing what could be a very strong hurricane possibly one of the largest and strongest to hit america since records began
9294562 we have gone from a reactive organization to a proactive organization
9294563 theres no reason for anyone to stay in new orleans to ride out this storm
9294564 we cant stop the damage from happening what we can do is move people out of harms way
9294565 everyone on the left is angry about the palin pick
9294566 but second and more important i have been somewhat taken aback at the hot blasts of anger from the left and more generally from likely obama voters
9294567 right left are so angry look at the comments on kos redstate trope
9294568 the discussions of palin i hear on the news seem disparaging to motherhood and what it takes to be a mother
9294569 and about andrew sullivan he is definitly angry but not at palin but mccain for what he sees as a completly cynical betrayal of everthing mccain said he was supposed to stand for i agree with that take
9294570 also some people think it actually matters who the vice president is
9294571 it doesnt matter what party i represent the vp nominee should demand respect for their intellect
9294572 the biden pick didnt matter as much as the palin pick because mccain is 72 and a cancer survivor
9294573 many of us on the left feel very sincerely that one of the central flaws of the bush administration has been that they just didnt take the idea of good governance seriously
9294574 whereas biden will be 66 in a few months and has had at least two brain aneurysms so if god forbid something were to happen to obama the country would be run by a guy who could drop dead any second
9294575 are you being insulting to avoid addressing a point that makes you uncomfortable why is your worst case scenario okay but mine isnt
9294576 if the vice president dies the president can appoint a new one to be confirmed by congress so while it is certainly possible that biden could die and then obama could die before his replacement is confirmed that seems much less likely than a 72 year old man with a history of cancer dying
9294577 this is something i pretended to do when i was mucking about as a kid
9294578 we had to show character but that is nothing new for this group
9294579 i am innocent of this mans blood the responsibility is yours
9294580 no one can take my life from me i sacrifice it voluntarily for i have the authority to lay it down when i want to and also to take it up again for this is what my father has commanded
9294581 the most frustrating thing has been the indolence of many of the authorities their insensitivity
9294582 i have often asked myself why why me why my daughter
9294583 the message is get to work or well hold you accountable
9294584 politkovskaya was the heart of russia its the regime that killed her
9294585 the search is part of an ongoing investigation regarding serious criminal acts
9294586 items that could be used for direct action techniques ranging from computers xboxes xbox games molotov cocktails and matchstick heads
9294587 the warrant was dictated by the needs of the investigation and the criminal behavior of the suspects
9294588 im furious about this that you cant come to a meeting space without the reasonable expectation to be unmolested by police
9294589 its an obviously blatant act of harassment and intimidation to suppress political dissent
9294590 you do this in a police state i guarantee you they are not going to find anything illegal
9294591 we are not going to be like animals or to be like the homosexuals god save us from that you understand we have to take the judgment the judgment is to kill them
9294592 he is muslim and he gets out of islam he doesnt want any more what are we going to do we kill him kill kill
9294593 we are not blind followers of any government or any clerics we criticise other religions just as other religions criticise islam we encourage integration into society
9294594 some of the statements are deeply offensive but it would be very wrong and quite unfair to smear the whole centre
9294595 we are hoping to have a quick unfolding of this investigation so we can basically reconcile these numbers which are way too far apart right now
9294596 it is obviously a case where all three have received different bits of information and they need to reconcile this
9294597 obviously there is somebody that does not have the right information
9294598 as we have already said we support the idea of a joint investigation in which all relevant institutions are involved this must be a broad based investigation we believe this is a right way forward and we will be open and cooperative
9294599 everybody is willing to find the truth and to do this you got to get to the facts and compare information that everybody has received
9294600 one of the few bright points out of the current energy crisis is that it has given alternative energy a kick in the pants
9294601 found the right partner to fight those who put their privilege ahead of their responsibility
9294602 its not the kind of buzz you want to play golf on trust me the kind of nonsense thats been in my head for a whole week is not the right kind of pressure
9294603 its so mentally draining to listen and read all the bs all week
9294604 youve read it you wrote it some of you might be guilty or not i dont know but boy what a hell of a week im spent exhausted i didnt want to finish the last two tournaments like this missing cuts so well have to see
9294605 im very frustrated ive not settled into this golf course very well this week

9294614 i understand that the company is in the process of upgrading the treatment works which is involved in this outbreak
9294615 i will be calling for the company to get its other remedial works done as quickly as possible
9294616 its no good waiting until people are ill they have to be given the warning to boil their water and take precautions themselves
9294617 we have a grandmother living here my mother in law and shes very fragile so im concerned as to how that would affect her
9294618 and also of course theres all the boiling of the water theres seven of us living in the house
9294619 prompted us to take this precautionary measure to protect public health
9294620 andrew is disappointed but we need to keep high standards
9294621 andrew accepts our decision i know him pretty well and i hope he goes away from this and gets himself right and gets himself back into our team because hes a very important player and we certainly want him as part of our squad
9294622 its so hard to play for this team in my opinion we are the greatest sporting team in the world so we have standards and they might be higher than other teams
9294623 if you dont fulfil those standards unfortunately youre not going to be a part of our squad
9294624 i hope he doesnt take it personally because andrew is one of my closest mates so its certainly not personal
9294625 i guess thats why weve made this decision because we want andrew back in our team for as long as he wants to be a part
9294626 but right now for the best interests of the team and for the best interests of my friend andrew symonds i believe weve made the right decision
9294627 i believe when weve got such young impressionable faces in our team we need to make sure our senior blokes are 100 per cent spot on to the way they go about presenting themselves and that was an issue that wasnt being carried out with andrew
9294628 its all about how much good work is out there and who wants it enough to pay the highest price for the best of it
9294629 show your devotion to americas greatest organized activity by making your house smell like a football factory
9294630 but new orleanians are very resilient very tough and well get through this

9294632 things we were doing during katrina we already did two weeks ago
9294633 as long as its out of harms way its ok
9294634 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9294635 if you dont go out of your house and stay put you should be fine
9294636 i dont think ive even cried from katrina yet i havent had time
9294637 if we leave from here everything you got is stolen when you get back
9294638 there is no question we are taking this storm seriously
9294639 if we dont get the wind and rain we stand ready to help them
9294640 the impact is going to be felt over a wide area
9294641 things werent really as bad as they could have been

9294675 theres a 6 year old who looks at me and says are you really the president and i said yes i am and he said youre not dead yet he thought the president was thomas jefferson a president was a dead white guy

9294686 a short strike will be relatively inconsequential by the time we get to 2009 well forget about it
9294687 a longer strike will have more material consequences particularly for the 787 and it will make boeing continue to think about alternatives to the seattle work force

9294695 these over the top bullying tactics are reminiscent of the kind of censorship one would see in a stalinist dictatorship with the only difference being that those guys generally had to wait until they were in power to throw people who disagreed with them into jail

9294697 i think that women we have to get away from the politics of victim this is about you go out there and you fight
9294698 i think that what hillary clinton did was tremendous for the country she has kicked open many doors which now we have to bring many more women through millions more women through my being speaker of the house was breaking the marble ceiling in congress which is hard sen clinton had a bigger challenge to run for president of the united states what we have to do now is say we have to translate that not just for individuals but for all women
9294699 there are a lot of good things on the horizon for alaska but the only way the state can make these things happen is to have leadership in our state government that people can trust with our current governor we have an atmosphere of distrust and this has been aggravated by the recent fbi raids on legislators offices and anti industry sentiment in our state
9294700 we can get this trust and transparency back and we must start within our own republican party there are a lot of good things on our republican party agenda and this is all the more reason to move to re establish trust in the political system

9294711 that is why it is so important for all residents to seek medical attention should they develop symptoms that could be due to west nile virus infection
9294712 not everyone was texting each other and taking their phones everywhere and iming
9294713 what e mail has done to relationships i think it has ruined high school you used to have to go to a girl and talk to her they text now its a different world and all of that stuff is great for stories
9294714 were trying to make it reflective of what kids really do and what its really like
9294715 our version is a little dirtier and edgier but its also going to show that despite how much money these kids come from essentially they want to be popular and liked its all the same emotions whether you grew up working class in michigan or upper class in beverly hills
9294716 trust me your concerns about sachs judah doing 90210 are the same concerns everyones having including jeff and i
9294717 we were the first ones to go can we pull this off
9294718 there are so many things that are very important now that didnt exist eight years ago
9294719 when you look at the old show the characters look very outdated and the fashion is outdated so theres a new version to do but what i loved the most about redeveloping the show was having people from a different part of the country move to beverly hills and contemporizing that point of view
9294720 ive been doing this for a long time and ive never seen quite the amount of attention that this network has been getting from gossip girl and 90210
9294721 i think theres something to be said about being a part of pop culture right now and building assets for our parent companies theres got to be a new way of measuring viewers because our viewers are much younger and they consume content differently
9294722 were used to doing shows that a couple of years later people say oh i saw that on dvd and that it was really good
9294723 were not used to people knowing exactly what we did until two years after its been canceled
9294724 the old show was great because it put issues out there but the way that it handled it was very after school special
9294725 you had the walsh family always at home ready to listen to their problems and give them snacks in this show the parents have their own lives and their own drama and its just more realistic
9294726 you think its all glitz and glam and everybodys rich
9294727 but people have some secrets and they hide them you get to see the lives of real people and how they adapt to somewhere as beautiful and as ugly as beverly hills
9294728 gabe and jeff have so much to say about their own coming of age stories
9294729 its something they really enjoy writing and its evident in the script
9294730 i must be the worst manager ever in the history of baseball right now walking a guy that just came from being on top of big brown to beat the white sox
9294731 right now hes on a roll i get opportunities to walk him to face big papi i will do it whoever hits in front of him this guy right now is on fire no matter what you throw there hes going to get it
9294732 hes ok he didnt really impress me he beat a team that right now is not swinging the bat well the first inning he threw all fastballs were a fastball hitting team and we couldnt get him when you deserve credit ill give you credit he didnt impress me he was good enough to beat the white sox tonight
9294733 after that first guy i settled down got into a rhythm
9294734 i thought his poise and his mound presence was outstanding
9294735 i mean these guys are winning the central or i dont know if they are but theyre a team thats going to be fighting for a playoff spot and we played well the last two days and hopefully we can come out and continue it
9294736 that is the single most important thing mccain needs to do in the convention
9294737 he has to make clear he not only is not george bush but that he would not govern like george bush
9294738 hes got to try to soften some of the gop negatives

9294742 the landscape up here is littered with people who have underestimated her
9294743 maybe she is not ready for prime time or maybe she is going to litter the national landscape with people who have underestimated her
9294744 the previous governor had like a 20 approval rating they were tired of this just relentless brute ignoring the public mentality then the fbi raids all she had to do was show up and she got elected
9294745 theres always been a little bit of an air of an opportunist about the governor
9294746 it would be incorrect to say the bill came from the governor
9294747 theres a real question whether shes a republican or a democrat
9294748 she has succeeded in her own limited policy agenda as a republican governor by having the democrat caucus in lock step with her
9294749 her administration had the appearance of paying absolutely no attention to any of the rest of the unglamorous side of government
9294750 whether it be dealing with human services public services highways all the routine aspects
9294751 once we started talking about it it was mentioned again that fans are still wondering about her
9294752 once we started talking about it it was mentioned again that fans are still wondering about her
9294753 this morning i had the spin and just wasnt able to make up the gap to mikko i thought it was over and wed lost the chance
9294754 but then it all changed and we were leading again but this was really a difficult rally changing all the time with some strategy coming in too
9294755 i needed to win for sure and thats very nice but im not happy for what happened to mikko because he was doing really well and it was a good battle but these things happen sometimes
9294756 i was really confident that we were going to win this rally but what could we do
9294757 we had a slow puncture that dropped us to third but im not going to let this knock my confidence
9294758 i know we can win rallies the season isnt over yet so we just have to go flat out again on the next rallies

9294771 it was a good way to finish the series but the indians played well and deserved to win it
9294772 we kept making mistakes throughout and were not consistent in the batting department
9294773 credit goes to the boys for the way we came back in this match
9294774 these tracks are said to be slow but the bounce has improved over the last few years
9294775 our bowlers bowled well and we fielded well also but we didnt bat well

9294788 itll be a matter of whether we can get in and out before the hurricane hits or if we have to wait until after it hits
9294789 its changed the mind set of a lot of us in the military and out
9294790 i just remember all the traffic jams coming out of the city

9294796 you cant go anywhere else and see the variety of cars you see here
9294797 it has been a year of lines to get a pass for tonights beck concert and some crazy long lines for other things

9294799 i would have loved if we could have met in the final
9294800 my biggest worry is that she is so good im worried how im going to get past her more than anything
9294801 she played well that time but im looking forward to continuing to serve well move well and play well out here

9294814 when you found out your baby would be born with down syndrome did you consider killing it before or after the due date
9294815 rush just now imagining a series of questions that obama can ask palin if they ever meet
9294816 when you learned that you were going to have a down syndrome baby did you consider aborting it before or after the due date
9294817 it is an exploration of this mystery of a woman who has an emotional journey that takes her to extremes i wanted to explore how people can get so damaged
9294818 the permafrost now has small holes we have found elevated levels of methane above the water surface and even more in the water just below it is obvious that the source is the seabed
9294819 is that you dont have to get up early like bird watchers butterflies need at least 17c to start flying and that means theyre not about until 10am and then at their most active at midday and in the afternoon when its hottest
9294820 weve lost our homes weve lost our clothes weve lost everything
9294821 we are taking our children and leaving and we dont even know where we are going
9294822 my hungry children are crying and we are eating raw rice without boiling it
9294823 i know how villagers are somehow managing to keep themselves alive by eating whatever food is available to them
9294824 it is not easy to distribute food to over two million displaced villagers i know their condition
9294825 she kept the energy high and kept the crowd motivated
9294826 since then i was hooked i try to follow her everywhere she goes
9294827 a lot of people that i have really appreciated as musicians have come and done this
9294828 everything that you hear or that you read has been left behind by someone else that came through
9294829 this is a memorial for all the dead and wounded service members who fought in iraq and afghanistan
9294830 weve got more than 4 000 markers but im not sure if well have enough room
9294831 we thought well well go to 1 000 if we need to but hopefully it wont get that far and then it became 1 500 it just continued now were over 4 000
9294832 its a reminder that we have a war going on and theres a cost to that war theres a real cost and we dont want people to forget the sacrifice
9294833 you look at some of these placards and you see that the soldiers are 18 19 20 year old kids
9294834 and some are 47 or 48 how many kids did they leave behind and then you think about not only these guys but the wounded the guys coming home with no arms or no legs and then you think about all the iraqis who died its troubling
9294835 and it puts in perspective how many people there are who have died in iraq
9294836 they were just lining up around the building around the corner
9294837 people came from fort lewis mcchord air force base whidbey island bremerton im really excited about the turnout
9294838 we try to do as much as we can with the military because theyre right next door
9294839 weve never done anything like this before being able to host this is just a fun deal
9294840 palin proved her pro life credentials in a powerful way earlier this year year when she gave birth to her fifth child born with down syndrome despite receiving pressure from doctors to abort
9294841 its inspiring as much for me to see 2 000 riders for two days 150 miles to help raise money for a condition most of the them dont have
9294842 i knew right away that id have to stop running
9294843 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it
9294844 employers should be careful that they are going to get sued they are treating employees unfairly in the first place and wasting human resources in the context that they are relying on these weight based stereotypes
9294845 this is what weve hoped for years to come out
9294846 hes looked at the stereotypes and proven that they are not true
9294847 steady growers in the health care and consumer staples space held up better
9294848 we are not trying to call a bottom as there could still be some pain to unfold
9294849 single country funds are risky but if you must own one this is a good choice
9294850 i applaud your commitment to health and need your help on something im easily distracted by noise and many of your snack foods are loud i need your help brainstorming solutions that would work for both of us
9294851 interpersonal edge breakthrough tools for talking to anyone anywhere about anything
9294852 we are at an important inflection point for currency markets that the dollar may be forming a multiyear bottom against the majors and may also rally against some emerging market currencies
9294853 ask the headhunter reinventing the interview to win the job
9294854 when we last met here in jackson hole the nature of the financial crisis and its implications for the economy were just coming into view
9294855 the high blood pressure medicine thats the one i make sure i take
9294856 their lifestyle hasnt changed whats changed is how expensive its all becoming and how static their income has been and what you see is a growing sense of struggle
9294857 were just now starting to feel worried about how things are going to go in the next few months
9294858 for all our own concerns we have a lot of sympathy for younger people with families and all those expenses
9294859 you cant deplete your reserves because if things start to not go well for you you cant turn around and ask your child for help since he or she is the one youve been helping its a new burden and you need to make sure that youre covered
9294860 they can make some foolish mistakes if you dump all of the money on them in a relatively quick period of time
9294861 a trust structure puts another person between the child and the money and it also offers other benefits like creditor and divorce protection
9294862 the biggest mistake that grandparent caregivers make is going through their whole retirement pensions and bank savings before realizing or finding out that there are some financial resources although limited that might have helped them
9294863 grandparents as parents a survival guide for raising a second family
9294864 in todays age you might think that youre financially independent but it depends on how you model your retirement
9294865 even if youre worth several million dollars it may not cover you depending on your lifestyle and how long you live
9294866 you can finance college but you cant necessarily finance your retirement
9294867 dont feel guilty if you cant cover the full bill
9294868 caregivers often feel alone and isolated not knowing where to turn who to turn to where to start
9294869 when they join a support group they meet other families whove been in a similar situation and who can help them navigate the system to get the resources they need they need to know that theres help out there that they dont have to do this alone and that their feelings of being on a roller coaster from day to day are perfectly normal
9294870 the stock was bad last year and now it has been cut in half this year
9294871 im hoping for a rebound maybe to get me back some of these losses is the one day rally a sign that it hit bottom
9294872 for every dollar they lose in print ad revenue newspapers online operations industrywide are recapturing maybe 14 cents
9294873 these are companies trying to keep their heads above water
9294874 cutting costs in the face of declining revenues is a survival mechanism not a buy signal
9294875 the business model is taking on water and the companies will change because they have to
9294876 but cutting back on employees or eliminating sections to cut down on newsprint are not going to be the moves that change things for newspapers theyre just helping them stay afloat right now
9294877 were trying to get them thinking about and planning for plan b and plan c in the event their first choice is not available
9294878 the first semester the economy was still good jobs were aplenty i didnt think there would be problems
9294879 but as soon as 2008 hit the economy took a big downturn and the jobs dried up from last year to this year its changed quite a bit and its definitely been more difficult than i had anticipated
9294880 this market is one that just really needs to be navigated
9294881 its not like the old days where someone could pop a r sum out there and get 15 interviews and five offers you have to seek out opportunities more than in the past in the past they were coming to you
9294882 having a college degree is not the guarantee of a good job with benefits the way it used to be
9294883 and college graduates are now being affected by the kind of squeeze being put on the middle class and blue collar workers for a long time
9294884 its a loss of resources its a social loss these are bright people who could be engaged in more productive activities but we havent figured out how to move them into productive activities
9294885 mainly the reason im doing this is because there are not a lot of jobs and i would rather be my own boss
9294886 in a tight labor market like this i would say employers are looking for the upper hand and trying to get more bang for their buck
9294887 theyre looking for different things theyre looking for the internship theyre looking for someone who is more aggressive
9294888 a lot of students have pride they dont want to ask mom and dad for connections but you need to tap into every network you have
9294889 as recent graduates coming out of college they need to be open to multiple types of career opportunities
9294890 most of our site is written analytically hes writing it very personally and its getting positive feedback
9294891 the average person would be amazed at how many people read the web in the middle of the night
9294892 has been one of the pleasant surprises of the convention
9294893 what you send out via twitter has to have some news value
9294894 if theyre following you for journalistic reasons they will not follow you unless you have a very good track record of quality tweets
9294895 we found that the professional quality videos that we can lift from youtube are better than the ones we can produce ourselves at this point
9294896 theres been more buzz about her being here than her actually posting on the web site
9294897 filmmakers dont work on a daily or an hourly deadline
9294898 i think we can run our stores better than someone else
9294899 there are so many full service chinese restaurant that do takeout thats just an incredible amount of competition for panda express
9294900 a little sweet a little sour and a little spicy
9294901 orange chicken has a huge following using lower cost thigh meat is a tremendous advantage for them at a time when a lot of quick serve chains are going to more expensive breast meat
9294902 i became very attentive to customers because i was desperate not to have people leave and never come back
9294903 it is always fresh and it is healthy there are lots of vegetables that are good for you
9294904 what would i do with the money would i open more stores i dont have money issues so why do it
9294905 i think we can run our stores better than someone else
9294906 i felt good all day and just kept making birdie after birdie after birdie and then on the front nine a couple of eagles really boosted the round for a while there there certainly was a chance of 59
9294907 their heart has been in the industry for 25 years
9294908 it is such a shame that it has come to an end but these are hard times for the restaurant industry
9294909 this is a family business and my brother graeme who was restaurant manager has had his job axed too
9294910 al final la mejor funda para el iphone 3g es
9294911 the bottom line from this study is that australians think now is the time to adopt a climate change program that has some real teeth
9294912 they believe that climate change will cause serious problems in australia and elsewhere in the world and they understand there will be sizeable cost going along with it
9294913 the lower income houses and seniors very strongly support labors plain to redistribute the income to those households while the middle to high income households clearly support reducing the gst
9294914 the public clearly favours spending 20 per cent of the money on r amp d even though we told them that if they did that they would redistribute less money to the public
9294915 that shows the australians are very forward looking they see it as a long term problem and the r amp d efforts will help them get over the hump
9294916 we need a social license the ok from the community to operate
9294917 we call it the movement thats taking the nation by storm
9294918 you still have to be a tinkerer to make things work but thats changing
9294919 were going to see a lot more design features for recycled water and rainwater catchment
9294920 allows california to grow but in a way that is consistent with our environmental goals
9294921 gas prices certainly may have an impact on growth patterns but i think thats only one piece of it
9294922 im not confident that the current state of gas prices alone will combat sprawl
9294923 this is not about mandating where people live but it is about urging our cities and counties about being more thoughtful about where people live
9294924 its discrimination against the state of alaska during a time when gas prices are high and we need to look at all options to issue something that shuts off a viable resource
9294925 the amazing thing about this litigation is that the governor of alaska is so anti environmental that she is suing the bush administration over a claimed overabundance of protections for the polar bear
9294926 i think it shows the strength of our legal theory
9294927 basically we said list the polar bear and when you list the polar bear youre going to have to do something about greenhouse gas emissions the fact all these other parties are suing over it shows the bush administration doesnt have a legal leg to stand on they know the administration has to do something about greenhouse gas emissions
9294928 well it rains on the just and the unjust alike
9294929 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it
9294930 were not against growth but we are against growth that destroys our wetlands and takes away our trees
9294931 this is too unique and too special a place to be treated with condos and those kinds of things
9294932 you dont just allow a landowner to come in here and do this to your town
9294933 it sets a precedent for a disregard for the natural features it sets a cold precedent for honoring the history of this town
9294934 in this instance the staff believes that the benefits to the public health safety and welfare of the rezone are not sufficient to warrant rezoning the property
9294935 she is an applicant for the project like any other applicant in town
9294936 these are kids struggling with incredible difficulties all the time
9294937 heres a day they get to just be the center of attention and have fun
9294938 i dont know that as a 3 year old he really recognizes that kind of profound life change hes in the midst of
9294939 so this is an additional kind of tool to help him talk about that
9294940 it gives them an opportunity to see that people are thinking about them
9294941 that we care as a police department but also as dads and moms
9294942 everyone at the redmond police department has been really kind and caring
9294943 they made her happier then shes been in a long time
9294944 today is a kind of epiphany because we might have a solution for at least one state
9294945 i believe the 2001 roadless rule to be one of the most effective conservation measures of our time however conservation cannot endure if the people most affected by it dont support it
9294946 we are proud of the way we manage our own state lands and our own private lands
9294947 they own two out of every three acres in idaho
9294948 if you look at the substance its frankly not hugely different from the clinton rule of 2001 what is different is the messenger
9294949 in 2001 we had a democratic president telling idaho that 9 3 million acres of their landscape was going to be managed a specific way
9294950 as you know i do own my own jet but ive been having to fly back and forth to la pursuing my acting career now if im flying like twice in a month thats like 200 000 or 250 000 round trip so im back on american airlines right now
9294951 shout out to all my saudi arabian brothers and sisters and all my brothers and sisters from all the countries that have oil if you could all please send me some oil for my jet i would truly appreciate it
9294952 last week we had reese witherspoon and dustin hoffman and al pachino flying with us within a couple of days of each other
9294953 the uemoa emergency supply plan the west african gas pipeline project the emergency supply plan of the west africa power pool project the regional regulation project for the ecowas electricity sector and the implementation of the regional policy for access to energy services the establishment of a regional centre for renewable energy and energy efficiency and the implementation of the emergency specific plan of electricity supply for guinea bissau
9294954 estimates show theres more than enough renewables developments either up and running or in the pipeline to potentially meet the 10 per cent goal
9294955 the official said imagine the 2010 target as being part of a pie
9294956 he said small commercial projects were a small part of the pie but it would be big renewables schemes that took up the major share
9294957 they said that they would not hand them over to us because of the threat of terrorism
9294958 weve got the engineers to build the wind farms but its a difficult market because of the regulatory regime
9294959 we and others are making applications to the grid before we are certain the developments can be built
9294960 but a small change in behavior can make a big difference
9294961 id hate to have the store bagger ask do you want to double bag that and then be thinking about whether i want to spend the extra 20 cents
9294962 this storm has the potential for being a very dangerous storm

9294968 life on the page how the fiction james wood really likes works
9294969 those you might think would be allies other members of the loosely defined group of literary critics breaking new ground with studies that incorporate scientific theory and even in a few cases empirical method
9294970 the stick is that mainstream academics are going to feel more beleaguered and provincial and left out in the cold and the carrot is that theyre going to feel that heres something new to do
9294971 i think that ambitious young scholars graduate students and so forth will see something of glamour in here something that can motivate their studies
9294972 what this government has also done in that area as its done across the government is weve instituted an expenditure management system where over a period of five years we comprehensively review every program and we make sure that were spending on priorities and spending on those programs that are most effective
9294973 some programs in arts and culture have increased in funding others have gone down in total its gone up
9294974 the opposition has a view that you can never cut any single program ever if thats how they want to run the country youll have two consequences youll either have out of control spending or you will have a flat amount of program funding that is increasingly less effective over time
9294975 i dont think they listen with any degree of interest to the fact that the economic impact of the arts is demonstrably positive
9294976 to fall into the fallacy that its really about moving money around well it isnt
9294977 as a magnet for talent an enhancer of economic performance and a catalyst for prosperity
9294978 i was very nervous about beginning a blog as i didnt really know how to use it
9294979 pregnancy is already considered an aggravating factor we ask the canadian government to recognize that we are coping with two losses two deaths
9294980 we were pleased that bill c 484 introduced by conservative mp ken epp acknowledged the fact that we have to cope with two losses we had hope that it would bring recognition of our pain by the canadian judicial system
9294981 although we have not seen the text of the law we do not believe that what justice minister nicholson is proposing demonstrates any compassion for the ordeal our family has had to endure since we lost both aysun and gul we know in our hearts that most canadians understand the painful reality we have been going through over the past few months and we are deeply disappointed that the canadian government is not showing aysun and gul the respect they both deserved
9294982 we understand mr epps disappointment and are thankful for all the effort he has put forth in order to make a real difference in the lives of families who like ours were stripped of the right to share everyday life with a daughter sister or friend and with a grand daughter or grand son niece or nephew
9294983 our family invites all canadians to keep fighting for bill c 484 we urge them to show parliament that simply considering pregnancy as an aggravating factor is not sufficient canadian women and the families of canadian women who were victims of violence deserve better
9294984 does not provide for any charges to be laid in respect of the unborn child who is injured or dies as a result
9294985 how is it every time you refer to a fetus you call it

9294989 we are extremely vigilant in our day to day operations over possible illegal activities including money laundering
9294990 i have never seen anything like that in my life
9294991 a real test of a presidential candidates judgment is his choice of a running mate the person who is next in line to become the commander in chief as we face serious global challenges and wars in iraq and afghanistan john mccain has chosen someone with virtually no national security or foreign policy experience this choice calls into question both senator mccains judgment and a mccain administrations ability to lead a nation in crisis to the extent that this choice represents an effort to court supporters of hillary clintons historic candidacy mccain misjudges the reasons so many voters rallied around her candidacy it was senator clintons experience skill and commitment to change especially in the areas of health care and energy policy that drew such strong support sarah palins opposition to roe v wade and her support of big oil will not draw democrats from the obama biden ticket
9294992 maxwell street days never could and never will have anything near the flavor of the maxwell street market

9294995 one day men will look back and say i gave birth to the twentieth century
9294996 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security
9294997 every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not you move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed the only way you can survive is to spread to another area there is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern a virus human beings are a disease a cancer of this planet you are a plague and we are the cure
9294998 this is the mind of a maniac but we have a tight victim profile and powerful evidence that has taken us across the country

9295014 the authors quote four scholars attacking gov palins fitness for the office of vice president among them david kennedy is a maxed out obama donor joel goldstein is also an obama donor and doris kearns goodwin has donated exclusively to democrats this cycle finally matthew dallek is a former speech writer for dick gephardt this is not a story about scholars questioning governor palins credentials so much as partisan democrats who would find a reason to disqualify or discount any nominee put forward by senator mccain

9295034 my uncle martin would agree that we cannot end poverty hunger or suffering by killing those who might suffer
9295035 my uncle said that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere there is injustice in our land we have turned being unwanted into a crime penalized by death today i echo the words of dr martin luther king jr let freedom ring from every mountain top let freedom ring for all americans wanted and unwanted born and unborn
9295036 det k nns i ryggraden n r jag kommer h r l ngs v gen
9295037 det r en h rlig trakt och vi tre trivs bra ihop
9295038 theres a great sense of freedom in flying especially with the cf 18 jet
9295039 its a rollercoaster ride the planes are big toys for big boys
9295040 its also the 50th anniversary of our participation in norad north american aerospace defence command
9295041 i take a two hour lunch break every day when i practics my flying routine
9295042 this is an amazing piece of history that not everybody gets to see
9295043 this isnt the type of stuff you find in your history books or local library its a new way of looking at topeka and seeing images youve never had a chance to see
9295044 fresh eyes seeing history from a different point of view
9295045 the thing i saw most common is railroad stamps a lot of the mail went through the train cars
9295046 another thing is a lot of the handwriting at that time was very hard to read
9295047 they had a lot of calligraphy fancy writing sweeping letters and the age of the cards does affect the ink because it fades out quite a bit
9295048 we want people to get connected and get to talking
9295049 we get so seated in the way we live today we forget it wasnt always that way
9295050 it was the best of times it was the worst of times
9295051 the chinese electorate ensured that i got the 2 3 majority in 1999
9295052 exercise of coercive power by umno administrations both dr m and now his successors has had the side effect of empowering the islamist state apparat if today the christian flock particularly chinese were to complain of religious repression then they are only reaping what theyve sown
9295053 it is a far far better thing that i do than i have ever done it is a far far better rest that i go to than i have ever known
9295054 if it dont draw blood then it aint a sport
9295055 weve always had good berries and people come up here every year
9295056 we call them the bucket brigade because they come with their buckets and containers and spend an entire week collecting berries
9295057 i think in years past people were intimidated by the trails
9295058 we just had to think like the visitors to realize that there needed to be some direction
9295059 i like to pick them too but i like them when theyre dark like burgundy thats when theyre really good
9295060 and did you know that she anjanette was the grand champion at the alaska state fair for her blueberry cream cheese pie
9295061 that was two years ago and she used berries from sheep mountain
9295062 we do a sibling get together and this was what we chose to do this week we spent all day saturday doing the hot tub thing and staying inside because of the rain so we decided today to get out here and pick
9295063 we have people call all the time wanting to know if the berries are ripe yet
9295064 theyll call every single day and when they get ripe they get in their cars and get up here
9295065 i love this part of the trail because you have the whole road to yourself
9295066 we bring the dogs up here during training and can go all the way to gunsight mountain and beyond
9295067 you can come just to bike the trails but theyre not that long and some people might get bored
9295068 if youre looking for a really long day its nice to add this section
9295069 theres a lot of potential for things like a mountain run or natural history guided tours
9295070 if i can get here i can get to any of your events
9295071 it is all about making students feel welcome excited and motivated on the first day of school
9295072 i think most parents were really surprised to see the superintendent and all those officials
9295073 it was the smoothest opening in the four years that i have been here
9295074 we try to make it an exciting welcome for the kids
9295075 they say to themselves im gonna be on espn2 and that plays with their heads
9295076 its because its a family beach and mini golf is a wholesome family activity
9295077 you could argue that it all started at an amusement park in the 40s
9295078 sometimes the kids get it in their heads to use the clubs to break them
9295079 the only time ill get mad is when you disrespect me
9295080 there was this one guy who came in here and told me i had a chicken expletive little job
9295081 this moose made it across safely though several hundred other moose end up in collisions with vehicles on alaskas kenai peninsula causing injuries deaths and property damage
9295082 my only worry about governor palin had been what i would call a hysterical misreading of her views regarding the teaching of creationism in public schools but
9295083 palin would focus on helping americans achieve their dreams by staying out of their way
9295084 and unlike some female politicians such as hillary clinton palin made it herself without the help of a career politician husband to give her an added advantage
9295085 if i were with you i would rub your head
9295086 your blog is always sharp and punchy makes me wonder who are you in non blog life
9295087 feel that dean obama and the media gave hillary and women a raw deal in this election
9295088 wow sarah palin has managed to make me feel excited about this boring old man
9295089 i am especially proud to say in the week that we celebrate the anniversary of womens suffrage a devoted wife and a mother of five
9295090 if i were with you i would rub your head
9295091 your blog is always sharp and punchy makes me wonder who are you in non blog life
9295092 it is all about making students feel welcome excited and motivated on the first day of school
9295093 i think most parents were really surprised to see the superintendent and all those officials
9295094 it was the smoothest opening in the four years that i have been here
9295095 we try to make it an exciting welcome for the kids
9295096 to help job training and job placement for underprivileged people within our community
9295097 it was a huge success everybody seemed to have a really great time
9295098 reed college place restoration committee and urban forestry mature tree pruning workshop
9295099 we want people to think about branson as great place to bring families together
9295100 the drive to destinations will do better than the fly to ones like orlando
9295101 y ou cant eat grief its far too strong and indigestible you have to let the grief eat you you have to let the sorrow swallow you
9295102 and we have lived in peace since the great war five generations past
9295103 but we now know how to protect ourselves from the likes of them never will we let another clan play lord to us again nor trick us in our sleep
9295104 now tell us something of who you are exactly where do you come seen that you followed the river down from the eastern hills and how long do you intend to stay
9295105 thus far our peoples have met each other in the spirit of peace and cooperation
9295106 our forebears were the kings of these forests and river lands
9295107 i am absolutely delighted by this selection once again john mccain has shown that he is an independent thinker who paints in bold strokes sarah palin is a conservative reformer with executive experience who will bring a breath of fresh air to washington she will be an ideal running mate for john mccain and will make a major contribution to our countrys future
9295108 going back to the dynamic of the mccain campaign they want to shake it up and this is definitely something that will shake it up
9295109 wow sarah palin has managed to make me feel excited about this boring old man
9295110 if i were with you i would rub your head
9295111 your blog is always sharp and punchy makes me wonder who are you in non blog life
9295112 shanghai police will post photos and videos of jaywalkers in newspapers and on tv in a bid to shame them out of breaking traffic rules local media reported on thursday
9295113 offending pedestrians moped riders and cyclists would be snapped at selected intersections and their images put in regular columns and on special television programs set up by police the shanghai daily said
9295114 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9295115 and it is warm not something im really used to
9295116 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9295117 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me
9295118 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9295119 can step in and become president and i dont think anybody has any doubt about that
9295120 counsel and advice of somebody whos not going to agree with me 100 percent of the time
9295121 but for the rest of us theres still no change
9295122 we plan to start when were going to start and end when were going to end
9295123 right now it appears to have restored a leaner version
9295124 im not sure when well have it back up the way it was
9295125 and the presence of a former republican state representative andrew halcro on the ballot running as an independent
9295126 fortunately theres still time to get her on a flight to berlin so she can give a speech in europe
9295127 town of 9000 sneer unless you live in one of the three largest cities in the usa youre a dumb hick so obama had to be play by the harder rules but that experience makes him a more seasoned political actor than his minimal experience and meager legislative achievements would indicate
9295128 i cant imagine for the life of me why a liberal gay who certainly should be self assured and content in his life and lifestyle views should bother in the least to harass someone less informed than himself
9295129 i like gays everyone should have their hair done by one
9295130 and i wish wed get rid of the so called religious right
9295131 there are a lot of attractions there and a lot of open spaces its a wonderful park
9295132 the city bought the land hoping to get a state park
9295133 many organizations in the city were making the case that lubbock was a growing community that deserved the facilities and amenities that other cities around the state were getting
9295134 the ccc camp was organized not only to benefit lubbock
9295135 mackenzie is one of our higher use parks and its large enough to accommodate large crowds for special events such as the fourth on broadway
9295136 the lubbock ccc camp ran for a long time almost six years typically the camps were evaluated every six months on whether they were still necessary thats why its impressive lubbocks camp was here for six years from 1935 41
9295137 one other important aspect for lubbock was the park connected lubbock and its leaders to important state and national agencies
9295138 one of the other arguments for a state park was a lack of leisure sports not just in lubbock but on the south plains in general
9295139 people would come from as far as 100 miles away to swim there
9295140 man all this used to be in little old aurora and now in a few years all that may be in that spot are condominiums and or stores
9295141 it was nice to end with three birdies as its managed to keep me in a decent position heading to the last round
9295142 gregorys played well these three days and all credit to him but there is a lot of class players behind him and he will have a lot of pressure on his shoulders
9295143 ill need to get out of the blocks quickly and post some early birdies if i am going to have a chance
9295144 the good thing is that the weather doesnt look to be too good tomorrow whilst these greens are still causing a lot of frustration for everyone
9295145 it was a very frustrating day and i have played so much better to have had seven birdies but only be two under for the day
9295146 it was a nice finish and the conditions were a lot easier as their wasnt much wind out there today
9295147 it was nice to end with three birdies as its managed to keep me in a decent position heading to the last round

9295171 and i feel safe in predicting that within the next decade and possibly even within the next year we will be able to recover gold silver radium and all the other untold wealth from the sea
9295172 now that we have made one dream a reality it is only a matter of further technical development and refinement of processes before we make the sea loosen its hold on a fortune so fabulous that it staggers the imagination

9295222 rally new zealand last year produced the closest wrc finish in recent years and this year we have seen yet again an incredible twist on the final day
9295223 petter and phil did a solid job in what was a much more positive day for us their efforts were rewarded with a last minute leap to fourth position which goes some way to consoling what has overall been a tough weekend for the team chris similarly upped his pace this morning which was encouraging and weve certainly learned a lot from the testing he has carried out over the last couple of days
9295224 its been a tough rally for us but fourth place is good after this weekend
9295225 what an incredible finish the whaanga stage was like a scrap yard today the car felt the best it has this weekend so we are definitely making steps in the right direction but its taking a little time of course we are here for winning though so we have some more steps to take but we have to lift our heads now and keep working so we can start to fight at the front
9295226 ok this weekend has been tough for us especially after our third position on the last gravel rally in finland
9295227 its disappointing that we had to retire today we were testing some suspension components and under braking the car slid straight on and we nosed into a bank and damaged the radiator so that was it now we have a little gap to look at what we can do ahead of spain
9295228 i didnt want to load the gun but my stepfather was very mean he had shot up my brothers home the night before and took me with him he tried to shoot me too we were sitting in the car and he held this gun to my head and pulled the trigger when he did i moved his hand and he shot a hole inside the car that was the lifestyle we lived as long as i can remember
9295229 i learned that if you just go up and ask people for food theyre probably going to give it you
9295230 but there were times when i would sneak in peoples houses and take food off their table i remember doing it one morning when the people were in the other room getting ready for church i was taking the food and putting it in my shirt everything i could grab and i remember running out and sitting down behind the house and just eating everything
9295231 i just found myself hanging by myself for hours and hours just writing
9295232 it was so strange because i didnt mean for this to happen it had just become a habit
9295233 they put me in a detention center and i was in there with kids who had committed crimes and i was really scared ill never forget that night when i went in there was an officer and the way he talked to me i had been sleeping outside for two weeks at that point and he asked me darn boy how long has it been since youve taken a bath just the things he said to me were very hurtful theyd spray you like you were in a civil rights film just humiliating
9295234 theyre both passed away i was this rough kid i had my long hair and my faded tattoo there was a lot of times when i started doubting god and started wondering what was going on but something worked through them and changed my entire life i had nothing i didnt even have an address i was lost heading down the wrong road but when that family took me in it changed my life people dont even know who i am now that knew me then
9295235 music was a way for me to vent and i did it
9295236 for someone who was so shy i dont know how i ended up being able to sing in front of someone but i would sing at every event i could at every cookout at every wedding i didnt care if there were two people there
9295237 jimmy came into the office played me a couple of songs played good sang great looked terrible
9295238 jimmy says the deal is ive been told if i play this song for a label they will immediately throw me out
9295239 theres a lot of mystery to our business and there shouldnt be
9295240 its really just finding unique people and supporting their vision when we do our job right were providers im not of the school where you say we have to fix that that that and that if you have to fix that many things im not going to sign you im all about taking what people are about and making them bigger than life im not about changing them
9295241 its sometimes surreal because you wonder am i really that person
9295242 you look at yourself and you think about all the stuff thats happened and where you are now and you think man im probably the luckiest person in the world at the same time i really cant believe it
9295243 it was nice to end with three birdies as its managed to keep me in a decent position heading to the last round
9295244 gregorys played well these three days and all credit to him but there is a lot of class players behind him and he will have a lot of pressure on his shoulders
9295245 ill need to get out of the blocks quickly and post some early birdies if i am going to have a chance

9295248 it was a nice finish and the conditions were a lot easier as their wasnt much wind out there today
9295249 the greens were a little smoother so that made for a good scoring combination

9295256 ive heard the military have relaxed the regulations from a couple of members that are in there
9295257 i think if a person wants to get into the military with just saying that they are in the national alliance now that they can in 2008 with the declining number of troops i dont think they are as picky as they used to be
9295258 all the gang bangers all the blacks mexicans and white supremacists

9295268 fizemos uma boa partida mas ainda falhamos em detalhes soubemos aproveitar bem os contra ataques e para a pr xima partida teremos de caprichar ainda mais

9295277 when you have a group look at data you protect against bias you get more perspectives and this can lead to more reliable decisions
9295278 we want to bring visualization to a whole new audience
9295279 the conversation about the data is as important as the flow of data from the database
9295280 the interesting thing we noticed was that users kept trying to upload blog posts and entire books
9295281 its great that people can paste in a youtube video of cats
9295282 so why not a visual that gives you some insight into the sea of data that surrounds us i might find one thing someone else something completely different and thats where the conversation starts
9295283 many eyes is unusual because it takes advantage of the collective intelligence of a group to get more out of a data set
9295284 i wanted people to understand that you can take the same data and have it tell lots of different stories
9295285 violent deaths declined in the latter decades of the century its a slightly more optimistic view

9295291 some people go the whole nine yards and claim that its the daughters with the father other people are absolutely clear on the fact that the truth of this assertion is entirely unimportant as this kind of smear is what rethuglicans do and is needed to win other people suggest that this rumor was manufactured by rove even though it is clearly manufactured right on the pages of the daily kos

9295301 don was an acting teacher he taught acting and ive done my fair share of that not as much as him and not to his degree of expertise but that was our common ground we had really long not just a passing chitchat really long talks where we would sit down at a bar and have intense actor to actor conversations about the craft and all the different techniques that go into it it was a very unique relationship that i had with him and im going to miss that
9295302 we took a trip to london and saw a bunch of plays he dragged me to all his favorite art and book stores he was always looking for something and he had a hunger for the artistic
9295303 thats an overused word but not with him he was an actor he painted he sketched he did woodwork he was amazing
9295304 we would gravitate toward each other for lunch on the set together
9295305 and to watch him particularly when he met ruby his wife he changed she had such a wonderful effect on him
9295306 there was something uniquely american about him his experience his look his size
9295307 there was just something with him that was really truthful both with what he presented on screen and in life he will be missed
9295308 when someone who you work with and who you are close to passes suddenly you realize how short the time we have here is
9295309 putting something off because you think you have all the time in the world for it isnt necessarily true
9295310 i think any time spent with don was a plus
9295311 the greatest moments were ones the audience wont see but the private intimate moments don was one of those people who everyday along with the rest of our group we had a good laugh ill always remember his desire to get everything right and his inability to which was a frustration for him but it became a wonderful way to blow off steam and have a good laugh
9295312 don and i had started a project that we were going to write and produce together and his passing has reminded me of that pledge to do so so im going to make sure a movie called the maggie rose is produced and gets dedicated to him to do that movie in dons memory is something i look forward to
9295313 no one changes anyone else they merely open the doors
9295314 i want the president to do something its in his hands save mexico
9295315 the government needs to be aware that the population is fed up

9295317 we thank president hosni mubarak for opening the crossing today and we hope the opening days will be extended

9295336 it has been a disappointment that the canadian medical association has come out against my private members bill c 484 i believe physicians have unfortunately been influenced by a misinformation campaign as to the real intent of the unborn victims of crime act
9295337 after the cma announcement i requested and received the legal opinion which outlines the specific concerns outlined by the canadian medical association i have now had the opportunity to review that opinion
9295338 preliminary legal advice presented to me suggests that while c 484 ensures that no doctors could ever be in jeopardy of facing criminal charges as a result of this bill as it specifically excludes any and all elective abortions very modest amendments to the bill could and should eliminate any concerns physicians might have
9295339 the cma contacted me last week to arrange a meeting i was encouraged by cma president dr robert ouellets offer to meet i have accepted the offer and had hoped to meet with him tomorrow august 29

9295341 hopefully the announcement by minister nicholson earlier this week has not resulted in diminishing the cmas interest in pursuing a meeting
9295342 i am prepared to do everything i can to meet cmas concerns
9295343 it is also important that i respond to the countless everyday canadians who continue to contact me daily with expressions of support for c 484
9295344 i would also like to thank my parliamentary colleagues for their continued support for bill c 484

9295346 with the real estate market at a virtual standstill banks could not make realistic estimates of the value of the collateral that supported their assets and hence could not judge whether they themselves were still solvent caution accordingly dictated that bank lending to new customers be constrained and since banks dominated financial system the financial intermediation so vital to any large developed economy dried up deflationary forces took hold it was not until the long decline in real estate prices bottomed out that reasonable judgments of bank solvency were possible only then were new loans forthcoming producing a marked resurgence of economic activity

9295537 ich finde bereinstimmung bei dem befund dass wir von beiden seiten des atlantiks viel f r die erneuerung der beziehungen tun und klassische sicherheitspolitische themen erg nzen m ssen um fragen der klimaschutz und energiepolitik

9295545 the government is in a dilemma if they crackdown that may cause a boomerang but if they dont they look weak
9295546 if the president thought john mccain was going to be the next president he would think it more appropriate to let the next president make that decision than do it on his way out
9295547 palin is not ready to become president and we call on mccain to reconsider his vice presidential selection immediately
9295548 for mccain who will be 76 before the end of his term and has fought cancer never has it been more likely that a vice presidential choice would become president and never has a vice presidential choice been less qualified to do so
9295549 mccain chose an unknown running mate based on cynical political expediency rather than presidential qualities
9295550 but as for that vp talk all the time ill tell ya i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day

9295556 the baby was born on a monday and she returned to the office on tuesday
9295557 pushing a bill to make it tougher for conservation groups
9295558 yes its humbling but its also a responsibility weve taken on changing alaskas image
9295559 at first they had me in a bunch of furs yeah i have furs on my wall but i dont wear furs i had to show them my bunny boots and my north face clothing
9295560 when the conversation wrapped up he said yes would i like to join him in this and i said if i can help the country and if i can help you on the ticket absolutely i would be honored
9295561 i knew that that senator and i we would have sort of an inherent connection though with our mission being reform and putting the people first before any party or personal interest
9295562 i have known all along that he as such a maverick that we would have a connection but i didnt know that he knew enough about me to seriously be a consideration
9295563 alaska will be allowed to contribute more to our great country and they will be allowed to do that because i if elected i will be in a position of opening the eyes of the country to what it is that alaska is all about and what alaska has to offer
9295564 so im happy to and very honored to be asked to do this
9295565 er war so verwirrt dass er gleich wieder auf den platz laufen wollte

9295567 we could not accurately forecast river flows and water levels without the data and support we receive from the usgs
9295568 when river and tide data are not available our job of forecasting is much more difficult and typically results in diminished accuracy of those forecasts
9295569 we wish you well in life we should praise her she is our golden girl take care of her

9295589 these guys got a bad rap a few weeks ago for what happened but they dont deserve it
9295590 this one means a lot these guys have had a lot of adversity on them the past few weeks
9295591 i think the biggest challenge was just being good on the restarts and getting away
9295592 nobody was going to touch that no 18 those guys were scary fast it was a lot of fun but he was in a different zip code
9295593 tomorrow will be ours weve won two in a row and i believe our car will be real good

9295598 the operation in swat is in high gear but the holy months sanctity requires that people spend it in peace and harmony
9295599 ein kanal allein kann heute nicht mehr alle zielgruppen abdecken
9295600 als wir vor 12 jahren mit den digitalkan len gestartet sind gab es eine sehr geringe verbreitung es war also nicht klug dort viel zu investieren aber wir sind jetzt nicht mehr weit davon entfernt dass digitaler fernsehempfang standard wird und das ist eine gute chance unsere inhaltlichen angebote mit diesen zusatzkan len breiter aufzustellen
9295601 wir haben f r dokumentationen eine unserer ganz gro en st rken im hauptprogramm bei phoenix 3sat und arte hinreichend gute sendepl tze daf r ist kein eigener kanals mehr n tig
9295602 deshalb suchen wir jetzt f r den sender eine neue ausrichtung die f r den ein kanal sender zdf weitaus wichtiger ist ein abwechslungsreiches familienorientiertes programm f r das j ngere publikum
9295603 aber wir sehen dass wir mit einem kanal allein nicht mehr die ganze gesellschaft erreichen diese zeiten sind definitiv vorbei
9295604 k nftig m ssen wir unsere kompetenz unser programmverm gen und unseren sendeauftrag auf mehrere schultern verteilen
9295605 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9295606 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9295607 isnt it nice that they will do their little photo op from such a distance from the real action

9295610 we are in the process of talking to the government theyve not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us
9295611 there would be no more powerful way of making them feel part of the olympics would there
9295612 freerun is about risk and risk is all about calculating
9295613 you make a calculation with your body if you see a jump or a move that you feel you can do then you should do it even if you are scared if you are afraid and you dont make the move then you are letting fear beat you you have to overcome fear and be successful
9295614 people think we are daredevils who would go for everything or anything but we have fears like everyone else our fears keep us alive
9295615 our three routes to success are dedication determination and discipline and if you are lacking one of these elements then youre not going to get very far
9295616 i teach people how to crawl first because thats something we often forget as humans how to walk using our hands and feet together
9295617 we have a saying start low and start slow its very important because if you start big or start wild or start crazy then youll get hurt and youll be put of the game
9295618 i used to be one of the kids whod vandalize things and get into trouble with the police
9295619 ciaos success has been led by a team of talented people who took a unique combination of intuitive technology and the insight that comes out of their passionate consumer community to become one of europes leading shopping comparison sites
9295620 this makes the company a fantastic asset to the future of our search offer integrating ciaos capabilities into live search will provide a strong launchpad for our commercial search offer in europe and enhance our e commerce offering on msn
9295621 this accord opens the door to the future cooperation and partnership between italy and libya
9295622 it is a complete and moral acknowledgement of the damage inflicted on libya by italy during the colonial era
9295623 in this historic document italy apologizes for its killing destruction and repression against libyans during the colonial rule
9295624 i will not bow i will not step down and i will not resign despite the pressure mounting on my government
9295625 since the government cannot resolve the problem the joint session of parliament is the best choice for finding a solution
9295626 calls for the dispatch of additional osce observers to the security zone and setting up an impartial monitoring of the acts of the georgian government
9295627 of course will leave these positions where we are now we will not remain there forever
9295628 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying
9295629 but we expect certain sanctions which wont be against the people but against the political elite
9295630 we have long ago recognised the borders of modern day ukraine
9295631 agreed on the need to put an end to attempts to use the situation surrounding georgia to raise tensions in europe by speculating on non existent threats concerning other post soviet countries
9295632 i would not be surprised if this integration process would be going even quicker
9295633 i think there should be an adequate reaction by nato to russias incursion
9295634 people in leticia know i look after young monkeys that have been orphaned or wounded
9295635 obviously youre helping the monkeys in your care but has your work any significance for the rest of the amazons monkey populations
9295636 yielded many useful findings not least that swift and decisive action to mitigate climate change is
9295637 as economic analysis the stern review dwells in a non scientific state of limbo
9295638 i was appalled at how flimsy the case is i was also appalled at the behaviour of many of those who helped produce the ipcc reports and by many of those who promote it
9295639 in particular i am referring to the arrogance the activities aimed at shutting down debate the outright fabrications the mindless defense of bogus science and the politicisation of the ipcc process and the science process itself
9295640 the awful weather clearly has something to do with this hibernation hysteria
9295641 however with gas and electric companies turning up the heat it looks like many people will be turning to their wardrobe rather than the central heating thermostat this winter to keep warm
9295642 i suppose its a reluctant thanks to jake ulrich as well a full set of debenhams long johns and a couple of our woolly jumpers are in the post so he can follow his own advice
9295643 it speaks well for our institutions consciousness in preventing an otherwise needless waste
9295644 whenever theres a bunch of people here at one time it gets crazy you have people bumping into you so if youre balancing stuff youre going to end up dropping something or breaking something
9295645 so if a college is looking to go green they need to start looking in the dining facility
9295646 its going faster in some places than others because you have different cultures and different ways that universities do things
9295647 the improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority as such for him scepticism is the highest of duties blind faith the one unpardonable sin
9295648 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
9295649 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
9295650 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child
9295651 the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane
9295652 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added
9295653 the withdrawal of british and irish buyers from the bulgarian market was prompted by the financial crisis in their countries but also by the bad infrastructure and the excess of concrete here
9295654 a decline in speculative investment will have a sanitising effect on the economy
9295655 more and more often we come to a point where we see how money that we have reasons to believe came from is wired through foreign banks and returned here in the form of investment
9295656 we cannot let the situation in the country go on like this
9295657 it must be over but i will not do anything that will create a bad atmosphere the announcement of an emergency decree would create a bad atmosphere in the country and to the world
9295658 what they are trying to do now is overthrow the government
9295659 they seized airports is this democracy or is this the peoples alliance to destroy democracy
9295660 we are worried that the pad will come here so we are here to protect the people
9295661 i told you before that i will not resign i will stay on to run this country
9295662 i dont think that just reaching that number in and of itself has that much meaning
9295663 the shrine board will now exclusively use the land during the pilgrimage period
9295664 we are suspending the agitation for now as our main demand has been met
9295665 the proprietary status ownership and title of the land shall not undergo any change
9295666 a few particles down the transfer line from the super proton synchrotron sps accelerator to the lhc
9295667 thanks to a fantastic team both the clockwise and counterclockwise tests went without a hitch
9295668 we look forward to a resounding success when we make our first attempt to send a beam all the way around the lhc
9295669 i believe in our quality and i think we got our fans back with this performance
9295670 when we all play together like that and show our spirit we have a chance to win
9295671 it was very important to show that if we play like this we have a lot of chances to win something
9295672 ive been around long enough to know that when the vultures are around it gets difficult
9295673 ive never had it before but you just have to deal with it id rather it was directed at me than the players
9295674 jermain was great the goals were two excellent bits of skill from a top class striker
9295675 we worked hard on our system all week and getting this result should give the players a lot of belief
9295676 doesnt even what is thought of as empty space interstellar space occupy a relationship between a position in timespace a relativity isnt it actually teeming with energies
9295677 thiago neves ist ein junger spieler der in brasilien f r viel aufsehen gesorgt hat nicht nur national sondern auch in der copa libertadores thiago wird mit seiner kreativit t und seiner abschlussst rke wichtige impulse f r unser offensivspiel setzen
9295678 ill tell you one thing you enjoy winning you kidding me
9295679 ill kick their butt tomorrow well get up tomorrow and learn those lessons
9295680 were better than that and we cant make the mistakes we made and get behind a team of that caliber and expect to be able to come back
9295681 weve got fast receivers on the outside and we took advantage of it
9295682 its a scary moment when an impact player like that goes down
9295683 it would mean a lot for us to win on a big track like this downforce tracks have been kind of our weak spot this year weve been making a lot of gains hopefully we made some gains that will help us this weekend and moving into the chase
9295684 last year it just started the confidence in our minds that were ready for the chase youre looking at what you need to do to be as good as you can in the chase and building the confidence around yourself and the team that you can be a contender
9295685 winning here last year just kind of cemented those confident thoughts in place and we rolled it from here into richmond international raceway host of next weeks race and won again on a track thats been very challenging to us over the years
9295686 i think the fact that jgrs kyle busch and roushs carl edwards have been stronger than us makes me fall more into the thoughts and the ways that ive won the championships in the past
9295687 it puts more confidence in my abilities and what weve done in the past is a road map to a championship
9295688 our team has been phenomenal this year we just havent had the runs havent had the cars and when we did have the cars havent been able to put it all together so thats definitely been frustrating
9295689 were doing everything we can right now to win races every single weekend
9295690 we just need to put ourselves in position to make sure things go our way to get those laps led and get the victory thats our priority and has been our priority since february and still is thats all you can do because thats whats going to lead you to the championship
9295691 it shows a lot about our football team that we dug ourselves a pretty big hole against a good football team and we came out of it
9295692 presbyterian is a good team and they are going to win a lot of football games one of the big things for us was we made some adjustments defensively and basically told the guys to settle down and play your technique
9295693 i think offensively on the line of scrimmage we started to create some space and got the ball inside and outside then took it straight at them we had some big pass plays and i was pleased with the ways our kids got after it
9295694 a lot of people may choose that they dont want to take a risk they know how quickly weather can change and that may discourage a lot of travelers from traveling any distance this weekend
9295695 we want to get home before the contra flow starts
9295696 a lot of cancellations were going on but its now picking up
9295697 walked with god then he was no more for god took him
9295698 they got a bad rap a few weeks ago that they didnt really deserve and im glad to get this one for them
9295699 i think the biggest challenge was just being good on the restarts and getting away
9295700 nobody was going to touch that no 18 those guys were scary fast it was a lot of fun but he was in a different zip code
9295701 tomorrow will be ours weve won two in a row and i believe our car will be real good
9295702 i think today he still has the same shoes that he had from the first of this year
9295703 he has this fetish about his shoes it seems like he was pretty mad that someone had stolen his shoes out of his locker and he was head huntin for the person that stole his shoes and wanted them pretty much fired i think is a polite way to put it
9295704 we took the shoes over to kenseths motorhome matt put them on and we took pictures of them and then put this thing up on ebay we had control of it the whole time little did he know that we were the ones that stole his shoes
9295705 i just think that is probably the coolest story about jeff burton is he didnt give up he is back on top and he does deserve a championship he has been there and done that
9295706 in our stable i think he is probably the strongest force we have right now he has definitely pushed me to be better i think kevin can say the same thing every day you try to make yourself to keep up with both of your teammates but when you have one that is as old as he is and he is whoopin up on you out on the racetrack something is wrong just a lot of fun
9295707 kevin came along at the most crucial time in 2001 after dale earnhardt was killed at daytona and really helped keep us going
9295708 when we hired jeff he was the hardest driver in practice or anywhere on the race track he is driving that car as hard as he can you know you are getting everything out of it in practice testing or wherever
9295709 that is the kind of driver he is and that is the kind of driver i like couple of people said when i was thinking about hiring him why would i want to hire him i watch all these different guys drive these race cars and he drives every lap whether he is running 15th or 20th or wherever you can believe he is getting everything out of the car it will do
9295710 carls like the good guy kyle would be the bad guy
9295711 two totally different personalities but i think the fans respect what they are on track and what theyre doing
9295712 i think that both are respected as hard nose drivers
9295713 i think kyle is winning more fans over here lately by his success and being able to win in any type of car
9295714 i think carl has that same thing going for him running the nationwide series full time like he does and the success he has there theyre certainly different guys
9295715 were all really doing the same thing were all racing as hard as we can every race there have been races where i was so mad and so angry afterwards and there are races where youre happy it just kind of depends on how everything falls as to what hat youre wearing that day
9295716 i hope to be in there and have people talking about three guys here pretty soon and be the pc politically correct guy which i guess ive been labeled for whatever damn reason i can get in there and spin people out too
9295717 do you know youre in the middle of the road
9295718 um yes all my tires are popped im trying to call a tow truck

9295728 sure hes really fast and when he posted a 1 084 yard seven touchdown 2004 season he looked legit but since then he has done nothing but tick off coaches with bad effort and crummy route running
9295729 ill say this again players 46 61 on our roster are all practice squad players since we can only dress 45 on game day so to me all that really matters is our top 45
9295730 i am happy to say that in the last four years we have accomplished much in keeping with our commitments
9295731 in our national action for skill development we would like to set for the country an ambitious goal of 500 million of trained people by 2020 in keeping with sonia gandhis vision of rozgar badhao

9295765 and steak lovers cravings are being satisfied in more ways
9295766 its the only way to do it and the beef is hands down superior to that aged any other way if dried properly even choice can be as good or even better than prime
9295767 it has a green taste thats hard for many diners to appreciate to the point of being offensive
9295768 if you dont enjoy a richer well marbled ribeye or strip steak then dry aged beef wouldnt be something you would appreciate
9295769 beef has to age to have enhanced tenderness characteristics what this means to supermarkets is that somewhere along the system weve got to build in an aging system
9295770 this study shows that the retail marketer has as important a role as the producer in making beef more tender
9295771 when all segments work together we can come closer to providing the consumer with a highly desirable consistently tender product
9295772 the idea for this research program originated with beef producers
9295773 its an example of how the beef checkoff program works at the grassroots level to make our industry better for all beef producers

9295780 n r man er p vej mod rets f rste kamp og man er i en situation som os i forhold til kickeren s er den vigtigste prioritet at det er en rutineret spiller

9295796 our operations against them are continuing even through the ramadan
9295797 there is no instruction for us to stop our offensive against the groups of bravo and kato we cannot delay enforcement of laws

9295810 the researchers did not set out to redraw the image of pre colonial north american landscapes as they embarked on a field study with a group of undergraduate students they expected to collect data on how farmlands were contributing to land erosion however in the first stream they visited they found layer upon layer of fine silt which suggested that the sediment was in fact quite old they searched around and found a mill and a dam every new site they visited was the same
9295811 thats more money than we raised in the fourth quarter of 2007
9295812 we cannot let the situation in the country go on like this
9295813 it must be over but i will not do anything that will create a bad atmosphere the announcement of an emergency decree would create a bad atmosphere in the country and to the world
9295814 what they are trying to do now is overthrow the government
9295815 they seized government offices airports is this democracy or is this the peoples alliance to destroy democracy
9295816 we are worried that the pad will come here so we are here to protect the people
9295817 i told you before that i will not resign i will stay on to run this country
9295818 we should continue to strengthen the transatlantic relationship and may need to meet more regularly as the g7
9295819 i believe russia faces a choice about the nature of its responsibilities as a leading and respected member of the international community
9295820 my message to russia is simple if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the g8 oecd and wto you must accept that with rights come responsibilities
9295821 we want russia to be a good partner in the g8 and other organisations but it cannot pick and choose which rules to adhere to
9295822 the uk will go from being 80 per cent self sufficient now to having to import almost two thirds of our gas and more than half of our oil by 2020 precisely as markets become more volatile as more people chase fewer natural resources
9295823 and with states such as russia increasingly using their energy resources as policy tools it is apparent that the security grounds for this shift are stronger as well
9295824 without urgent action we risk sleepwalking into an energy dependence on less stable or reliable partners
9295825 it is better to focus on specific individuals rather than across the board measures against ordinary citizens
9295826 it could be that we put in visa bans for officials from south ossetia and abkhazia and the kremlin linked russians who are active down there
9295827 unlike soviet leaders the russian political elite today have a lot to lose
9295828 they keep their money in the uk and the united states they send their kids for education there they send their wives for shopping they travel with their families for vacations
9295829 russia should be given a clear choice either they continue to be part of the west and enjoy that or they will have personal problems in terms of money and benefits it will work
9295830 it will be the lowest common denominator because countries have sharply differing attitudes to russia the brits poles and baltics states want to be tough the italians are effectively supporting russia and the french and germans are somewhere in between
9295831 if the uk financial authorities probed a lot of those dealings rigorously i am sure they could make the russian elite feel very uncomfortable
9295832 there is a great need to reconstruct eu energy policy and create a proper internal energy market
9295833 its like a 9 minutes technical plant visit you dont see the oil but at least you learn something about the basic process perhaps later we can have more of this type video technical plant visit to enrich our technical skills
9295834 thats what they call that type of pumping facility to pump out the petroleum we took samples from it and tested the samples with our demulsifier and descaler chemical resins

9295842 you cant have that happening what i would have done is set a deadline of three weeks before the window closes the later it gets the harder it is to replace the player who has gone you are almost left with what you can get
9295843 they have not built when you are building a house you start with strong foundations and tottenham have not done that that has been the case for the last six years
9295844 i thought martin jol was going to get that time you need but that wasnt to be for whatever reason now it is important that juande ramos is given the chance to finish the job he has started i cant see the value of getting ramos out during this season or at the end of it
9295845 they are the foundations of the team it is vital for tottenham this season that they stay fit
9295846 because this is the first time an african american has gotten this close to being president of the united states
9295847 and because he did it now you know you can do it too
9295848 you learned about him in school in february for a whole month dr king
9295849 but its always disappointing when youre not going to win you come in to every event wanting to win thats not going to happen this week so youve got to focus on next week
9295850 theres always next week its not like the olympics we dont have to wait four years
9295851 i found out it wasnt with about 5 6 holes to go
9295852 when i got to 6 under my caddie told me you need to get to 7
9295853 i just played the same way i played all day youve just got to go for it
9295854 its a lot easier to play golf like that its easier when theres no downside to an aggressive shot

9295921 this was the eraserheads this was our eraserheads reunion 2nd set because this was just us everyone in the room sang it didnt matter who was at the mic the band was just there to assist everyone to purge all feelings memories and to commemorate the greatness that is the eraserheads and the gig was such a contrast to the fort stage no state of the art stage production raims and buddy didnt even have their complete instrument set up there was no 5 meter barricade from the artists there were only a about at the most 200 hundred people in the crowd free beer getting served there were no svip sections no security guys no swanky buffet food no press but there we were shouting tang ina to pare ko singing tito vic and joey with aia on spolarium doing our lalalala la las to el bimbo

9295980 there are about 1 000 government supporters they call pad a political mafia and argue that this government was elected they say they are trying to uphold the principles of democracy so the prime minister has been thrown something of a lifeline
9295981 we cannot let the seizure of government house continue indefinitely without taking action
9295982 since the government cannot resolve the problem even the courts cannot resolve the problem the joint session of parliament is the best choice for finding a solution
9295983 the phuket security must be reviewed they have been trained to handle terrorists but what happens how have they allowed these people to encroach on the runway

9296005 i think the economy is having a significant impact on peoples decision to both retire or needing to come back to the work force
9296006 seventy percent of boomers plan on staying in the workplace beyond traditional retirement age 65 also its a reinvention of reitrement that will include working
9296007 you are working and you arent getting anywhere this is america you want the american dream
9296008 its like the american dream is turning into the american nightmare
9296009 we plan to keep on working until her debts are paid i went back to work full time from part time and it is helping but it is still difficult
9296010 our daughter is looking at smith college she wants to go into engineering these schools are 35 000 to 40 000 a year
9296011 we werent getting raises where i work and my husband hasnt gotten a raise and the price of things have gone up theres not enough for anything extra
9296012 when asked why they were working past 65 many said it was because of health care and money in terms of downturns of the economy the only other time when this was an issue was the late 1990s when the stock market was plummeting so many peoples pensions are driven by the stock market
9296013 theres a difference between taking it at 62 and 65 but i cant run the risk of not being able to survive until im 66
9296014 im 62 this january being independently employed i need to put away for taxes my income was getting less and less all the time i needed all of it to pay bills i have to be very careful in planning everything
9296015 i dont know where i stand i dont make myself sick over worring about the future and god willing something always happens to get me by
9296016 to be honest when massachusetts regulations came out with mandatory health care that put a crimp in things i worked for many years without health coverage

9296018 bleibt nur zu hoffen dass die medien nicht zur belastung werden
9296019 its like being in a franchise without dealing with the overburdening fees
9296020 its not a franchise because were taking them under our wing
9296021 that really gives me the ability to act like a 4 billion company
9296022 in my 20 years in the business he has hands down the best back office and systems support
9296023 im sure hed say he was just doing his job
9296024 but he was more than instrumental in saving seven lives he was the calm in the eye of the storm its one thing to have the skills but its quite another to execute them
9296025 relying on his special training stamina and courage he remained in 63 degree water for 45 minutes until all seven survivors were safely hoisted aboard the rescue helicopter by his courageous and prompt actions in the face of great personal risk hubble prevented the loss of seven lives
9296026 when i am up in the sky i own the back of the helicopter
9296027 we train everyday physically and mentally for any situation that might happen we prepare for the worst case scenario and that night was one of the worst it all happened so fast you just do what you have to do i am glad everyone made it out alive

9296029 canadians are very frustrated by the lack of offerings they have in canada
9296030 when you shopped online it was in u s dollars and then you would get the bill and there would be a big surprise
9296031 this allows companies to show customers what it is really going to cost us
9296032 the canadian marketplace is so underserved that if you can find the people who are appropriate for your offering youll have great success
9296033 probably the biggest challenge has been the size of our area of operations
9296034 and to answer how weve overcome that challenge i summed it up in one word marines
9296035 we want them to become a more proficient respectable and legitimate force which is really an extension of the government on the district level
9296036 we cant always have the right amount of recruits out of each district so we have to recruit from other districts
9296037 when they go through the training and come back those anp have an expectation that they are going to go back to the district they came from and sometimes we cannot do that
9296038 the solution isnt going to be so much the numbers of people that you bring in here it is the effect on the people that we have in the context of doing our mission which is i call it turning four into 40
9296039 the bottom line is we want to give these people liberty
9296040 to create conditions where they can take responsibility of their own affairs and provide for their own future
9296041 basically were going to let the iraqi security forces take control
9296042 were going to stick by their side but we want the iraqi face to be on everything happening
9296043 were going to continue educating them as we go over
9296044 well teach them all the things that will combine to make us win
9296045 it doesnt get any easier and kids make it sadder
9296046 it has not been resolved and i consider this problem will only be resolved through dialogue and negotiation
9296047 there is no possibility of resuming dialogue all the doors are closed and the only possibility which leftist basque nationalists have is to convince the eta terrorist group to lay down its weapons
9296048 the drum clinics are starting to shape up as i have two tentative dates at the present
9296049 i am accepting other recording projects as well as i have a good time working on various styles of music my is officially up and running and will have all of the clinic dates posted
9296050 it is truly an honor and privilege to be part of lpd 17s maiden deployment
9296051 when i look back at the accomplishments and effort by the crew getting the first ship in the san antonio class warship ready i am proud and humbled at the same time
9296052 the operational flexibility of our strike group is greatly enhanced by san antonios capabilities
9296053 its multi functional design supports technological advances in landing craft aircraft and amphibious vehicles the ship has a state of the art command and control suite more than double the storage space of the ships it replaces and advanced survivability features that enhance its ability to operate in the littoral environment
9296054 its ironic that my first deployment is the first for the san antonio also
9296055 ive waited for this moment for a long time to visit places in the world that i dreamed of seeing as a kid
9296056 i wanted to help see this ship get underway to show that the blood sweat and tears from its crew both past and present have paid off
9296057 the ship demonstrated flawless execution of procedures for getting underway and conducted a highly efficient onload of marines and their equipment i fully expect to see the same excellence from san antonio and its crew throughout deployment

9296067 i think that he has always been an individual rights person on the second amendment
9296068 obama has always expressed a belief that the second amendment guarantees a private right to bear arms
9296069 said consistently that i believe that the second amendment is an individual right and that was the essential decision that the supreme court came down on
9296070 one other issue thats of great importance here in the district as well is gun control but you support the d c handgun ban
9296071 he also opposed letting people use a self defense argument if charged with violating local handgun bans by using weapons in their homes the bill was a reaction to a chicago area man who after shooting an intruder was charged with a handgun violation
9296072 we just knew we wanted to do something completely different
9296073 after seeing her in morvern callar i knew i wanted her
9296074 we never wanted to make a biopic or even a music film
9296075 its important to understand that these were a bunch of 22 year old guys
9296076 i dont think anyone sets out to make world class music i think its something youre able to do or youre not
9296077 itll be the largest storm to approach the gulf coast and the united states since hurricane katrina in 2005
9296078 we just finished a two hour video teleconference with state and local officials to talk about the preparations we have in place in advance of hurricane gustav
9296079 there have been phenomenal improvements at the local level the state level and the federal level that we will benefit from
9296080 all states are talking to each other planning together sharing resources and working together as a team
9296081 since hurricane katrina hit in 2005 the new orleans hurricane damage reduction system is stronger than it was pre katrina
9296082 we will continue to respond for department of defense support in anticipation of landfall
9296083 they are provided with situational awareness and provided with prepare to deploy orders if needed
9296084 first in flight 43rd in moving over to the right so others can pass
9296085 best game to teach drunk people who asked for a game that requires no thinking
9296086 this is a real landmark agreement and a red letter day for the queensland coal industry and the resources sector generally
9296087 i dont think youd get many times a combination of local government and state government and industry coming together to agree to work on managing growth in this sector growth for decades to come
9296088 most queenslanders believe that when you are saying you have 10 300 beds in queensland you actually do have 10 300 beds in queensland you dont have hundreds of chairs and trolleys which actually count as beds
9296089 this is nothing new this is nothing startling in fact they were counted that way when the opposition were last in power back in the mid 90s
9296090 the rudd government has just talked about a review and then a further review that is not good enough

9296100 whenever theres a bunch of people here at one time it gets crazy you have people bumping into you so if youre balancing stuff youre going to end up dropping something or breaking something
9296101 any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon
9296102 but refineries have cut back production to keep prices up even as gasoline consumption falls
9296103 most people remember the gasoline price spike after katrina but not everyone realized back then that oil prices went up only 10 after the storm while gas was up 50
9296104 some of the pics points register as obvious and infuriating at once hardest hitting are the passages that point to oil execs use of 9 11 and hurricane katrina to post record profits and to their strategies twice defended before congress of reducing domestic refinery capacity by way of pumping up revenue

9296111 rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches are possible over florida keys and extreme southern florida additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are possible over the cayman islands isolated tornadoes are possible tonight over the florida keys and the southern florida peninsula
9296112 in the past our engineers have ridden to war in the back of a dump truck
9296113 where do we want the marine corps to be in 2020 with its vehicle complement based on what we think the threat will be at that point
9296114 weve got some good reports in recent weeks and months on the progress of efv
9296115 we certainly want to mate with the army on any program for the joint light tactical vehicle but i think its fair to say both services are still waiting for that technological breakthrough thats going to give us the amount of soldier and marine protection in a vehicle that is lighter than whats on the market right now
9296116 there is just not an apparent technological breakthrough in ceramics or in carbon fiber thats going to give us that lightweight technology that gives equal protection
9296117 were going to try to sort out just what that vehicle needs to look like

9296120 were facing what could be a very strong hurricane possibly one of the largest and strongest to hit america since records began
9296121 the rain is not so intense but there is a lot a lot of wind
9296122 the officials they have told us the wind will be bad first but then the rain could cause flooding into the night
9296123 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9296124 i must tell you this is the mother of all storms
9296125 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving and out of new orleans right now
9296126 the rain is not so intense but there is a lot a lot of wind
9296127 the officials they have told us the wind will be bad first but then the rain could cause flooding into the night
9296128 gulf of mexico and northern gulf coast should closely monitor the progress of gustav
9296129 a hurricane watch could be issued for portions of the northern gulf coast later today
9296130 things werent really as bad as they could have been
9296131 turning maybe purple in the state means to me its more independent its not the obsessive partisanship that gets in the way of doing whats right for this state and i think on a national level thats what were gonna see
9296132 thats why mccain is the candidate for the g o p because hes been known as the maverick as the conduit for some change
9296133 i always looked at senator mccain just as a joe blow public member looking from the outside in
9296134 hes been buttin heads with republicans for years and thats a healthy place to be
9296135 the vice president of the united states shall be president of the senate but shall have no vote unless they be equally divided
9296136 if at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the president the president elect shall have died the vice president elect shall become president
9296137 in case of the removal of the president from office or of his death or resignation the vice president shall become president

9296143 your son isnt heading off to fight the drug cartels in the jungles of colombia
9296144 europe with a eurail pass is about as safe as independent travel gets
9296145 traveling with a bunch of americans isnt necessarily going to make him much safer but it will make him stand out more and have a less cultural experience
9296146 with less stuff and only a backpack worn on your front in very crowded areas youve got your hands free are more mobile and have less to steal
9296147 allow for taxi rides food and souvenirs for the day but always leave some behind safely secured at your hotel
9296148 he went to italy with the knowledge of the f o in order to develop his contacts he greatly exceeded his instructions
9296149 he is a man with somewhat unusual views about the terms on which peace should be made with hitler
9296150 he thinks the world should be divided up into german and british spheres of influence the germans being given a more or less free hand in europe
9296151 although there seems to be a good deal to be said for locking him up to prevent him airing his views if this is done it will inevitably involve his bringing up the question of his contacts with the foreign office

9296171 i come from a metal family i have a cousin who was in type o negative so it was kind of in my dna
9296172 i think a lot of it is the old literary standby of dark and light and good and evil
9296173 i like to paint in broad strokes so that people can apply their own experiences to it it is a concept record thematically in that all the songs deal with temptation and redemption
9296174 neil young is the obvious example constantly doing whatever he wanted to do and following his muse wherever it led him

9296187 the sad part is theyre used to that kind of suffering
9296188 its another hurricane and they brace themselves but like it happens so often and they have to go through so much you know the hardship of their daily life and then this you know people lose their homes they lose their crops its really sad

9296204 that was the largest deployment of state to state aid in history and stands as a testament to emacs effectiveness and efficiency
9296205 this is the right thing to do our men and women are highly trained for these tasks and our delaware national guard troops are ready to help if american lives are at risk and our assistance is called upon
9296206 we are just entering the historically active part of hurricane season
9296207 although tropical storm fay did not produce damaging high speed winds that a category 3 or 4 hurricane would have the resulting flood waters required a significant state response that was a very good tune up for our emergency response team
9296208 the public got to see the national guard at work guard members and vehicles moving from armories to affected communities providing assistance to people in distress
9296209 we are able meet our mission requirements by preparing sufficient numbers of guardsmen to meet any anticipated weather event
9296210 we have a great deal of recent experience and know that when one weather event has passed we could have another on the horizon it is critical to our long term success to have enough capable people available who are also rested and motivated
9296211 the reason we do that is to be able to cooperate with state agencies and local authorities
9296212 the guard has continuous contact and coordination with the florida division of emergency management in tallahassee and our joint emergency operations center and planning cells ensure the capability to rapidly build up personnel and equipment if needed
9296213 a woman swathed in black to her ankles wearing a headscarf or a full chador walks down a european or north american street surrounded by other women in halter tops miniskirts and short shorts she passes under immense billboards on which other women swoon in sexual ecstasy cavort in lingerie or simply stretch out languorously almost fully naked could this image be any more iconic of the discomfort the west has with the social mores of islam and vice versa ideological battles are often waged with womens bodies as their emblems and western islamophobia is no exception when france banned headscarves in schools it used the hijab as a proxy for western values in general including the appropriate status of women when americans were being prepared for the invasion of afghanistan the taliban were demonised for denying cosmetics and hair color to women when the taliban were overthrown western writers often noted that women had taken off their scarves but are we in the west radically misinterpreting muslim sexual mores particularly the meaning to many muslim women of being veiled or wearing the chador and are we blind to our own markers of the oppression and control of women
9296214 how on earth do they get away with it lets start with war between hizbollah and israel past and future war that is
9296215 this storm is so powerful and grows even more powerful every day that i dont think we have any idea with what we are dealing now you have to be scared you have to be concerned you have to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now
9296216 i came back and moved in to the east of new orleans now i got to leave again this time im not coming back i cant come back its too stressful
9296217 i like these concerts the artists are role models for young people
9296218 that openness can only continue if there is an exposure to cultures from the rest of the world
9296219 its part of the kings project for society thats why you see a festival in nearly every town
9296220 there are too many festivals in morocco as soon as one finishes another starts no wonder young people dont read anymore
9296221 its like ancient rome bread and circus to keep the masses happy
9296222 nous ne sommes pas au moment de la d signation du pr sidentiable mais du premier secr taire pour nous cest pierre moscovici et nous souhaitons aller vers un large rassemblement qui commence par nos deux contributions pour le congr s ndlr et qui puisse inclure martine aubry

9296226 ce qui compte cest une ligne r formiste pour pr senter un projet ambitieux mais aussi r aliste
9296227 cherishing a french sensitivity to timbre and instrumental gesture a love of order in short the whole debussy stravinsky outlook that shaped not only lutoslawski but us
9296228 i know hillary clinton hillary clinton is a friend of mine and governor youre no hillary clinton
9296229 senator i know your running mate barack obama and hes no hillary clinton either

9296234 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 per cent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
9296235 als ik d r succes kan hebben dan kan het overal
9296236 ik neem jullie je kinderen af en jullie zeggen gezegend zijn wij jullie moeten wel goed gek zijn om in mij te geloven wij lachen hier wat af met jullie gebeden
9296237 het zuiden dat is ons bachten de kupe alleen veel groter
9296238 als ik songs schrijf moet ik iets uit de lucht grijpen en word ik gauw depressief als het niet wil vlotten bij een filmscore of een musical kan ik echter binnen een bepaald raam werken en heb ik dan ook vooraf al een idee van wat ik moet doen en hoe lang het moet worden toch ben ik niet het prototype van iemand die in groep kan werken daarvoor heb ik te lang alleen gewerkt en mijn eigen methodes ontwikkeld een ander belangrijk verschil is natuurlijk dat ik in zon geval voor een orkest moet schrijven wat voor mij geen alledaagse bezigheid is maar ik hou er wel van de partijen voor de strijkers of de blazers dat soort werk doe ik graag ik zou er bijvoorbeeld nooit aan denken om zoals vangelis synthesizers te gebruiken in chariots of fire daarom ben ik juist zo gesteld op grote ouderwetse films zoals a passage to india of out of africa of ragtime jawel ik zeg niet dat er geen betere films zijn maar ik kies mijn films op basis van het belang dat aan de muziek wordt gehecht en natuurlijk ook op het type van muziek dat vereist wordt maar komedies interesseren me doorgaans niet three amigos was een uitzondering omdat ik ook meegeschreven heb aan het scenario en ik zelfs even in de film mocht optreden als zingend struikgewas
9296239 its one thing to have been diagnosed with cancer when you know youre in your 40s or 50s like i was
9296240 but the raw injustice of a young person being diagnosed when theyve got their whole life ahead of them is something different altogether
9296241 our opponents will privatise essential services take us down the uranium path force gm foods onto us
9296242 our soldiers and airmen are staged and set to deploy to our coastal parishes without hesitation
9296243 engineer and communications teams are reporting to coastal parishes and are set to assist our citizens and local parish emergency responders our security forces are deploying to ensure safety and security of homes and personnel we are confident in our plans and ability to execute those plans on a moments notice
9296244 the primary function of these teams will be damage assessment
9296245 our soldiers and airmen are staged and set to deploy to our coastal parishes without hesitation
9296246 engineer and communications teams are reporting to coastal parishes and are set to assist our citizens and local parish emergency responders our security forces are deploying to ensure safety and security of homes and personnel we are confident in our plans and ability to execute those plans on a moments notice
9296247 the primary function of these teams will be damage assessment
9296248 we do a lot of humanitarian relief missions but this is definitely worthwhile what the c 5 is doing in delivering these items
9296249 we are trying to help as many people as we can by giving them what they need
9296250 good of the air force capability is being used to help the people of georgia
9296251 we are bringing the supplies they need to help survive and save lives over there
9296252 look i think her chances are actually very good i mean this is literally the watershed election
9296253 it will be close there are many candidates running if you vote green or independent thats exactly what kevin rudd wants
9296254 ive made a lot of friends all over the country all over the world
9296255 one of the magic things about the shelby ham fest is that many people meet for the first time face to face and a lot of times theyve been talking for years and years
9296256 its a family reunion of sorts and im really glad im here
9296257 the farthest ive talked with people is germany argentina or chile

9296275 la russie et les occidentaux ont tout perdre dune rupture
9296276 its perhaps unusual that shes not played more of a role in the campaign he really had only met her once or twice before
9296277 we picture mccain as more of a law enforcement candidate
9296278 mccain is the anti terrorist president mass transit are targets and we have to have the support of the federal government
9296279 i would expect to see less funding for anti terrorist efforts
9296280 were going to support mccains campaign on public safety day
9296281 im excited with the obama biden ticket i think its going to be a winning ticket and a chance to move forward in a time of change
9296282 was a union member and is married to a union member and understands the problems the hopes the values of working people
9296283 in our particular state labor is a cross section of society
9296284 if theyre union people and they understand anything about union issues they wouldnt be supporting mccain
9296285 john mccains commitment to expanding economic opportunity and putting his country first resonates strongly among working families
9296286 they know mccain is a reformer who delivers real results and that barack obama lacks the judgment and experience necessary to keep our economy strong and our country secure
9296287 obama doesnt take pac money so where the labor unions are likely to be important is get out the vote efforts
9296288 well do whatever the campaign needs we believe hes the future for us so were just going to educate our members
9296289 because massachusetts is not a battleground state we do more mailing and phone calling to our members here
9296290 this is a little more than what we had in mind in such a short time
9296291 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9296292 i looked at the standings and saw they were 10 games out so we didnt want to rub it in
9296293 everyone has said to me since that speech that he lived up to his reputation as the lion
9296294 everybody has told me how moved they were by his speech how glad they were he was able to be here in person and how they felt so strongly that him kicking off the convention was the right way to kick the convention off
9296295 styling garners enthusiastic responses and its never confused for anything but an suv
9296296 outlooks cabin is both functional and pleasing to the eye
9296297 a large crossover suv with seating for seven or eight passengers
9296298 garners enthusiastic responses and its never confused for anything but an suv
9296299 a growing number of crossover vehicles that actually look like crossover vehicles
9296300 the outlooks grille is dominated by a thick chrome bar that represents the new face of saturn offers
9296301 gauges are large clear and conveniently backlit even with headlights off
9296302 many of the buttons on the dashboard are a bit too small and similar looking making them hard to find and operate
9296303 outlook also trumps the competition in regards to maximum towing capacity
9296304 a 3 6 liter v6 rated at 270 hp and 248 pound feet of torque
9296305 the xr models dual rear exhaust boosts those numbers to 275 hp and 251 lb ft of torque
9296306 surprisingly strong for a large heavy vehicle with a v6 engine
9296307 expect the trip to 60 mph to take about eight seconds
9296308 properly equipped the outlook is capable of towing up to 4 500 pounds
9296309 the economy minded six speed automatic transmission can be sluggish with downshifts
9296310 2wd xe averaged 16 0 mpg in mostly city driving
9296311 awd xr averaged 17 5 mpg with more highway use
9296312 incredibly stiff chassis and good wheel control almost make up for any shortcomings
9296313 outlooks sheer size is a hindrance in close quarter maneuvering
9296314 among the largest midsize suvs outlooks cabin feels especially roomy
9296315 the first and second row seats should be comfortable for almost anyone
9296316 all three rows of seats offer near minivan levels of space
9296317 third row accommodations are far better than even some large suvs and theres adult size room for even mid distance trips
9296318 luggage capacity is 19 7 cubic feet with all seats up and a class leading 117 cubic feet with all rear seats down
9296319 includes a large glovebox multilevel console bin and roomy door pockets
9296320 smart slide second row seat that flips and slides in one motion to provide exceptionally easy access to the roomy third row
9296321 is along the lines of the new chevrolet silverado which is to say much better than past gm offerings but still not as refined as wed like
9296322 surfaces arent all soft to the touch but they are low gloss and look more expensive
9296323 the faux wood in xr models is convincing enough and the overall quality of interior materials is impressive
9296324 although there are some larger expanses of plastic up front the quality is such that it isnt a distraction
9296325 with the outlook at speed you can almost hear your fingers rubbing against the leather steering wheel rim
9296326 standard safety features include antilock brakes rollover sensing stability control
9296327 safety equipment includes front front side and three row side curtain airbags
9296328 fine outward visibility thanks to big mirrors and unobtrusive rear headrests
9296329 rear visibility is fair especially if the third rows head restraints are folded forward
9296330 pales in comparison to a rearview camera which some competitors offer
9296331 alluring options list includes a dvd based navigation system with rear backup camera
9296332 a cd mp3 sound system with an auxiliary audio jack
9296333 2008 saturn outlooks alluring options list includes a dvd based navigation system with rear backup camera dvd rear entertainment system

9296335 this will have such a huge impact on the telecoms environment
9296336 this is an undisputed victory not only for altech but for the whole telecoms industry and we are proud to have been pioneers in breaking competitive ground in what has been a long closed playing field
9296337 sudan was disappointing for us as the regulator required us to disconnect 1 1million subscribers who did not register their personal information we lost market share in sudan and im not sure if our competitors did the same disconnect subscribers its a high priority for us to resolve
9296338 there is a point in any process where the parties must either resolve their dispute or accept that they have obtained maximum gains there is also a time when common sense must prevail
9296339 in labour matters celerity and finality are valid objectives of the canadian labour dispute resolution system
9296340 but over time we realized the workout factor and great exercise benefits
9296341 theres nothing new about rebounding thats been around for 70 years weve taken it a step further by allowing people to move forward on trampolines rather than just up and down the exercise is a totally different world low impact but cardiovascular
9296342 its so much more fun than monotonous exercise people who might be able to jump 30 minutes cant last three minutes in here
9296343 you will within 10 minutes say uncle youll have had enough
9296344 you can either hop over it straddle it or step on it
9296345 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
9296346 it gives you back your teeth literally the teeth match perfectly line up and you dont have to take them out at night and clean them
9296347 when they actually put the screw into the bone theres a tapping and pounding
9296348 implants arent just the wave of the future theyre here and now
9296349 suggests harm in terms of increased numbers of benign lesions identified and an increased number of biopsies performed
9296350 our study shows that a self exam is probably a waste of time youre not going to get women sufficiently motivated to practice it well enough and frequently enough to make that big of a difference
9296351 talk to any busy breast cancer surgeon and theyll tell you 30 percent of the diagnoses are made by the patient not that they have cancer but they found their own lumps
9296352 just this morning i saw a 37 year old woman with a normal mammogram but she found a lump and was proactive about it and it turned out to be cancer
9296353 the world of early detection of breast cancer is imperfect
9296354 but this report robs women of one of the key tools in what is already a limited arsenal for detection it sends the wrong message to women about their role in their own health care
9296355 the midwifery model of care is based on empowering women to be the experts on their own bodies and health
9296356 i encourage women to check their own breasts once in a while so they can know whats normal for them and then they would be able to tell if something changes
9296357 some will tell me i cant tell the difference between what might be a benign fibroid cyst or a cancerous lump they just need to be familiar with their breasts
9296358 listen were not looking for a patient to diagnose herself were looking to teach them what their normal breast feels like so if they notice a change they can contact the appropriate caregiver for evaluation
9296359 and it really helps if youre running big sur and napa marathons this run essentially gives a great foundation for demanding road races
9296360 weve been lucky theres never been a problem between our runners and cars when we run out there
9296361 it can be on for four or five days and be helping you with the healing process
9296362 it also helps muscles to relax if theyre overused or facilitate them to work better if theyve been underused
9296363 for instance to help the muscle calm down and release the spasm youd put it on one way
9296364 to prevent an injury and increase range of motion you do it another way
9296365 i look at it like this if i can leave my hands on someone once they leave the clinic thats an ideal scenario this tape allows me sort of to do that
9296366 father joes blog is great fun to read too bad i will have to strike him dead with lightning some day
9296367 right after evening prayer i regularly read his blog and note corrections for my upcoming encyclicals
9296368 before i have my security council meeting each morning i check to see whats new at fr joes blog
9296369 this infidel priest is not funny and is ill informed
9296370 he is a right wing bigot who is anti choice and anti woman the goddess is not happy with his blog
9296371 he is the poorest priest i know always pontificating about things he knows nothing about he is a disgrace
9296372 the invasion is going as planned and soon all the clergy will be pod people from outer space starting with father joe
9296373 never have i met someone who was so opposed to true ecumenism and religious freedom i would like to sacrifice him in my dinner pot and wear his head as an ornament voices like his need to be silenced we should all pray and sup together
9296374 peter please im an x man i dont shoot people im just trying to make a point
9296375 we are catching an early glimpse of the only candidate in recent memory who can pose a challenge to jackie os legendary style
9296376 i am incredibly honored that michelle obama chose to wear a dress from my collection on such a historical night for her her family and this country
9296377 im the doctor im a time lord im 903 years old and im the man whos going to save your lives and all six billion people on the planet below you got a problem with that
9296378 the nepali proletariat will not be tolerant of such regional misconduct this is an act against foremost force in south asia that is totally committed to peace and posterity eh i mean prosperity
9296379 we are going to teach them a lesson we isolate this bharat who does he think he is this sardar towelhead next i am going to grab him by his kaccha
9296380 nationalism and the state are new phenomena given the importance they play in international relations today one of the most difficult theoretical and applied problems of the post cold war era has been the search for an adequate understanding of the resurgence of religion ethnicity and stateless nationalism in international relations more exclusively social scientists and policymakers have been challenged to clarify the nature and impacts of religion ethnicity and stateless nationalism in both sub state and inter state conflicts in the international system
9296381 while psychologists and historians still debate exactly how this took place there is little doubt that the intense emotions felt by leaders and followers alike contributed to the atrocities committed by people from all three of these countries
9296382 unfinished work of marx in this regard took some momentum by lenins foreign policy but it was not adequate for 21st century to stay statelessness and just live for and with ideology
9296383 na elke gang moesten brusselmans decleir mijnen nonkel ik en al die ander sukkels die een safke wouden opsteken iedere keer weer helemaal door die buizen weer naar beneden daar stonden we dan met zijn allen te smoren tot het weer tijd werd om naar boven te gaan voor de volgende gang

9296385 we hope that with this price tag and the quality of service we will be able to garner at least 5 000 subscriber in the first three months lower monthly commitment would be a strong and bold step by world phone for enhancing broadband penetration in masses
9296386 we will be commencing the operations by the end of december starting from north and eastern parts of the country and then south and west by march 2009 so that within six months we will be able to roll out the 3g operations
9296387 mostly we will try to cover the state capitals in the first phase and then taking it to major cities and other towns
9296388 el principio de concurrencia de jurisdicciones no puede ser excusa para continuar con la impunidad en la comisi n de cr menes internacionales

9296400 peter please im an x man i dont shoot people im just trying to make a point
9296401 never underestimate john mccain because just when you think youve got him figured out youre wrong
9296402 its been a really long primary a really long road
9296403 i was secretly hoping she would be the pick and not someone just kind of boring shes got a record of reform and that is exactly what our party needs to be about
9296404 youve got a competent governor youve got a working mother it reinforces the image of mccain that was prevalent before the democrats tried to paint him as more of bush
9296405 having a native son running for president with a real possibility of winning i think arizona has got to take a lot of pride in that
9296406 the visuals of this convention are going to be striking
9296407 youll see a set backdrop that is probably more carefully designed for visual impact than youve ever seen before
9296408 everybody in our convention hall is going to be enthusiastic for john mccain
9296409 that wasnt the case in denver its clear theres a sizable contingent of hillary clinton supporters who are going along but theyre not happy about it
9296410 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
9296411 too bad you have to ride the bus for a week
9296412 i think they bit off more than they could chew
9296413 hopefully there will be some funds available when we get the claims submitted
9296414 there werent enough hours in the day to keep up with the work
9296415 of course we would just like to have the money back that we put down
9296416 i dont know what the plan is at this second
9296417 no investor group stepped forward and sought to raise any criminal complaints
9296418 she has taken a crockpot of soup on the bus
9296419 i will think twice about buying two for one ice cream

9296421 weve really been able to spend a great deal of time together
9296422 its good exercise for me im inclined to not exercise
9296423 there are streets in this town you should never ride on
9296424 you dont need a fancy bike you dont need fancy shoes and fancy pedals the point is to reduce how often you use your car you kind of get the best of both worlds

9296664 let me tell you the reason i picked joe biden
9296665 number three is somebody who i know in his heart cares about the american people and the american dream and is willing to fight for them as hard as he can and joe biden fit that bill
9296666 what do you think of senator mccains vice presidential choice and how does it change the dynamics of this campaign
9296667 well i dont know governor palin i have not met her before i had a brief conversation with her after she was selected to congratulate her and wish her luck but not too much luck on the campaign trial and she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and a up and coming public servant
9296668 so its too early for me to gauge what kind of running mate shell be
9296669 my sense is that she subscribes to john mccains agenda and ultimately this election is going to be about where i want to take the country and where joe biden wants to take the country and where john mccain and his running mate want to take the country
9296670 notre gouvernement est heureux dappuyer les c l brations du centenaire de bruderheim a d clar la ministre verner nous sommes fiers de nous associer aux communaut s comme celle de bruderheim et dautres pour soutenir des activit s qui c l brent lhistoire les arts et le patrimoine locaux
9296671 les festivals locaux comme celui ci rassemblent des gens de tous ges et leur permettent de revivre leur histoire a ajout m benoit je suis fier que notre gouvernement appuie des activit s qui nous aident avoir davantage conscience de la valeur de notre patrimoine collectif
9296672 nous sommes tr s heureux de recevoir cet appui qui nous aidera organiser les c l brations du centenaire de bruderheim a mentionn m fred hawryluk pr sident du bruderheim lions club et pr sident du comit du centenaire de bruderheim ce financement nous permettra de mettre en valeur lhistoire de la municipalit de bruderheim au profit de ses citoyens actuels et de ceux qui y reviendront pour loccasion
9296673 our government is pleased to support the bruderheim centennial celebration
9296674 we are proud to partner with communities like bruderheim and others to support activities that celebrate local history arts and heritage
9296675 local festivals like this one bring people of all ages together and allow them to experience their history
9296676 i am proud that our government is supporting activities that strengthen our shared sense of heritage
9296677 we are very pleased to receive this support towards the celebration of bruderheims centennial
9296678 the funding allows us to help showcase the history of the town of bruderheim for the current citizens and the ones returning to bruderheim from past eras
9296679 imaging practices focused on cardiac ct have very particular needs when it comes to interpretation software
9296680 studies are several times larger than typical radiology examinations and multiple users require concurrent access to the full diagnostic tool set but via an affordable and flexible licensing model in addition distribution of interactive 3d results to referring physicians is a powerful aid to demonstrating the value and convenience of ct technology as a complement to existing diagnostic paradigms in cardiology
9296681 it is now possible to purchase a server for two cardiac users at a price point competitive with the single workstation usually included in a ct scanner purchase
9296682 access for additional users can then be purchased as required without a need for re training or a change in deployment strategy the system is capable of opening studies comprised of over 6000 slices to accommodate the most demanding clinical needs and includes all available clinical functionality without compromises representing an unmatched value in the marketplace today in todays cardiac ct environment there is virtually no case where a single workstation with a ct or mr scanner is adequate to meet the clinical need and by combining multiple users with the flexibility of true client server architecture we are confident this product will be very popular as an alternative to the advanced visualization offerings normally bundled with imaging modalities
9296683 with the aquarius intuition server terarecon offers the highest single server capacity available on the market today for the largest number of concurrent users accessing the largest ct examinations with all cardiac tools available
9296684 this is a direct and important benefit afforded by terarecons unique technology platform which despite many attempts no gpu or cpu based solution has been able to match

9296694 the fact that john mccain does not know how many houses he owns when millions are struggling to stay in the only house they have shows hes out of touch with the lives of real americans
9296695 it was a mistake to have been engaged with him at all in this or any other personal business dealing that would allow him or anyone else to believe he had done me a favor
9296696 it surprised me that late in the game he obama continued to take contributions from somebody who was under a rather dark cloud in the state

9296701 well the teeth are fine but these gums have to go
9296702 what if this is a complete and utter waste of time
9296703 this deviation could have significant impact on the future track and forecasts and expected landfall scenarios
9296704 for the u s the shift could be a signal showing an increased threat that new orleans could be in the path of a direct hit we also see eastern cuba under the gun for potentially catastrophic damage from storm surge and high winds additionally there is a higher threat for stronger winds and gusts beginning late today and into sunday for the florida keys
9296705 our peaceful prosperous and pluralistic society welcomes people of all faiths
9296706 this major danger is going to hit us with all its worth its not a possibility its is a fact
9296707 gustav is the same strength a hurricane as katrina there will be economic losses for sure
9296708 the western part of cuba is going to be most affected but also havana which has two million people may suffer a lot
9296709 it courageously raised the retirement age by two years and began to fix germanys ballooning budget deficit
9296710 the bottom line from this study is that australians think now is the time to adopt a climate change program that has some real teeth
9296711 china did not build the magnificent 43 billion infrastructure for these games or put on the unparalleled opening and closing ceremonies simply by the dumb luck of discovering oil

9296715 i cant begin this great effort without honouring the achievement of geraldine ferraro in 1984 and of course hillary clinton who showed determination in her presidential campaign
9296716 the government has written to all 20 internet service providers and i expect that we will be shut down within just a few days
9296717 the idea was to raise awareness among families especially because this is the first layer of barrier and to help people to realize they are not alone and be able to face the problem
9296718 a vote for mccain palin is a vote for gay marriage
9296719 sought to block the state from giving public employee benefits such as health insurance to same sex couples
9296720 sarah palins veto gave gays the same rights as married couples in alaska
9296721 a vote for mccain palin is a vote for gay marriage
9296722 a significant part of palins base of support lies among social and christian conservatives her positions on social issues emerged slowly during the campaign on abortion should be banned for anything other than saving the life of the mother stem cell research opposed physician assisted suicide opposed creationism should be discussed in schools state health benefits for same sex partners opposed and supports a constitutional amendment to bar them
9296723 she is against gay marriage although she did support equal access to benefits for same sex couples in alaska
9296724 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9296725 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9296726 it seems almost like a hail mary pass at the end of a football game
9296727 eminent domain are two words in a 16 page document with improvements to sewage systems brown fields and recreation areas but no one is even focusing on those
9296728 eminent domain would be a last resort to make sure the plan gets done and that the city grows
9296729 the 4th district needs to have a choice to have somebody represent them who will put property rights in the forefront

9296734 the chemicals management plan is an important part of our governments commitment to protect the health and environment of canadians by assessing and managing the risks posed by certain substances
9296735 canadians can expect this government to continue to deliver results
9296736 canadians want to know how these types of chemicals affect them and their families
9296737 thats why our government is leading the way in the world today in making informed decisions about how these substances can best be managed for the safety of canadians and our environment

9296743 no woman should ever have to choose between having a child and a career abortion is a reflection that society has failed women women deserve better choices practical alternatives and resources
9296744 she can choose single parenthood and use food stamps or temporary assistance to needy families
9296745 she can choose single parenthood and use food stamps or temporary assistance to needy families she can choose adoption or college age women can pressure school campuses to offer child care and family housing so that they never ever have to choose between a pregnancy and an education
9296746 her state government ranks number 1 in spending per capita
9296747 the state has taken into its hands a good bit of the means of production owning 28 billion in assets as well as 36 billion in a permanent fund
9296748 they return this hoard to the people in the form of annual checks
9296749 she s the mayor of i think the second largest city in alaska before she ran for governor
9296750 gov palin took on ted stevens if she can take him on she can take on the russians
9296751 its not that sarah palin is inexperienced its that this is gross political misconduct
9296752 the possibility that obama might win alaska did not worry palin
9296753 the bloom is definitely falling off the rose in alaska and the palin honeymoon may be finally wearing off
9296754 this is like hiring a carpenter who is good with a saw to be the person to operate on your tumor
9296755 finally an honest politician alaska can be proud of rises to national level i will give her all my support alaskans must unite to help governor palin with everything she needs in the coming months i for one am ready to man the phones process mail babysit clean her house anything she needs
9296756 there s no better person to identify with alaskans and every day americans
9296757 some of the things she did was to put the state s airplane up for sale on ebay governor youre no dan quayle
9296758 mccains selection of palin ended a long and gut wrenching selection process driven by the senators desire to do something unconventional
9296759 will john mccain choose gov sarah palin as his vp
9296760 alaska governor sarah palin is the youngest to take that office suggested as a vp for mccain
9296761 draft palin for vp campaign began in march palins fashion and some country fur alaska magazine february 2008 when a reporter and photographers from vogue magazine came to alaska in december to do a story on her palin was sure she disappointed them in the interview you could tell that the writer was trying to get me to focus on the gender and appearance issues but i kept talking about energy and national security and not relying on foreign sources of energy palin said finally she stopped me and said i know that s what you want to talk about but this is a women s fashion magazine i don t know about fashion it s bunny boots and fleece and the north face so i tried to talk about that but it s just not the way i m wired
9296762 she comes from the same kind of stock as most north idaho folks do she would have made a dandy politician in north idaho because of her values which im sure she got from her father
9296763 chuck heath sarahs father spent his youth hunting fishing and playing sports before starting his career as a middle school science teacher said childhood friend and former idaho state sen kermit kiebert
9296764 sarah is an unorthodox political original ill give her that try any crap with her shell find a way to knock them back on their asses ive been knocked on my ass a few times by her and i can vouch for that
9296765 i believe in protecting alaskas environment through fair enforcement of our environmental laws

9296797 zentrale herausforderung des projektes ist es lokale kollektiv produzierte contents und damit die vielschichtigkeit lokaler kulturen in europa auf neue innovative netzplattformen zu bringen die benutzer in den communities sollen zu diesen inhalten nomadisch und von zu hause aus mit unterschiedlichsten endger ten von der settop box ber den pc und den pda bis hin zu mobilen devices zugang haben und ber verschiedenste medien miteinander in dialog treten k nnen
9296798 bei diesem spannenden eu forschungsprojekt von 15 namhaften partnern aus industrie und wissenschaft und 3 konkreten testbeds geht es vielmehr um die st rkere einbindung einzelner user generated content akteure in die technologische plattformentwicklung und letztlich den zusammenschluss dieser semi professionellen a v produzenten zu virtuellen produktionsgemeinschaften die sich kollektiv definierten anliegen ihrer community widmen

9296803 obviously we were sorting through the roster cuts this morning and the timing wasnt very good thats for sure we had difficult decisions there and it came down to we had a couple of guys there we know we had here last year and we made the decision to keep them
9296804 on the offensive line we just had very good competition we felt that was one of the deepest spots on our roster unfortunately we were unable to keep all the guys they competed well and it just happened that we could only keep nine
9296805 but it became more and more evident each week that was a decision that made sense

9296873 i got a chance to throw my two coins into this fountain one coin for a wish and one coin to some day return to rome
9296874 i believe what will help me the most in my career was not what i learned in a book in class or what the teachers taught us but what i learned by working with peers from all over the world we had a lot of teamwork and i had to work with many different individuals with different beliefs backgrounds and work ethic
9296875 it was very trying at times to work under these conditions but it is amazing to be given an assignment and be able to complete it with your teammates
9296876 it was during those weeks when time allowed that i took full advantage of the opportunity to travel
9296877 the language barrier was definitely an issue especially in the beginning i had never studied french before only spanish so this proved to be quite difficult

9296880 i dont know how you can fake vomiting all over yourself night after night after night im not that good an actor he said
9296881 you know ive never been to the philippines and im just as excited its a first for me and im glad to hear that filipinos are just as excited too
9296882 oh i have filipino acquaintances here in switzerland in the uk and in france i heard that the philippines is a beautiful country and that the filipinos really love music
9296883 oh i dont know i dont know how im supposed to feel about it you know i started singing when i was a child at the age of about eight its not like i became a star when i was 18
9296884 i suppose to i enjoyed singing when i was a child and i enjoy it now just as much now actually you know i did have some problems during my adolescence but i guess that every adolescent has problems my problems were perhaps more difficult because i was growing up in public but apart from that no problem i love singing and its a great joy to be able to do something that you like so much
9296885 lets put it this way i had a different childhood i didnt have a normal childhood i dont know what a normal childhood is childhood is a magic time and it happens very fast other children might have been going through the different stages of childhood and i must have been going through the same experience but only on a different level
9296886 i really dont know but it seems that my voice hasnt really changed since i was a child it sounds the same to me and i hope to other people i dont think my voice has changed much at all i still sing the same songs like downtown and dont sleep in the subway in the same key as when i recorded them
9296887 not really my mother was welsh i dont know much about the welsh people but i guess they are very very musical they love to sing like the italians tom jones is welsh and so is shirley bassey among the actors anthony hopkins is welsh you know music is in our veins but i didnt really come from a musical family at all
9296888 yes i do it was a song called mighty like a rose and in fact i first sang it when i was six years old at age eight i was already famous and i continued singing that song
9296889 you know i worked so hard on my career i married a frenchman and we moved to france and i became frances no 1 singer that was before 1964 when downtown was recorded the 60s were a special time for me the beatles made it much easier for british singers to be played on the radio downtown became a hit in america and i did a lot of hits after that
9296890 you know i have my downtimes as well like everybody else and in times like that i take my mind away from it and get out and see the rest of the world
9296891 i have many many fond memories you know they were wonderful years they were also complicated years because you know i was married and i had two children then we have now three children i was traveling all over the place and i was trying to be a good mother and a good performer luckily i was working with amazing people
9296892 i think you know the answer to that hmmmm you know there are good and there are bad there were good singers and bad singers then and there are good singers and bad singers now the world has changed a lot and so has the music industry and the people people dont seem to buy records as much as people back then did thats one thing i dont like about it
9296893 ahhh i was never allowed to go on the frontline there was another little girl who was also singing at that time her name is julie andrews
9296894 julie is a very very very nice lady we used to perform for the troops but in different camps
9296895 hmmm we were not exactly rivals we both just like to sing
9296896 i enjoy acting as much as i enjoy singing as a little girl i also wanted to be an actress i didnt think of myself as being a singer singing and acting are very closely related when im doing a show its wonderful because i have to act and feel what i am singing to me thats perfection when i do a concert as i am doing in manila every show is like a play in my mind so i use acting when i sing and vice versa
9296897 my family has been away in turkey and i was left home with the dogs to be honest with you i dont really live here i go to many different places geneva is a nice place to come back to when youre away for long its a very relaxing place
9296898 i write music i play the piano by the way can you tell me does everybody speak very good english in the philippines
9296899 oh thats good because during a concert i also love to talk its not just about singing its about talking to the audience im really looking forward to performing in the philippines
9296900 thats about it i did a uk tour at the beginning of summer ive been writing writing writing i also spend time in the french alps where we have a house after manila ill be in vancouver then new york and then rome
9296901 well we are a very unusual family were not always together i have a daughter who lives in new york she has two beautiful children i have another daughter who lives in paris shes not married last night i had dinner with my son who got married three weeks ago he lives in geneva we are living in different places all right but we try to see each other as often as we can we are probably a much closer family than most people i know
9296902 yes i did i wish i could do the same thing to my grandchildren they think im a pretty cool grandmother because i usually ride around in limousines and they see me singing in fine hotels im not the usual grandmother
9296903 ahhh thats difficult let me think tony bennett is best remembered for i left my heart in san francisco yes i want to be remembered for downtown
9296904 if the merchants are for it let it happen but be very very careful about electric signage

9296910 todd said get your stuff and get to oakland as fast as you can

9296912 then he put his hand on my head and i felt myself falling backwards theyre all praying that the demon of homosexuality will leave me im crying on the floor having this religious experience and being told god loves me

9296920 rise to the challenge of campaigning in his own backyard
9296921 it doesnt help things when the chancellor starts saying that the economy is down the tubes especially when the prime minister just so happens to have been looking after it for the last 10 years
9296922 i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9296923 this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9296924 in 10 months weve gone from doing ok to certainly not doing ok people are pissed off
9296925 scotlands economy is showing real resilience in what are challenging times and mr darlings ridiculous interview is in danger of dragging everyone down to the labour partys own level
9296926 going to church doesnt make you a christian any gt more than going to a garage makes you a mechanic
9296927 the saorstat na heireann act recieved the royal assent on 6th december
9296928 what your poll doesnt show is that many people there consider themselves to be both irish and british
9296929 this is new guidance for ministerial offices in responding to correspondence on reserved issues clearly on a number of subjects reserved to westminster including international affairs and trident nuclear weapons the scottish government has a different position from the uk administration and one more in tune with the majority of people in scotland
9296930 alex salmond fundamentally has no respect for devolution the devolution divide has been backed by the people of scotland who have voted for it that means that the people of scotland want westminster to do some things and the scottish government to do other things we respect that but he has contempt for it
9296931 i dont know on what basis they can produce a scottish government view on these areas
9296932 the permafrost now has small holes we have found elevated levels of methane above the water surface and even more in the water just below it is obvious that the source is the seabed
9296933 to accept the fact that after fertilization has taken place a new human has come into being is no longer a matter of taste or of opinion the human nature of the human being from conception to old age is not a metaphysical contention it is plain experimental evidence

9296935 arizona is changing it used to be a more reliably republican state but as people have come in from other states they have taken their politics with them mccain has the same problem with republicans in arizona as he has with republicans in the rest of the country
9296936 he is conservative enough on social and foreign policy and some economic policy to appeal to those elements while also deploying the occasional liberal view which appeals to independents and undecideds
9296937 if you cross him he doesnt forget hes like an elephant
9296938 but he is just as famous for his showy acts of conciliation luxurious gift baskets saying im sorry i blew up at you
9296939 a large part of him and his appeal is that he feels he can talk himself out of anything and he is notoriously fearless when challenged
9296940 at least i dont plaster on the make up like a trollop you c
9296941 i think he is mentally unstable and not fit to be president
9296942 when are we going to send an airmail message to tehran
9296943 listen pal i spent 22 years in the navy my father was in the navy my grandfather was in the navy we in the military service tend to move a lot we have to live in all parts of the country all parts of the world i wish i could have had the luxury like you of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of arizona but i was doing other things as a matter of fact when i think about it now the place i lived longest in my life was hanoi
9296944 for a politician mccain sure talks a lot of sense i admire him he has life experience and he speaks out for what he believes in
9296945 i wouldnt vote for obama no way hes a muslim
9296946 we were told by winehouses agent at 8pm that she would not be there and we were forced to cancel the performance
9296947 we have still not been given any explanation of the exact reasons for her absence
9296948 the suggestions about binding lists of values or whole statements are non starters
9296949 we have got a specially adapted treadmill that is linked in to a virtual reality system so a little bit like a computer game
9296950 the particularly interesting aspect in terms of the research we are doing here is that we have found that it we manipulate the virtual reality so that people think they are moving slower than they are what happens is that they move faster and better
9296951 they do not realise they are putting any more effort in and they are not feeling any more pain in fact they are less anxious than normal
9296952 they have a better quality of walking so it has huge implications for recovery
9296953 the virtual system encourages patients to walk more quickly and for longer almost without them realising it
9296954 when like andy people walk with a stick they automatically lean to one side
9296955 this treadmill keeps them upright and enables them to adjust their balance better
9296956 because it is a virtual reality andy can see things on the screen as he is walking along so he is not conscious how slow or fast he is going as his mind is occupied
9296957 on a normal treadmill you have nowhere to look but your feet and that is where people lose their balance
9296958 if he can get to use it on a regular basis he will make great strides
9296959 if this was available maybe three or four years ago he might not be walking with a stick now
9296960 it is just such a fantastic system for helping with rehabilitation
9296961 say what you will tis better to be left than never too have been loved
9296962 im for barack obama all the way the clinton campaign has took a desperate turn and has i think shown its true colors how dare they use fear against americans after these past seven years im really tired of politicians telling me what to be afraid of on the other hand obama is hopeful grounded and clearly intelligent he is relatively an outsider to the beholden d c club and i think that is what america is calling out for not a career politician but a true outsider candidate he represents i think the true spirit of the beginning of the 21st century
9296963 engage and build the political power of young people in order to achieve progressive change in our country
9296964 every time i watch film i realize another guy stands out
9296965 they do a good job and we are going to have to be on our a game
9296966 i am not afraid but i am concerned about chaos in the nation
9296967 we cannot let the seizure of government house continue indefinitely without taking action
9296968 i came to this job under a legal mandate i will only go if the law does not allow me to stay and not simply because someone issues threats and puts pressure on me
9296969 is this the only way we can reach pupils today
9296970 zanu pf dismissed that not just as insolent but also because it demonstrated stunning ignorance on how government works
9296971 to accept the fact that after fertilization has taken place a new human has come into being is no longer a matter of taste or of opinion the human nature of the human being from conception to old age is not a metaphysical contention it is plain experimental evidence

9296979 t advertisement he people didnt want to join and we didnt have enough money
9296980 if the us administration sees that its war against the muslims is legitimate then what makes us believe that our war on its territories is not legitimate
9296981 everyone must know that we will not hesitate in targeting it whenever we can and wherever it is on this planet
9296982 a group that had limited its terrorist activities to algeria is now part of the global jihad movement
9296983 these groups as best we can tell have a fair amount of independence they get inspiration they get sometimes guidance probably some training probably some money from the al qaeda leadership
9296984 its not as centralised a movement as it was say in 2001 but in some ways the fact that it has spread in the way that it has in my view makes it perhaps more dangerous
9296985 the brothers implementing the process are connected with us and we have previously trained some of them and we offer them adequate support for the implementation of such operations
9296986 successfully employed by insurgents and terrorists in iraq and afghanistan
9296987 terrorism has been vanquished despite the sporadic manifestation we are facing up to in the most energetic manner

9297022 i think were going to have to examine our tag line dangerously inexperienced
9297023 and i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9297024 weve got our work cut out this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation
9297025 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment people are pissed off with us

9297092 are we seeing the final act of the brown drama
9297093 the economys not so bad and britain is well placed
9297094 well thats it hes just pulled the pin on this govt
9297095 we have unlocked the talents of hardworking families in a competitive global marketplace of opportunity and empowerment
9297096 are we seeing the final act of the brown drama
9297097 he has probably seen the polls that suggest he could lose edinburgh sw to either the tories or the snp
9297098 all this is set against the background of terrible opinion poll ratings for the party and the by election in the seat next door to gordons that will have to take place in the autumn
9297099 browns aides point out that browns seat and the glenrothes seat are
9297100 if you had to choose which would you prefer to see after the next election a conservative government led by david cameron or a labour government led by gordon brown
9297101 sam galbraith the former education minister said kerr was a
9297102 its like all these people who brief off the record they think nobody knows its them but of course everybody knows because your friends in the press tell you
9297103 andy kerr said only a strong leader of a vibrant labour party in scotland stands between alex salmond and his goal of independence if this is so the current plight of scottish labour will give much heart to those who are not averse to following the snp down the road to greater and greater self determination you will probably want to know which candidate is best suited for leadership the answer is none of the above
9297104 oi voters stfu i know what im doing right right
9297105 brown will only fall if his cabinet deserts him here is the first public crack
9297106 privately labour mps were even more outspoken one mp who is close to the prime minister said alistair has got to go and his job must be given to ed balls ed is the cleverest person in the cabinet and has the full confidence of the prime minister
9297107 i think its important that government ministers ppss and me in particular are level with people and explain that every other country in the world ours included have a credit crunch the like of which we have not seen in generations at the same time as oil and food prices going up
9297108 has the prime minister actually got the power to put in place
9297109 hes betting his presidency on a naked political play for holdout hillary supporters and other female swing voters and hoping that a large share of these predominantly pro choice women will ignore or overlook palins staunch pro life anti stem cell views
9297110 you think she has a lck of experience so does bo
9297111 i know hillary clinton hillary clinton is a friend of mine and you are no hillary clinton
9297112 fuse the two pillars of the reagan revolution traditional conservatives and libertarian republicans
9297113 on the potential downside the drama was evidently entirely genuine the fact that mccain only spoke with palin about the vice presidency for the first time on sunday and that he was seriously considering lieberman until days ago suggests just how hectic and improvisational his process was
9297114 you are fairly rude in the guardian about a couple of colleagues you think wendy alexander is unlikeable
9297115 i have got the utmost admiration for wendy and the problems she went through
9297116 no i have the utmost respect for her and i thoroughly enjoy her encounters whenever we have them
9297117 brian i have the utmost regard for wendy and i will continue to have it and that remains my position
9297118 i dont know why he tried to duck the question
9297119 in a gubernatorial debate palin stated emphatically that her opposition to abortion was so great so total that even if her teenage daughter was impregnated by a rapist she would
9297120 governor if kitty dukakis were raped and murdered would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer
9297121 the fact that apparently the two had only met each other on a couple of occasions
9297122 i am glad you seem to think i am a spokesman for a gop vp especially as i have never been to the us
9297123 one recent job interview i went to i got top marks on my technical knowledge they said i was not down to earth enough you have got to be kidding a bloke who goes shoppingat asda loves going to mcdonalds and burger king talking to strangers on trains boozing in wetherspoons etc not down to earth enough mad completly barking mad
9297124 this person will be impossible to mould into our organisation because they are too set in their ways and dont accept the fact that every employee still has something to learn
9297125 i think i would be so angry and bereaved that i would want the death penalty for him but i dont think the justice system should be based on how id feel at that moment
9297126 how can anyone consider anything that goes on on this site negative or otherwise
9297127 this desire to be principled losers is part of whats wrong with the left
9297128 these numbers pretty much speak for themselves but men have a favorable impression of palin by a 35 point margin whereas women have a favorable impression of her by an 18 point margin conversely by a 23 point margin women do not think palin is ready to be president whereas palin lost this question among men by a considerably smaller 6 point magrin why does this gap exist dont know but it may simply be a matter of ideology men are generally a bit more conservative than women and opinions of palin are very strongly determined by ideology conservatives have a favorable impression of her by a 79 8 margin but this falls to 43 35 among moderates and 26 46 among liberals likewise by a 48 22 margin conservatives think shes ready to be president but she loses this question 23 54 among moderates and 9 67 among liberals
9297129 nationwide four percent 4 have a very favorable opinion of palin while seven percent 7 have a very unfavorable view twenty one percent 21 hold less firm opinions of her and are evenly divided
9297130 sarah palin will wow cultural conservatives in areas where they may not have come out to vote before the selection this is right out of karl roves strategy of getting more of your own to show up and vote however in many of the swing states that bush carried in 2004 there were anti gay ballot measures to motivate the cultural conservatives to vote there are very few of these measures on the ballots in those key states in 2008 palin may not be enough for them to get out and vote clearly rove felt in 2004 that bush would not have been enough thus the ballot measures in fact as palins cultural views become better known she oppose abortion in all cases and opposes the use of birth control pi11s and condoms even among married couples she will undoubtedly scare the hell out of the soccer moms and 98 of hillary voters in fact many of these women may feel insulted by this choice in that mccain and the gop think they are stupid and would bypass their own interest reproductive and economic to vote for the ticket due to gender and anger that hillary was not the nominee in my estimation as a pollster and analyst while historic for the gop in selecting their first woman on a national ticket this choice may be the worst selection by a major party nominee for president in modern times
9297131 sarah palin may be one of the smartest tactical moves made by the mccain campaign and the democrats should be very careful in their line of attack against her depending on how she is defined at the republican convention she could be a game changer
9297132 state senate president lyda green said she thought it was a joke when someone called her at 6 a m to give her the news
9297133 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9297134 im intrigued by the many conservatives on this and other threads citing executive experience as essential for national leadership
9297135 my problem is i am seen as over educated by many employers too well spoken too polite
9297136 if i was that insignificant stupid and useless why comment on me
9297137 things bad you say badger yeah really you vacuous toad
9297138 as for clarke its time he was put out to grass
9297139 i know which of the two brown or cameron i think has the better judgement
9297140 david e johnson ceo of strategic vision llc accurately predicted the presidential nomination of arizona senator john mccain in 2007 on potus radio when all political experts had written mccains obituary
9297141 do yer wana be in my gang my gang my gang do yer wana be in my gang oh yehhhh
9297142 im not sure the pharmaceutical industry has yet figured out a way to offer self awareness in pill form
9297143 the twenty years of church going that slipped obamas mind
9297144 no more boom and bust no more boom and bust
9297145 hello hello im back again its good to be back
9297146 as among the worst abusers of human rights in africa
9297147 i think you are allowing yourself to indulge in a little wishful thinking
9297148 for the avoidance of doubt this market will be settled on the result of the next us presidential election
9297149 i can not see the electoral college voting for palin for president in such circumstances in sufficient numbers in order for her to win
9297150 the government was plunged into turmoil yesterday as the chancellor admitted the full scale of britains economic crisis
9297151 it emerged that last week yvette cooper darlings deputy had circulated a memo on the economy to labour spin doctors striking a markedly different tone from her boss
9297152 make no mistake about it this woman is a threat she may be panned by the pundits for her stunning lack of experience and for being a lightweight on national and foreign policy but gov palin poses a real threat this election
9297153 when i interviewed mr brown in beijing last week he behaved in a way i can describe only as unusual
9297154 he grimaced at the mere mention of david milibands name and declined to answer
9297155 a treasury insider said this plan is financial insanity and would seriously threaten the countrys long term future it is so complicated basically all smoke and mirrors that almost no one really understands it but mr brown is adamant this is what he wants he thinks its the big bang the government needs to relaunch mr darling and the treasury loathe it plans are changing almost by the hour
9297156 i know were not supposed to hold grudges and i dont think the governor does but those of us around her certainly remember that you know
9297157 and theres a gentleman by the name of mike wooten whos a trooper in the valley
9297158 it would be ugly i dont think anybody wants that but you know todd and sarah are scratching their heads why on earth hasnt this why is this guy still representing the department hes a horrible recruiting tool you know from their perspective everybodys protecting him palin chief of staff mike tibbles disagrees with me trooper chief audie holloway probably disagrees with me walt monegan does and everything and i understand its really touchy but i want you to understand
9297159 its very important to us that the governor have a good opinion and impression of the department i mean we care very deeply about what she thinks about the department and i dont want it to appear that we dont
9297160 well please tell her that i certainly am concerned and ill immediately get on the phone after were done and see if theres something that the department does not know about this something more that can be done maybe some additional information that you dont have that i can pass on
9297161 women travelling over state boundaries to have abortions then being prosecuted on return etc
9297162 with no decision of the supreme court individual court of appeals could decide which would mean you would basically revert to the pre rode vs wade situation where in liberal states abortion was permitted and in conservative states abortion was illegal
9297163 what ever your mind can conceive it can also achieve
9297164 when will i find the time to do all of this visualization stuff
9297165 my life is busy i dont have enough hours in the day already
9297166 the only free time i have is when im exhausted at the end of my
9297167 sketching out what it would take to pilot a vertical farm
9297168 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9297169 and it is warm not something im really used to
9297170 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9297171 can be a distraction in these kinds of situations so we want to make sure that were monitoring the situation and that were being useful
9297172 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me
9297173 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9297174 can step in and become president and i dont think anybody has any doubt about that
9297175 counsel and advice of somebody whos not going to agree with me 100 percent of the time
9297176 but for the rest of us theres still no change
9297177 we plan to start when were going to start and end when were going to end
9297178 right now it appears to have restored a leaner version
9297179 im not sure when well have it back up the way it was
9297180 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9297181 and it is warm not something im really used to
9297182 it wasnt last time and hopefully weve learned from that tragedy
9297183 after 19 months of traversing through every state except alaska
9297184 which now that i think about it were going to have to go there now
9297185 i will end this responsibly and finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan
9297186 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9297187 the mouse works fine in the desktop environment but for home entertainment or working on a notebook its over
9297188 yalls heart yalls spirit yall mean a whole lot to me
9297189 to play the first game of the season and have the place fill up and have the crowd loud and behind you is something special i dont think theres been a first game here at kansas in a while that sold out
9297190 we got a win which is the most important thing but i think we have room for improvement
9297191 in the first game you find out a little bit about your team whos in the right spots and where we have to tweak things so this will be a good tape for us to study tomorrow
9297192 i just threw it out there in the back of the end zone i couldnt really see where he was headed
9297193 i kind of threw it to a spot and he went up and made an amazing catch thats the kind of things he can do for us
9297194 as we get better it seems like everything around us gets better those are all signs of progress
9297195 they were one of the best teams in the country last year and i think they will be this year too when you get out here and the speed is turned up about two or three notches its not as quite as slow of a game as it was on the practice field
9297196 that means were efficient that means were doing our job
9297197 that means were playing hard and locking and locking and were fighting trying to win
9297198 we wanted to come out start fast and get the connection going
9297199 we were productive and thats all that matters in the first game
9297200 he probably could have played but there was no sense in him playing
9297201 were going to have to do a better job next week
9297202 i dont think any doubt came into my mind we never thought that we were going to lose the game
9297203 what came into my mind was weve got to do something to get going we were a little stagnant we came out a little bit flat in the third quarter
9297204 we just cant afford that many fumbles especially in one quarter
9297205 i dont think we panicked at all we came out in the fourth quarter and put a couple more scores on the board
9297206 i really dont consider it much success other than the long ones
9297207 i did get hit out of bounds a couple of times
9297208 i compete really hard so when i get hit out of bounds i dont really know whats going on i just want to get back on the field i guess vince was right there he was probably talking trash
9297209 colt played as good of a game as ive seen tonight
9297210 theres a lesson to be learned any time you talk before a game you learn to keep your mouth shut
9297211 i know one thing theyre a lot tougher than we are
9297212 i dont know if my remarks helped their team if they did then i apologize to my team
9297213 i thought the whole defense played well after the young secondary got settled down at halftime
9297214 as i tried to say way back and no one would believe me if you put nine people in the box were going to throw the football its the only thing i know how to do
9297215 we think pat white is an underrated passer i think its really going to help him as a pro prospect
9297216 when you score sometimes that makes up for time of possession
9297217 i just did a really poor job coaching this week i saw it about three days ago the offense was ugly tonight
9297218 we had stuff open and we didnt hit it and thats what weve got to do
9297219 were going to have some growing pains with this offense
9297220 but any time you rush for 300 yards youve had a pretty good night
9297221 its always a defensive linemans dream to get a sack back there
9297222 he was able to come around with a good press and i was able to scoop and score
9297223 ive been thinking about that big hit to start off the season ive even dreamed about it i dreamed about it friday night that was the best way to start off a season
9297224 anytime you turn over the first offensive play that makes it rough
9297225 i dont think that we played what i consider well more than three series in a row on either side of the ball
9297226 that was a pretty sloppy game and offensively we were pretty sloppy
9297227 weve got a long ways to go and a lot of room to get better
9297228 i think were going to find in a lot of them that we didnt have good technique and thats focus
9297229 to go out there and you know footballs real important for two or three series but its not important the next two after that thats madness
9297230 we have to get better and we have to improve
9297231 after the first quarter you catch up to the game speed that they have and after the second quarter it felt like a big sky game
9297232 we went out and made some good plays but just didnt make enough
9297233 a lot of people in the activist community are really on about whos next
9297234 our organization will continue we will be on the streets
9297235 we spent so much time trying to welcome people to the city and now this is the way we start out
9297236 we may have to look at that situation and try and monitor
9297237 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a national disaster
9297238 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9297239 if a governor decides to stay home then we will make changes to the schedule but as of today there are no changes
9297240 it is true that we are monitoring the situation of course and there is a chance we can change the schedule but at this time we have not made any changes
9297241 ive instructed my senate staff to monitor the situation closely
9297242 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a
9297243 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9297244 help me shake up washington and make it start working again for the people
9297245 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9297246 as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need
9297247 america knows this is john mccains agenda and we cant afford four more years of the same
9297248 during this most recent contest stephanie and i started off on different sides we would see each other and she would say to me this is what it means to be a friend and all i could say is i understand and that is a testimony to her and the kind of person she was
9297249 two leaders came together and they talked and she felt good about the conversation
9297250 theres a 6 year old who looks at me and says are you really the president and i said yes i am and he said youre not dead yet and well you know he thought the president was thomas jefferson a president was a dead white guy thanks to you senator no one will ever think that is the definition again
9297251 legislative accomplishments are few and far between because he cannot work well and bring people together and persuade them of a positive issue
9297252 its a lot closer to a revolution than to a routine day at the office
9297253 the republicans are about to nominate the only person in our party distinct enough from the rest to have a chance of winning in what ought to be a very bad year he is our most different candidate since teddy roosevelt
9297254 the overwhelming evidence that climate change is taking place argues that we address the issue
9297255 really focuses on government spending it would be a radical change for washington d c
9297256 hes taking sides in an internal republican fight between the appropriators who always want to spend more and the rest of the party i think he can win it because despite the cacophony of special interest protests hell have popular support
9297257 it was a fair evaluation of that position but it was also tough because both guys played well
9297258 i was obviously excited for me and the opportunity but im also disappointed for matt and know the position that hes in
9297259 there were a lot of things that we were looking at it was a whole bunch of information
9297260 part of being a good player is reining those emotions in and being able to control them that was one of the things that we got to see last night he was able to do that after last week
9297261 the bottom line is you just want to be on the football field and you want to play
9297262 i still feel like i can do that at a high level
9297263 have another chance to compete and hopefully take us to someplace we havent been in some time and have another run at a championship
9297264 as perceptive as bill bryson and often just as funny
9297265 nobody got hurt today a couple of guys had little things but if it were the regular season they could have kept playing
9297266 that was good to see and then get him out of there before anything happened to him
9297267 you see it every day in practice but when you see it out there in the game it looks great
9297268 youd wish one of those runs would pop just to see him in the real open field and the chance to really run away
9297269 just to see that breakaway speed that he has but well wait to see until the regular season
9297270 reece is very explosive with the ball and he made a great play on the touchdown there
9297271 i didnt get many plays today but i feel that on the plays that i had i did my best
9297272 im debating whether to go to sacramento to be with my girlfriend and my baby or just stay in oakland and weather the storm
9297273 the itunes business model works brings in money for us too but we lack price differential control apple wont let us we hate that
9297274 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century
9297275 the itunes business model works brings in money for us too but we lack price differential control apple wont let us we hate that
9297276 a newspaper in the tradition of columbians hamilton and jay
9297277 a libertarian a conservative and a socialist although no one knows which was which
9297278 this is the way we duck the flying fork wash our paws the spouse and the wall
9297279 and she was left with only her husband bill for company
9297280 but we didnt see that it would be wildly out of line
9297281 im not sure anybody on any side would have predicted that
9297282 we made the agreement before all the details were worked out
9297283 over time we had a number of teachers that really did not engage in professional learning
9297284 we were looking for a way to keep our teachers on top of their game
9297285 i think that rewarding teachers for improving their skills as opposed to longevity is a positive move
9297286 it will give an incentive for top notch people to want to be in education rather than go out and get a job in business
9297287 rather than seeking to create a pay scheme built on measurement of student performance
9297288 this systems goal is to encourage teachers to remain career long learners to increase and update their skills and to be visible models as learners to their students
9297289 we are pleased about our roster heading into the 2008 season
9297290 im satisfied with the process we went through to get to this point including minicamp training camp and the preseason our coaching staff did a good job guiding our players over the past five months and im very proud of the team our staff put together im looking forward to starting the regular season
9297291 im dealing with a very difficult very personal issue and i know this is not the solution
9297292 i said i might just be writing my career off right now
9297293 ive had 17 great years and theres no guarantee what the future holds but you wont know unless you take that chance and i was thinking that
9297294 i think now that im here that part is over and done with
9297295 no one in that locker room is worried about it not once has a guy said hey sit down and tell me what happened they may want to know or whatever but were too busy and im having a blast
9297296 its been hard but really i know i made the right decision
9297297 everyday i would wake up and say boy id like to play at some point in the day id go ahh i dont know with each day that passed i got more and more committed to do it and that was all i was looking for from day 1
9297298 as time passed by i said you know ive still got the fire
9297299 i finally got to a point where i was committed and to me that includes everything
9297300 ive always considered myself the ultimate teammate regardless of how ive been portrayed this year
9297301 the day i told mccarthy i was going to retire he said are you sure
9297302 i said no im not sure but you want an answer and im giving you an answer im not sure
9297303 now i couldve told them all right ill come back even though at that time i didnt want to
9297304 and then july rolls around and we start camp and i go god i just aint got it and then just walk away well to me that was worse than saying guys if you want an answer right now im just not 100 percent committed and because of that im retiring i was just honest with them
9297305 i always liked ted and i dont want to say i dislike him now
9297306 what the hell am i going to do with a locker anyway
9297307 i started getting the impression in may that boy i feel like i need to play
9297308 the tough part was how do i get myself out of this jam
9297309 when he picked up the phone again after he dropped it he said oh god brett
9297310 he said brett playing here is not an option those were his exact exact words
9297311 theres no guarantees i come back and i play as well as i did last year but if youre a betting man and you said ok who gives us the best chance to win right now and this is not bragging but i would think i would
9297312 aaron may play great and then they all look like geniuses but to not welcome me back and im just assuming for fear of upsetting aaron not only now but in the future is totally ridiculous totally ridiculous
9297313 the next day i told him mike dont worry about coming down or dropping by
9297314 they made it sound like they had chartered a plane just to see me and i had made a call and said im coming back which is not true
9297315 mike called me on the phone and i couldnt get him to shut up
9297316 i didnt want to go anywhere including green bay and go through a bad season and lose and get beat up and everyone say what the hell did he come back for
9297317 now that could happen here it could happen in green bay and it could happen anywhere ive always felt like i give whatever team im on a good chance to win but theres way more to it than one guy
9297318 the bottom line was that i wanted to play and i felt like this team had a good chance to win it would be difficult as it would be anywhere but i felt like this would be a good fit for me
9297319 i dont know what we could ask more from our guys they worked their butts off
9297320 but having them in those games is more important than taking the risk right now
9297321 i think weve gotten done what we need to get done on the practice field but its a different speed
9297322 the guys who havent played at this point are veteran guys
9297323 in a perfect world they wouldve played and they wouldve played 20 snaps or so at this point its not in our best interests and not in their best interests its not perfect
9297324 if you look around the league its a similar situation we had 40 guys who never missed a practice
9297325 the itunes business model works brings in money for us too but we lack price differential control apple wont let us we hate that
9297326 he served his country and he did a good job as a serviceman i will honour him for that but he is not presidential material
9297327 that corner of veterans and mercer looked fantastic in corn and beans
9297328 business arent not delivering to the west side because of safety its because they say it is
9297329 dont buy into the west side hype i am a truck driver and believe me if we feel unsafe we will go elsewhere and there are other places to go within a decent logable distance
9297330 i think it says a lot that catlbyer16 wont stay at our west side hotels because the food delivery people wont go there
9297331 catlbyer16 there are very very few sections of this city that are not safe and this location is hardly dangerous
9297332 to events and who cares as someone who comes to your area several times a year do not count the motels west of interstate 55 74
9297333 i agree we need a grocery store on this side of town
9297334 another shopping center for those of us getting 2 pay raises while prices have escalated at least 50 over the last year
9297335 are you the same people who complain about the government taking away our rights the article did not mention any tax incentives for the purchase nor did it mention any of you wanting to purchase the property
9297336 wow sounds like its going to take an already overcongested area and turn it into a traffic nightmare
9297337 i think his clothes always spoke to very different generations from the youth to the establishment
9297338 through imagery through his campaigns most importantly he always created a product and whatever category it was it was something to be proud of something that you always felt like you wanted to have theres an element of endurance of timelessness
9297339 anything ive wanted to do ive done anyone ive wanted to be with ive had
9297340 it might have bothered the kids a little more than it bothered me
9297341 if they score there it looks like a little different ballgame
9297342 that was a beautiful pass just the way we drew it up
9297343 we put in that 6 3 defense a couple days ago to use as our goal line defense
9297344 some idiot in the pinko commie tax leech business group at the expense of

9297349 a gt gt scientist of mediocre skills and great ambition
9297350 his whole campaign is a beautifully presented illusion and the way to defeat it is to keep hammering on the difference between illusion and reality because the more grandiose the illusion the more thoroughly it will be rejected when it is revealed as a lie

9297362 we all know that the system has not been completed to withstand the 100 year storm level which is set to be in place by 2011

9297368 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9297369 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9297370 governor palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade they both want to continue the failed economic policies of the bush administration and they both offer more of the same that has led this country down the wrong path
9297371 mccain clearly sees the power of women voters in this election but has just as clearly failed to support any of the issues that they care about

9297394 what happened in georgia is a good sign one that means america is no longer the sole world power setting the rules of the game
9297395 there is a balance in the world now russia is resurging which is good for us for the entire middle east
9297396 this russian invasion of georgia is a turning point in the relations of the atlantic community with russia including of course turkey

9297398 the start of the conventions and the announcements of the vp candidates has truly triggered this election season

9297415 in hoeverre is iets een bedreiging voor nl en de rechtsorde
9297416 we didnt get no bcs bowl or nothing like that i think the guys are really excited about this season because of the expectation level that people are setting for us
9297417 the key is this can we get all of the returning starters back on defense playing better than they did a year ago
9297418 if we want to have a real good year thats it we just werent a very experienced football team last season hopefully well play better defense from page one
9297419 our defense from this camp to last camp is totally different in every aspect that it could possibly be
9297420 ive missed more coverages in two a days than i had ever just for the fact that theyre disguising so much more they have so many more blitz packages and capabilities because the guys know what theyre doing
9297421 we have to get up in there try and penetrate and stay in the backfield if we get out there and play as a unit well be good
9297422 it makes us not have a lot of pressure on ourselves to go out and score 40 points a game
9297423 we can win the 21 14 games if need be
9297424 starting the season off in your hometown is something that not a lot of guys get to do its just a good way to set the stage for the season
9297425 the beauty of our offense is that we can put him on the field anywhere we want to
9297426 that frees him up and allows him to do a little bit more
9297427 hes just such an explosive playmaker that it gives us a new dynamic on the offensive side of the ball
9297428 teams are going to have to double or triple team someone like him
9297429 if he is lined up against me then it will make for better competition and if hes not then hes not
9297430 you just have to rise to the occasion and hopefully come out on top
9297431 in order to achieve what you want to achieve you have to take it one game at a time
9297432 right now the only game on that schedule is illinois
9297433 well practice with the sound and make it extra loud to get communication problems solved
9297434 id rather get up and say lets just go play to be honest with you
9297435 i think sitting around is difficult on a first game basis because youve been waiting and practicing for this game since august 4 and now on game day you have to wait until 7 p m to kick it off theres a lot of wasted energy and nervous energy thats expended on that day
9297436 im not sure it is for my players sometimes because watching it just gets their blood pumping
9297437 jake locker is a tremendous athlete a tremendous quarterback and a tremendous competitor he is in my opinion probably the most difficult weapon to defense in division i football
9297438 hes faster than you think hes stronger than you think and he possesses a very strong arm you have to be aware every single play where he is
9297439 the guys are running around good their energy level is good
9297440 i think physically theyre ready and mentally theyre ready were tired of talking about it we want to play
9297441 everyones saying we have to win if we dont win were going kill you
9297442 im not buying into it just yet i need one hit and then ill buy into it real quick
9297443 i want to go out there and have no mental errors go out there and make every block make every catch and hopefully also make some big plays that can help us win too
9297444 us seniors want to go off with a bang as a team we want to start the season off right
9297445 were ready to go against some new blood other than ourselves
9297446 the state of colorado definitely gets excited for this game
9297447 its always great to play in an nfl stadium thats that gorgeous with such a great field and its always a great thing to play in a place that a lot of the guys on the field dream to be in one day
9297448 i think expectations are high i think weve got a really talented group there
9297449 i dont know if one guy is gonna catch 60 balls but id love to see three guys combine to catch those 60 balls in a variety of ways
9297450 some guys making the big plays some guys converting on third downs
9297451 i want it to be just as big a part of our offense as it was last year
9297452 we might have to do it as a group i think they have their strengths and were gonna try to play to those line them up and put them in spots to get the ball
9297453 anthony mccoy has given us real stability jimmy millers had his best camp by far he came out of nowhere and i think the addition of blake ayles he really looks like a real playmaker at the position
9297454 hes fast hes light on his feet in changing direction he catches everything hes very physical hes a very tough kid
9297455 hes kinda in the race of trying to learn enough stuff that he can contribute right now but were gonna use him
9297456 i think youll see plenty of anthony mccoy but i think the other two guys are going to play extensively
9297457 were expecting us to come out to play every game
9297458 whatever the coach wants us to do were gonna go out there and do it for him
9297459 they want us to catch were gonna catch they want us to block well block were gonna be 100 percent on all assignments when fred was here he did what he did now hes gone were going to come out here and do our own thing
9297460 weve been able to utilize two guys wed like to stick with that
9297461 were going to stick with the two tight ends maybe three maybe four maybe five
9297462 free to assemble and protest without jackbooted thugs crying 9 11 9 11 9 11 hauling them in without probable cause
9297463 its so insidious the way it turns your mind against you
9297464 its the closest i can imagine to hearing voices or being possessed it really does feel alien like something else is at work inside you
9297465 the most tragic consequence is the psychiatric spiral it causes
9297466 we know children of mothers with postpartum depression have more emotional problems as adults for instance they struggle to develop and sustain healthy relationships
9297467 new mothers are very sensitive to the idea they should be good mothers that their maternal function is paramount
9297468 when they perceive theyre failing in that role it creates both shame and a tendency to conceal it
9297469 the goal is to make postpartum depression a more mainstream conversation
9297470 thats the first step in getting women to realize they can do something about the problem
9297471 i would hope anyone who feels the way i did would see a doctor and if the doctor brushes her off she should find another
9297472 no one should have to deal with it themselves no one deserves to feel that way
9297473 the research only began in the late 1980s early 1990s
9297474 the social world was thought to be too complicated to be studied scientifically but the brain is being sculpted by the demands of the social world its fundamental
9297475 sometimes we dont look at the value that they can bring to kids
9297476 and so theyve lived through a lifetime of things so they have a lifetime of knowledge and we probably can learn something from that knowledge
9297477 ive been waiting for transformers to be released on blu ray for a long time and it was worth the wait
9297478 this is the complete high definition package for fans of this film it looks stunning and really allows you to engage with this movie in new ways remember i told everyone blu ray is the best
9297479 think of it as a dinner party thrown by revolutionaries
9297480 good food is not just for the middle class we want to make it accessible
9297481 when you take the time to do things right you are rewarded
9297482 the more you learn the more you realize you dont want to eat a lot of whats being shipped into supermarkets
9297483 i dont want to serve something to my guests that i wont eat myself
9297484 we dont take time to eat and celebrate food were on the run putting things in our body that dont make sense
9297485 this is a very grass roots effort that connects young artists environmentalists and young people all of whom are engaged for their own reason
9297486 we have to meet each other and understand our power as a group
9297487 it undercuts one of the points they are making that she is an ethical reformer
9297488 governor palin has been fully cooperative in this situation and has nothing to hide she has been a leader and proven reformer demanding accountability and transparency from alaskas government which resulted in landmark ethics legislation

9297492 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up
9297493 it can take several days for the subsea wells typically about half of our production comes back rather quickly
9297494 bill read got up in the middle of that interrupted it and said theyve just upped the category to a category 5 storm that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the golf coast to really pay attention
9297495 if a governor decides to stay home then we will make changes to the schedule but as of today there are no changes
9297496 it is true that we are monitoring the situation of course and there is a chance we can change the schedule but at this time we have not made any changes
9297497 it could be this or could be that or could be the other thing
9297498 it could be this or could be that or could be gt the other thing
9297499 there are some very basic rights that clearly have to be applied
9297500 the governor is the only person that has the authority to remove him from office she should have thought of this before she embroiled herself
9297501 the issue was is there middle ground that both parties could live with to serve the interests of justice clearly there wasnt

9297508 i will not plead in line with my standpoint as regards this court
9297509 an old story by one of the worst mass murderers in the world
9297510 i have found the right partner to help me stand up to those who value their privileges over their responsibilities who put power over principle and put their interests before your needs
9297511 i found someone with an outstanding reputation for standing up to special interests and entrenched bureaucracies someone who has fought against corruption and the failed policies of the past
9297512 three days ago i called my mother back in tibet
9297513 she said hello and that she was okay then she asked if i was okay and after i said yes she just put down the phone i felt in that moment the tense division in tibet
9297514 i saw one person carrying a knife pursuing me i escaped very quickly cutting through a field to get through to the village
9297515 a compelling person with a terrific personal story im sure that she will help make the case for republicans
9297516 ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket he wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming governor palin agrees with him and his policies
9297517 i think you just figured out why i chose joe biden
9297518 because heres a man who wasnt born with a silver spoon in his mouth
9297519 one more indicator of this country moving forward one more hit against that glass ceiling
9297520 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9297521 even though it may be difficult not to react to the market remember that saving for retirement is a marathon not a dash
9297522 history shows that the pain of a down market doesnt last forever losses from market declines are merely paper losses until the asset is actually sold
9297523 whether the current bear market has reached a bottom or not is unclear but one thing we know from this study is that market gains have more than made up for losses for those investors who stayed invested over the long term
9297524 the market has always recovered but by trying to predict the best time to buy and sell investors may miss the markets biggest gains
9297525 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
9297526 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
9297527 never before have i been so moved or enraged by a play
9297528 a campaign of doubt was run by the parents of private cheryl james see picture whose body was found beside her gun her death like those in similar circumstances of ptes benton gray and collinson was attributed to suicide the play rigorously and shockingly makes the case that all were cases of murder or at the least manslaughter
9297529 michael richard and dan are the only newly ordained priests for dublins million plus catholics
9297530 author malachi odoherty argues that our irish experience has news for the fundamentalists who think nothing ever changes but also for the hard atheists who dont understand religious culture from the inside ireland is on the cusp between faith and atheism free now to think freshly about both
9297531 and i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9297532 in the space of 10 months weve gone from a position where people generally felt we were doing ok to where were certainly not doing ok weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment people are pissed off with us
9297533 yes i do think he can i do think he will
9297534 well its always difficult you know you can always say what could you have done better and all the rest of it but gordon in september up to party conference has got the opportunity to do that and he will do that its absolutely imperative
9297535 well thank god i didnt have to go there on millennium night
9297536 at times he seems almost too straightforward even high minded for the low cunning of political warfare
9297537 a little flat and not just because of its now required state of the union laundry list passages
9297538 the stupidity of it that somehow the idea that it is all over in northern ireland and there is no need for an envoy this of all things
9297539 its hard for me to fathom how anyone who knows anything about ireland would say this this is a signal that the u s government will detach if he obama wins the operative word is detachment
9297540 senator john mccain has selected alaska gov sarah palin to be his running mate according to us republican party sources
9297541 huge contrasts found between uk nations patients in the uks four nations have dramatically different experiences of the nhs
9297542 dr nick goodwin from the kings fund health think tank said the data should be interpreted with caution as it is collected differently in each area he also warned that the data did not take in to account existing health inequalities or the infrastructure in place before different policies were adopted by each government
9297543 mr robinson said he wanted an immediate executive meeting to deal with the issue before it becomes a matter for the courts
9297544 i dont think its involves any deep seated policy differences
9297545 im told of around 150 changes many involve references to northern ireland being changed to the north
9297546 basically once a document is passed by the executive then thats it it should be put out in that form
9297547 ultimately it could go to the courts but i think its more a case of symbolising the bad relations there are at the moment
9297548 i think people have become complacent and they have not understood what would happen if an economy starts to slow fast if firms start to close what we have now is a turning point in many ways certainly you might think of it as a paradigm shift we have a global financial crisis an oil shock coming and people with little experience of what is really going on
9297549 first minister to authorise grants despite wifes outspoken comments 80 000 to gay groups within the next seven months despite his wifes controversial views on homosexuality
9297550 the coalition on sexual orientation coso contributed to the 2007 and 2008 belfast gay pride parade awarding 5 750 and 5 000 from a fund of 230 000 which was awarded by the previous direct rule administration
9297551 what is needed from the devolved administration at stormont is a set of policies to take account of the different population profiles in the catholic and protestant communities to answer their different needs and stop following the outdated nio mindset of trying to pretend that everything here would be ok if everyone started behaving as if they lived in england
9297552 in january five north belfast protestant clergy wrote to the unionist oriented news letter complaining of the failure of the executive to tackle sectarianism they wrote we have poor inter community relationships effective apartheid in housing across our villages towns and cities community division exemplified in but not confined to the physical structures of peace walls slow pace of reconciliation sectarianism and fractured educational provision our real angst is that a suggested programme for government almost totally fails to acknowledge these profoundly difficult issues exist the response from the dup junior minister in ofmdfm mr donaldson was that power sharing was the shared interpretation which seemed to confuse politics as means with the ends it aimed to realise the draft programme for government had significantly replaced the language of a shared future with a better future inline with its prioritisation of the economy a much more convivial focus for members of the political class than the challenge of tackling the communal divisions in which they were so deeply implicated the revised pfg32 published by messrs paisley and mcguinness introduced the clumsy circumlocution of a shared and better future
9297553 is a matter the government has to consider in due course but we are not at that point in our discussions at all yet the point of discussion we are at at the moment is examining the outcome of the referendum and obviously there will be a lot meetings with eu colleagues between now and the end of the year where it will be discussed further with them so its not just a matter for our own personal consideration or national consideration it is a matter we have to discuss with colleagues as well
9297554 in every society there is a substantial gap between the life expectancy of the children of the most affluent and privileged and those who are born into deprivation but some countries are better than others at closing the gap
9297555 a boy in the suburb of calton glasgow can expect to live 28 years less than one raised in lenzie a few miles away one born in hampstead london will live around 11 years longer than a boy from st pancras five stops away on the northern line of the underground
9297556 even in these times when all the talk is of putting history behind us the easiest way to tell the difference between the irish and the english is to utter the word
9297557 i was myself assaulted and received death threats the depth of hatred that still exists in ireland is matched only by unawareness in non catholic english circles of what cromwell did in ireland i am reminded of gk chestertons remark that the tragedy of the english conquest of ireland in the 17th century is that the irish can never forget it and the english can never remember it
9297558 it was in accordance with the laws of war but it went far beyond what any general had done in england
9297559 this was ethnic cleansing on a scale undreamt of by slobodan milosevic
9297560 reverence for cromwell was one of the few socialist traditions that survived the transition from old to new labour
9297561 he was on the right side in the civil war and because of him the right side won he changed the course of english history and changed it for the better
9297562 until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved
9297563 it is increasingly a manifestation of republican frustration at the failure of sinn f in to deliver what it promised to its own movement
9297564 nationalists and republicans will once again be disappointed by the attitude being displayed by the sdlp
9297565 any commitments that were given by the government to sinn f in are a matter for the government but the dup made the situation perfectly clear before we left st andrews that we had not agreed to any dates for the transfer of powers
9297566 i say again that until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved it should not be taking on more especially a portfolio as contentious as justice
9297567 i was outside the family home when the raid began and i was inside immediately afterwards speaking with the family who are close friends of mine the reality of the ruc psni was here for all to see in broad daylight and the residents of this estate remain justifiably suspicious of the force
9297568 after everything ive got through already these early round matches it will only get better from here
9297569 im really happy to be playing well everybodys cheering me on so its a nice feeling
9297570 after everything ive got through already these early round matches it will only get better from here
9297571 im really happy to be playing well everybodys cheering me on so its a nice feeling
9297572 the first series i had a couple overthrown balls and you know some miscues with the receivers but a couple series is all it took to get back on our feet
9297573 we werent planning on playing masoli as much as we did but we did have a plan to play chris harper
9297574 im proud of them they werent perfect but they made things happen
9297575 we were just trying to mix it up and give them a different look
9297576 when roper went down we werent sure what we were going to do
9297577 we understand we didnt play nearly as good as we can
9297578 were not good enough to come in and just show up and beat teams we gotta play as well as we can to win games
9297579 you go through times in the year where youre not very good and then you go through times when you are good
9297580 the last couple of days i got on base every time so its just one of those things
9297581 in my mind we thought wed be better the last couple of days we werent
9297582 the typical gen x or gen y will work for seven different employers across their career
9297583 if you consider the combination of the withdrawal behavior with that propensity for multiple employers i do think we are facing a savings challenge and crisis with this generation
9297584 our research revealed that younger generations are more likely to use credit than save for short term purchases which results in an ongoing struggle with debt management
9297585 theres a real instant gratification approach that they have and im not sure it just goes with age were seeing even in the folks in their early 30s they actually have workplace savings and change jobs then use it for other purposes
9297586 its surprising how many people just dont understand their options at termination
9297587 i think everybody thinks the same thing it wont happen to me
9297588 all the food borne illnesses that are floating around this country of ours theres anger toward that that canadians have to be subjected to this type of lackadaisical attitude toward food safety
9297589 i want her death to be counted and for people to know this is a real hazard out there
9297590 whether listeria was the actual cause or the underlying cause is very difficult to determine
9297591 many of our recalls relate to products such as sandwiches and pre packaged meats carrying best before dates that have now already expired
9297592 nevertheless in the public interest and in the interest of openness we feel it is important that such info is visible
9297593 were simply not placing the alcohol based product in our schools
9297594 handwashing using plain soap and water is still the most important way to reduce the spread of germs
9297595 we are conducting this study to show further evidence that patients who stay on treatment achieve long term clinical benefits even after 15 years
9297596 because of the chronic nature of ms it is important for patients to start on an effective therapy as soon as possible to help reduce relapses delay physical disability progression and protect to help prevent future disability

9297600 mr pirouz is far from being a mule or a carrier
9297601 its difficult to understand how he could organize an international smuggling scheme
9297602 it was great fun choosing these books and it was hard to limit myself to 40 i could have picked 400 or 4 000
9297603 but there was enough room for a bit of variety including childrens books funny books poetry a real selection
9297604 i tried to avoid including the obvious choices such as hamlet and i didnt bother with paradise lost because i know that by heart
9297605 it took me a lifetime to put this collection together ive still got copies of most of them
9297606 an immensely funny book about depression written in a very prolix ornate style
9297607 peace co operation and mutual assistance with abkhazia and south ossetia
9297608 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
9297609 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
9297610 a step towards further escalation of tensions with russia and the desire to drive the situation into an even worse deadlock
9297611 we hope that common sense will prevail over emotions and that eu leaders will find the strength to reject a one sided assessment of the conflict neither party needs the confrontation towards which some countries are being energetically pushed by the eu
9297612 further sliding to confrontation with russia and attempts to put pressure on us are unacceptable as they can entail irreversible consequences in the military political climate and in stability on the continent
9297613 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing
9297614 if things remain as they are and the regime for chinese migrants is not tightened several decades from now they will be in a position to vote in a referendum for acceding to china
9297615 the us should let the eu stew in their own mess
9297616 will putin give passports to russians living in brighton beach new york
9297617 the us should let the eu stew in their own mess
9297618 its always disappointing but its a program that the league has set up and something that i understand and jesse understands the consequences of
9297619 jesse has had a very good training camp and really punctuated it with his game against the eagles hes disappointed and so am i but i look forward to him being able to come back and contribute
9297620 never tested positive for a steroid or any other performance enhancing drug
9297621 near the end of last season the league claimed he had a diuretic in his system that they said could also be used as a masking agent
9297622 after jesse spent great time and money defending his innocence the league made its final ruling and now he has no choice but to look ahead to week 5
9297623 i respect the program the league has in place and its very clear that if theres a violation there are consequences
9297624 my experience with jesse since hes been a new york jet has been extremely positive i think hes done everything weve asked him to do
9297625 tony richardson has run the ball in the past and wide receiver can be used back there as well so well definitely have alternatives in place
9297626 had this not gone through he would be on the 53 man roster
9297627 in terms of evaluating him as a player and a contributor i think he earned that spot from that perspective
9297628 plenty of people post under their real names and do not attempt to hide

9297636 he has been co operating with investigators and weve had the opportunity to sit down with him and get his version of the events
9297637 everyone that went to the hospital is still in the hospital
9297638 they are grieving they went through a horrific event and theyre doing as well as could be expected given the circumstance
9297639 in visiting backstretches and knowing trainers i dont think i put a blind eye to anything but i dont think i saw conditions as bad as they are here
9297640 i had seen the people with the clipboards with my own eyes
9297641 ive never spoken to them though they were doing their own business and that was no business of mine
9297642 i would like saratoga to be the same as gulfstream
9297643 a solution would be building three to four story buildings for employees
9297644 we spend thousands of dollars each year to train these guys to go overseas and fight a war
9297645 then we bring them back and do very little to integrate them back into society some begin self medicating because of what theyve experienced their drinking often turns to drug use which leads to crime
9297646 they stood up for us in war and we need to stand up for them when they return
9297647 the battle mind that keeps them alive and safe over there is what gets them in trouble here
9297648 they use women and children against us americans have a goodness and trust factor more so than a lot of other countries they go from house to house not knowing if the next door they open will be a terrorist or a child they have to make split second decisions that are very difficult and very nerve racking
9297649 a lot of times they come back and try to fill the adrenaline rush they experienced over there
9297650 other times they come back to find that their normal responsibilities have been taken over by their spouse they may feel unneeded thats when they begin looking for ways to cope
9297651 i mirrored what they had and catered it to the court system in oklahoma we got everyone together in courts to discuss it and came up with the best plan to start a pilot program
9297652 with so many vets returning to the fayetteville area i wanted to take the program and try to do something in northwest arkansas and hopefully one day across the state
9297653 right now im trying to lobby senators state reps legislators mayors judges all the key players i need their support
9297654 i think were obligated to provide care for our veterans
9297655 the women and men of the armed forces allow us to maintain our freedom and our way of life theyre the heroes and heroines of our country
9297656 the same rules would have to apply to them in terms of violence background sexual predators and drug trafficking
9297657 there are some people who belong in prison otherwise if they dedicate themselves to treatment i would be interested in helping in any way i could
9297658 there are a lot of issues facing these guys that dont effect other people with normal jobs when you spend 12 to 15 months over there it becomes very normal they become used to following a structured regimen its difficult when they come back to find that everything has changed they have all this free time and time and sometimes it gets them in trouble
9297659 i am looking at flight patterns dove tend to go down fence lines tree lines a power line a draw or even a rise any topography change
9297660 we have noticed decoys over the last several years have become popular and they do work well
9297661 a lot just stick them out in front of them and they dont get any height getting them up higher works best
9297662 camo is important and movement is important if you are behind a bush or in the shade you can move a little bit more if you are in the open and make any kind of movement especially after the first two or three days they will start flaring on you
9297663 its just a wonderful gritty environment theres a sense of discovery
9297664 they had the large population the industrial living you had three and four families living in a dwelling
9297665 the strip district was an ideal place for us to start
9297666 there really arent many chain stores around here its like local mom and pop businesses and the strips kind of become like a gourmet foodie destination
9297667 people come down to get fresh ingredients and unique stuff and just to walk around
9297668 pittsburgh is a community town and thats why everybody that lives here loves it
9297669 pittsburgh isnt the type of town that you go to that has strip malls
9297670 i wanted to grow my hair long and stop wearing suits
9297671 culinary tours are really offered everywhere all of the big cities
9297672 so it was just a matter of time that pittsburgh needed to offer it as well
9297673 when we last met here in jackson hole the nature of the financial crisis and its implications for the economy were just coming into view
9297674 i used to think the south jersey corn is the best corn
9297675 sherrod brown tells me the ice cream and the peaches and the corn are the best in ohio i didnt know that
9297676 dont let anybody in south jersey know im buying this corn
9297677 a lot of people may choose that they dont want to take a risk they know how quickly weather can change and that may discourage a lot of travelers from traveling any distance this weekend
9297678 we want to get home before the contra flow starts
9297679 a lot of cancellations were going on but its now picking up
9297680 deforestation has to fall more and the conditions for sustainable development have to improve
9297681 sentendo anche altre persone parrebbe interessante dare continuit a via alviano
9297682 nel piazzale potrebbero trovar posto un ampio parco scuola con segnaletica orizzontale e verticale semafori ecc per educare i bambini e ragazzi alla circolazione stradale delimitato in maniera adeguata e raggiungibile da una ciclabile sia da via alviano che da vie vicine tale parco scuola
9297683 il tar si riservato di decidere si parla di anni avevamo per richiesto in attesa di concludere il complesso iter la sospensiva urgente della delibera per ottenere concretamente il ripristino della situazione precedente a detta di tutti gli utenti di livello ottimo ieri invece il tribunale ha stabilito che non v alcuna urgenza di sospendere latto
9297684 plenty of people post under their real names and do not attempt to hide
9297685 meanwhile you are the ugliest pigfucker in the universe you are the
9297686 plenty of people post under their real names and do not attempt to hide
9297687 meanwhile you are the ugliest pigfucker in the universe you are the
9297688 pittsburgh is a blue collar town and id like to think thats the type of person i am in my background and my work ethic
9297689 and i think that is reflected in our football team
9297690 ill tell you what they picked the right guy for the job
9297691 he brings so much to the university hes just a pittsburgh guy
9297692 dave wannstedt is a great not good great coach thats what concerns me the way they are building and putting together theyre the real deal
9297693 those things happen in the game and i think that at the university of pittsburgh our chancellor and now with athletic director steve pederson coming on you know weve got good solid people that understand whats involved theyre intelligent enough to know why things happen
9297694 weve had a couple of disappointing seasons in the past
9297695 so were definitely trying to get that tradition back and i can see us getting it back
9297696 its just a reminder that you know a lot of schools talk about winning a championship you read it in books
9297697 and i think all the ring does its a reminder that hey weve been there weve done it we have that tradition its live its not something youre reading about in storybooks
9297698 its motivation motivation from guys who actually did it before
9297699 anyone who comes back and gives advice its always good its helped us bond as a team
9297700 he loves the university everything about it he loves he tells the stories about when he was here its just a tradition you can just see it from talking to him for just a few minutes and thats just one of the things we need to get back we need that tradition
9297701 i dont want to put a set number on yards
9297702 but hopefully with gods graces itll be in the thousands or even higher
9297703 i dont think jeremiah is going to sneak up on anybody
9297704 in some regards jeremiah was the dominant back in several of the games he played in with jonathan last year
9297705 without a doubt hell be the premier back here and i think he deserves it
9297706 i think if he wouldnt have been hurt this past season he probably would have been leaving along with stew
9297707 im just ready to see how my knee will hold up against them when i get hit or when people try to hit me low im just really excited for aug 30
9297708 like i was saying with jonathan two heads are better than one and even with andre crenshaw three heads are better than two
9297709 hes making full speed cuts and he doesnt seem to be favoring it at all and im confident that hell be ready to go
9297710 with a very young team we thought it would be an opportune time not only to see a country and have the experience of a lifetime but also to have ten days with our young team getting them prepared for this season
9297711 for us as coaches and as a team its ten days that we dont ever get to work in the summertime
9297712 living over there myself foreign travel really opened up the world to me
9297713 italy has a pretty good basketball program and i think its an incredibly cultural and educational experience for athletes
9297714 the way they eat i think is just so healthy and so proper the italians live to eat whereas we eat to live thats just an important part of their day
9297715 its almost a ritual to sit down for a family meal its very seldom that you see people drinking coffee in their car you take time to sit in the cafe or stand in the cafe and drink it with your mind focusing on the coffee slowing down and eating is important
9297716 its not like this is a trip for fun this is a trip for business and fun theyve been trying to prepare us for how the europeans play over there and its a little bit tougher than how we play over here i think itll be a good challenge for us
9297717 nobody likes the feeling that your teams not winning because of this group
9297718 i feel like every year ive been here its been kind of the same situation and every year you try and go out and you dont want people to believe that about your unit
9297719 when we talked about recruiting we saw that the greatest need that we had was to redevelop an offensive line here and that it mightve been the weakest spot on the football team when you go out and recruit a number of players it takes a period of time for the offensive line to develop
9297720 you have to have the right guys to fit into your system
9297721 to me our system is built around mobility and not that you cant have big guys but this is a game of speed in this day and age and guys have to be able to move when i first came here there were some weight issues and weve got them under control and taken care of weve got a good nucleus of players here that we can be good up front i really believe that
9297722 its not really a drastic change just a few tweaks here and there
9297723 hes put some more tools in our toolbox that we can use i think its been just changing the schemes up a little bit to better suit what kind of talent we have and how our guys are built
9297724 i feel like one of the biggest things that he came in and wanted to address was the misconception that were a bad o line
9297725 he wants to let other people know that its not that were a bad o line he feels that we just need to cut down on the mistakes
9297726 i think they have a tremendous amount of pride and i think theyve probably gotten more than their share of the blame
9297727 but thats the way it is we have to do a better job of what were doing up front we have to control the line of scrimmage and i think we can do that
9297728 twenty seconds to play fourth quarter appalachian state 34 michigan 32
9297729 we didnt execute we simply made too many mistakes and had too many missed opportunities
9297730 well i worry about that obviously because there are too many people around us saying about coastal carolina
9297731 you have to respect them i think what appalachian state did to michigan last year was an eye opener for everybody
9297732 you definitely dont want to be the next michigan team
9297733 you dont want to get beat at home by coastal carolina
9297734 appalachian state has made a name for all the small schools and given hope to all the small schools they proved that they can play and you cant breeze through youre early games
9297735 the first thing that comes to my mind is keep mistakes to a minimum give yourself a chance
9297736 we had very few penalties against michigan and our kicking game was solid those two things alone kept us in the game and gave us a chance and it turned out a mistake in the kicking game cost michigan dont try a bunch of crazy goofy things
9297737 i dont think they had played against that fast paced of an offense
9297738 we recruit for speed and think weve got some pretty good team speed
9297739 there is no question that change in our offensive philosophy was what put us on top
9297740 it gave us an opportunity to take advantage of our speed we upped our point production by 12 15 points per game running the spread allowed us to level the playing field
9297741 its guys like him that make our program what it is guys that may not have been highly recruited coming out of high school but are still great players theres no doubt in my mind he could play almost anywhere in the country having armanti always gives us a chance
9297742 it opened up a lot of opportunities for schools that were just on the cusp
9297743 it has made a big difference in the level of competition ill tell ya appalachian state looks like an awfully good football team and they played like champions so i think theres been a dramatic effect
9297744 if appalachian state can do it you can beat penn state
9297745 they got a quarterback that happens to run a 4 3
9297746 and he went 16 for 16 in the first half
9297747 everybody knows that app was the best team in fcs football and i think they caught michigan at a time when i dont think michigan might have taken them seriously
9297748 appalachian was faster than michigan and if you notice they had to block a field goal to still win that game
9297749 so an fcs team beating a top 20 bowl championship series team i think thats the only time its ever happened so thats very rare
9297750 that was great for fcs football but i wouldnt be sitting there looking at your watch counting on one of them things to happen again this season because thats the first time its ever happened
9297751 you just want to go up there do well and represent the university
9297752 its a sense of accomplishment for me just because mitch is such a good quarterback
9297753 you gotta prepare each week like you are going to play even if you arent going to play
9297754 these guys have worked really hard to play and they both deserve to play
9297755 the edge that anybody would have isnt very significant we just have to pick out someone that is going to go next
9297756 if mark is gone im assuming aaron gets the nod
9297757 ive just got to set my mind on staying in mentally
9297758 i still got three years its a long time for a lot of things to happen
9297759 everything was okay with the doctors tuesday night so hes going
9297760 it wasnt bad but i guess i just wanted to make it perfect
9297761 when things dont go the way i want them i want to make them all right but sometimes you dont have to do that
9297762 as far as being healthy for the game we are as good as we can hope
9297763 this is the most ive done since ive been hurt and i feel good
9297764 one thing i would like to say to you is this and ive talked to our team about this
9297765 this is not about me it is not about me this is about a team getting ready for a football season and were talking about this season were not talking about a future season or anything like that
9297766 and i would really appreciate it from you the media to not put the focus on something other that ive just talked about about this team and about this season anything else isnt fair to the kids
9297767 when i got there coach robinson his philosophy was totally different
9297768 it was his first time being a coach and i didnt want my career being kind of like a guinea pig somebody testing
9297769 i needed development and i think it was more for like nfl i needed a lot more development stuff that made me good like my physicality and my effort im not a flashy player im a blue collar east coast player i think hes looking for five star type of recruit
9297770 hes held up the lombardi trophy hes seen every level of football on and off the field so hes sophisticated and he understands that we need to get better
9297771 last year was definitely a setback so in that regard it was tough for people
9297772 in life you have a chance to do things that are fair and i thought this was fair
9297773 im not guaranteeing if you give somebody more time its going to work out but you do try to guarantee is fairness
9297774 i want to shake everything and every person in the program
9297775 and do what has to be done to make this thing push to the next level up until it happens everything needs to be shaken including me
9297776 he has little adrenaline rushes and thinks he has pads on sometimes
9297777 we also have a thing called the circle drill which is when two dudes start fighting
9297778 if nothing else they were enthusiasm guys an idea a minute
9297779 if he did get frustrated he did it behind closed doors
9297780 he never really showed that if something was to happen inside his head hes just gonna do what he has to do and thats just coach us and get us ready week in and week out he pretty much stays the same all throughout
9297781 i dont know if i made the statement shake things up
9297782 i dont think thats what its all about i think i talked about evaluating every detail i dont shake things up just to shake things up
9297783 i wouldnt want you to get the idea that at the end of last season we had to shake things up because we had a 2 10 season in some cases no stay the course
9297784 you have to remember we had about a month to do a search
9297785 to find a greg robinson with his resume thats why when we hired him nobody complained they all applauded
9297786 he bleeds orange probably wears orange everyday ill tell you theres not a guy in the country youd want to root for more than him
9297787 all three of my boys have it she had a smile that lit the whole community up she was very promising but god had another plan for her
9297788 my whole family has that positive attitude because thats the way i was raised just enjoy it because you cant play this game forever and im really blessed to be in the position that i am
9297789 hes really taken that next step into being more of a leader
9297790 last year as more of a younger guy he wasnt as vocal now were expecting him to take more of a vocal role as a guy who has proven himself on the field guys will rally around him and listen to what he has to say
9297791 before he really liked to screw around a lot and hes definitely cut down on it
9297792 hes more serious now because it could potentially be his future he just takes everything a lot more seriously and it really means a lot to him he is the leader
9297793 if guys are going to look at me as that im definitely going to try and be that and lead by example and with my voice
9297794 guys are definitely looking up to me and im ready to take on that role
9297795 tis we who lost in stormy visions keep with phantoms
9297796 older americans are hit by a one two punch of jobs and medical problems and the two are often intertwined
9297797 they discover that they must work to keep some form of economic balance and when they cant theyre lost
9297798 i paid the bills whether i ate or didnt whether i went to the doctor or not
9297799 id go to bed and all i had on my mind was bankruptcy
9297800 you have to cry and try and figure out what in the world could i do
9297801 for the number of dollars we will be risking the next two years profit margins are not going to be robust
9297802 people think theyre standing at the edge of a chasm
9297803 we dont want to get into a situation in which farmers are squeezed
9297804 u s recession and recovery u v or w shaped
9297805 theres been debate about whether its v shaped or u shaped
9297806 trying to make a desperate situation look sort of technical its not that much of a fuss the big boys can take care of it dont you worry
9297807 except the big boys here their trousers are getting a little short im afraid
9297808 were closer to the end than we are to the beginning
9297809 the future of the hive does not depend on full employment for all the worker bees
9297810 in fact an accident can put many bees out of action without compromising the hive as a whole
9297811 it was time to retake control over what was happening on the street
9297812 it could be this or could be that or could be the other thing
9297813 it could be this or could be that or could be gt the other thing
9297814 basically any industry where youve got workers out in the middle of nowhere
9297815 if you see a fire and have no connectivity you cant tell anybody
9297816 to have a satellite phone with you you can make that immediate call and get firefighters mobilized
9297817 drm hasnt worked and may never work to halt music piracy
9297818 youve got to give credit to illinois i thought they played a great game
9297819 i thought illinois quarterback juice williams played a phenomenal game made a lot of plays
9297820 my players were real disappointed and that really upsets me a little bit
9297821 ive been in this business a long time and when you win you enjoy it we didnt play an average team out there theyre a real good football team
9297822 were better than that and we cant make the mistakes we made and get behind a team of that caliber and expect to be able to come back
9297823 ill tell you one thing you enjoy winning you kidding me
9297824 this technology significantly reduces fuel oil and natural gas consumption
9297825 we really think this is a game changer for the renewables industry
9297826 its going to get us through the peak of the day by using excess energy at night
9297827 makes wind a very different kind of energy than it is today
9297828 the fujitsu siemens amilo which if nothing else is one of the most attractive netbooks weve seen yet the 8 9 inch amilo packs the obligatory atom processor running at 1 6 ghz to power the 1 gb of memory and 60 or 80 gb hard drive no ssds offered the amilo will be a windows xp device and has an expresscard slot something that is not that common on netbooks
9297829 gobble gobble goo were submariners who the f are you
9297830 while all submariners can beat up two skimmers at a time it gets dicier when its 3 on 1
9297831 ive practiced it a little bit at training actually ive tried to get the technique right but i need a little bit of practice barry said
9297832 ive tried it a couple of times on the ground but i havent been successful i need to do a bit more work with the doctor and the physio this week
9297833 it wasnt painful for me tadhg im not too sure about
9297834 the problem is when hes like that were a man down in defence
9297835 so if we were able to get him back on board it might help us a bit
9297836 i just spoke to tadhg about how nathan does it
9297837 his shoulder is that stuffed anyway i couldnt do any more damage
9297838 he said i got it half in so look ive only got another half to do and it should be right
9297839 it was probably that real intent to put pressure on the opposition team
9297840 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up
9297841 it can take several days for the subsea wells typically about half of our production comes back rather quickly
9297842 but were also working with local authorities to provide fuel along evacuation routes
9297843 appropriate planning is under way to allow for the safe shut down of refinery operations and the evacuation of refinery personnel as circumstances warrant
9297844 airline travel is airline travel its been bad for a long time
9297845 i suspect prices will go up fewer people will travel and if youre willing to pay the price it will be fine
9297846 despite this sluggish u s economy the general demand picture is better than it was post 9 11
9297847 in addition you have this consistent response across the board of airlines raising fares and adding fees
9297848 if somebody sees a good fare they should grab it
9297849 the reality is and i dont want to diminish this the industry is going to have to cover its costs
9297850 i think if oil prices continue to go down you will hear calls for relaxation of fuel surcharges but that doesnt mean they wont hike base airfares
9297851 what happened in the 30s was probably the worst drought in recorded history other studies from tree rings show previous droughts up to 40 years
9297852 weve reduced much of our tillage there is a special kind of planter that can put the seed into the soil without digging
9297853 hopefully were smart enough now where we can minimize the impacts
9297854 there are quite a few cases of these girls overdosing with opium just to get out of the situation
9297855 a county official going over the ancient records of smith the undertaker was appalled by the number of girls of the gem and houses of like repute who had committed suicide in those hard early 80s he said no one ever had known how many there were
9297856 miners were rough filthy guys not all that clean they didnt make much off the agreement they had most of it went to whoever owned the house
9297857 in one of the whorehouses a girl was very very ill
9297858 the madam and some co workers carried her out of the house they lay on a hillside and virtually nobody helped them
9297859 as far as the actual working conditions once we got out of the tunnels it was a relatively safe job we had good contractors and safety meetings
9297860 i only know of one person who ever got killed in one of the dams
9297861 when i helped him out of that cable his arm was hanging there and all i could see was blood
9297862 the tallest ones were about 80 to 100 feet tall
9297863 at that time it wasnt scary but after awhile it got to be after you started thinking about it
9297864 we were show offs up there people used to stand on the street looking up watching us hoping we would fall we did a lot off a swinging stage a platform with block and tackle on the outside painting and putting metal on the building
9297865 if i was single and i was wandering around probably so it was interesting at the time it was one of the better paying jobs around 1 90 an hour we got a christmas bonus which was quite a bit at the time but no insurance
9297866 you always fear and that is what you want the fear makes you safe
9297867 you are careful it is your life and you may not get another chance
9297868 it was scary at first i know it could happen again
9297869 there were still plenty of them and those fill up after a while
9297870 at one point it was said there was as much sewage in the sioux falls river as there was water
9297871 this created a drive to get a sewage treatment plant
9297872 it shows that despite an extremely hostile environment unions can grow
9297873 the difference is that under this legislation the workers not the employers choose how workers vote for their union
9297874 the concern that employers have is that these authorization cards could be a very poor indicator of employees true feelings
9297875 employers feel they should have the ability to talk to employees and employees should have the ability to hear both sides and then go into a booth and vote in private
9297876 the much more dangerous part of this statute is the second part
9297877 its a disfavored concept because neither is usually wild about giving up the ability to get what they want
9297878 what is essential for union growth and rebirth is labor law reform we have a situation now that makes it exceedingly difficult for workers to organize and bargain collectively if they face any strong employer opposition
9297879 this would give unions a fair chance if workers want to belong to a union it would help level what has become a very lopsided playing field
9297880 that was always a much smaller part of the scene on the west coast and has insulated california from much of the national decline
9297881 the other factor is the very strong public sector here thats a lot of what is driving this

9297957 theres no other choice this is how it has to be
9297958 i think your thighs may be getting a little heavy
9297959 its no ones fault thats something thats so hard for people to understand
9297960 there is a feeling of guilt perhaps we encouraged her too much
9297961 we were a close family the success of anyone in the family was the success of the entire family she never wanted to let us down
9297962 she always trained very hard shed be up at six in the morning to go running
9297963 i cant remember them ever saying come on you have to do more
9297964 to the contrary if i didnt finish strong theyd point out that i had my best time and had improved but i was always looking at the negative
9297965 i was not as popular as some of the other students i was constantly comparing myself to others and coming up short instead of being thankful and glad for who i was
9297966 i remember the coach saying about all these girls whose careers went down the drain because they went away to college and didnt pay attention to their weight
9297967 they want their thinness they want their low body weight and they want their control
9297968 i didnt understand what was happening to me i just knew i was different
9297969 i thought if i could just gain weight it would go away i didnt understand the underlying problems that went with it
9297970 someone who has lost a lot of weight and is deep in the throes of anorexia it becomes all consuming you do not allow yourself to have food so all you think about is food
9297971 youre looking to people you care about and trust to have the answers and they didnt have one my family stood behind me and supported me but i felt very much alone
9297972 a person will go back to it in times of stress thats the battle for people trying to recover
9297973 all my friends were going off to school im going to stay home there was no choice
9297974 it was georgetown it had a good reputation academically and we thought id have a better chance getting help there than if i stayed in wilkes barre
9297975 there was a point i just didnt know what to do
9297976 it was very disconcerting i felt very alone and isolated i thought about food all the time and calories
9297977 i went from not eating anything to the point i ate food out of garbage cans
9297978 it was very upsetting to one day have a lot of promise and hope and the next day to feel like youre coming apart
9297979 everyone was saying get better soon get better mary just get better but i didnt know what to do to get better
9297980 i began to wish i had a physical illness like cancer or diabetes something you could take medicine for
9297981 i had not developed a rapport with a therapist so i couldnt start working on the issues thats when i really started to go down hill
9297982 i just looked at it as im a failure im lazy im no good
9297983 if i saw some semblance that i could get better i think i would have had more incentive
9297984 i was just tired of fighting i began thinking i have to take my life
9297985 i couldnt feel my legs but i felt everything was going to be all right
9297986 after i jumped became a turning point i began to have hope
9297987 youd think normally youd get worse i realized id been given a second chance
9297988 i came to understand people cared about me for who i was as a person not for just my achievements
9297989 i felt i had been saved for a purpose to help other people
9297990 i felt god was in control of my life and guiding me
9297991 a lot of people i treat have been to a lot of different therapists they have textbook knowledge but they dont really have an understanding
9297992 all the feelings and emotions they have ive been through they feel like i understand like they are not alone
9297993 but im convinced she will not only walk again she will run
9297994 it is a hard journey its one i think for me has been a test of perseverance
9297995 i think of myself as a piece of clay on a pottery wheel im constantly being reshaped and molded through different trials
9297996 there are lots of times i wanted to quit but i keep going
9297997 there have been some real challenges sometimes i ask why but i believe we are all called to finish the race before us for me this is my marathon

9297999 i guess its the old risk management of having your eggs spread out among many baskets
9298000 were learning as we go we really dont know the answer to that yet
9298001 were hopeful with the dusting which is something new were doing now well be able to at least contain the extent of this plague
9298002 even with the loss of almost 10 000 acres of prairie dogs conata basin still remains the largest and most important prairie dog complex on federal lands in the great plains its worth all these efforts to save it
9298003 theres the plague and the prairie dogs and thats nature taking care of the expansion
9298004 i think we want to get along we want to be able to survive just the same as the prairie dogs want to survive we dont want to annihilate them we dont just get them under control so theyre not sick give the ferrets something healthy to eat
9298005 deforestation has to fall more and the conditions for sustainable development have to improve
9298006 basically any industry where youve got workers out in the middle of nowhere
9298007 if you see a fire and have no connectivity you cant tell anybody
9298008 to have a satellite phone with you you can make that immediate call and get firefighters mobilized
9298009 from some of the ridge tops i can see 80 90 or 100 miles in any direction
9298010 if i see smoke i can get it reported very quickly i could have used it last year a lot thats for sure
9298011 basically any industry where youve got workers out in the middle of nowhere
9298012 if you see a fire and have no connectivity you cant tell anybody
9298013 to have a satellite phone with you you can make that immediate call and get firefighters mobilized
9298014 from some of the ridge tops i can see 80 90 or 100 miles in any direction
9298015 if i see smoke i can get it reported very quickly i could have used it last year a lot thats for sure
9298016 im extremely happy to be heading to tampa bay and i cant wait to take advantage of this opportunity we should have a great team and i cannot wait to get started
9298017 it got to a point where the money was too much for what we wanted to pay
9298018 we thought we had made a considerable offer but when there was the threat of an offer sheet at such an exaggerated dollar amount it really led us to believe that making a deal was an easier way and would give us the return that we needed for this player
9298019 hes a little more self conscious maybe when people are around
9298020 but when hes with his old gang he hasnt changed a bit its just like it was 25 years ago
9298021 early on in my affiliation with the practice i was talking to an elderly lady who was a patient of marks
9298022 she said i thought i was being robbed but it was dr yoffe making a house call on the motorcycle
9298023 he was never afraid of being who he was even when he was calling on an elderly lady at night
9298024 one thing that impressed me was that he made direct eye contact with me the whole time
9298025 i took part in the marine corps marathon in 2004 it had been 24 years since i ran a marathon
9298026 i ended up running on the second hottest oct 31 in washington d c history
9298027 i was honored and humbled to be nominated for man of the year
9298028 when they asked me to get involved i asked what do you have to do
9298029 we are so proud to have him associated with us and have him as one of our friends
9298030 i have to walk the line of reality with them but i have to have some optimism or i couldnt stay in the business
9298031 i guess any time something traumatic like this happens good people just crawl out of the woodwork
9298032 if people could just learn something from this how quick we can leave this world and be prepared
9298033 the construction must have taken a lot of manpower the palisade is an open structure which would not have been defensive and was too high to be practical for controlling livestock it certainly wasnt for hunting herded animals and so like everything else in this ceremonial landscape we have to believe it must have had a religious significance the most plausible explanation is that it was built at huge cost to the community to screen the environs of stonehenge from view basically we think it was to keep the lower classes from seeing what exactly their rulers and the priestly class were doing
9298034 this huge wooden palisade would have snaked across the landscape blotting out views to stonehenge from one side the other side was the ceremonial route to the henge from the river avon and would have been shielded by the contours the palisade would have heightened the mystery of whatever ceremonies were performed and it would have endowed those who were privy to those secrets with more power and prestige in modern terms you had to be invited or have a ticket to get in we hope to learn more about the structure which we lose track of on the other side of the main a303 trunk road because any remains were obliterated by the construction of a wartime airfield
9298035 they were the remains of 50 burials at stonehenge which were reburied in one hole in a complete mix up we think they were the bones of 50 kings and queens and may represent burials over a period of 1 000 years
9298036 the discovery of an industrial apiary at tel rehov constitutes a unique and extraordinary discovery that revolutionizes our knowledge of this economic endeavor particularly in ancient israel
9298037 tel rehov is so important because it contains a full apiary demonstrating that this was a large scale operation
9298038 we felt if we prayed and obeyed gods word and did what he asked that he would help us be successful
9298039 stanbury hill is a relatively undisturbed prehistoric moorland site as such it provides a unique opportunity for both archaeologists and the local community to learn more about the bronze age past especially the rock art as well as providing volunteers with the experience and skills of an archaeological dig at first hand supervised by a department of archaeology with a first class record
9298040 it is beyond any doubt the most important rock art site in north america
9298041 these images which are very sophisticated and very complex in representing supernatural beings turned out to be older than the cahokia mounds
9298042 push back a little earlier the continuity of prehistory in the region
9298043 that kind of symbolism is prevalent in the mississippian period
9298044 to discover an earlier birth of the period would connect the culture heroes of these works to an earlier time than anyone thought
9298045 it comes from a chariot and it shows something of the contacts these people had and their aspirations i suppose the chariot was the flashy run around of the period
9298046 how to avoid getting drafted if mcp o w wins
9298047 i found my short sexy short shorts but where the hell are my socks fuck it ill do it live
9298048 we the white godfearing citizens of rock ridge alaska wish to express our extreme displeasure with your choice of sheriff democratic nominee please remove him immediately the fact that you have sent him here just goes to prove that you are the leading asshole in the state
9298049 hey did you hear what they said on tv i didnt catch it all
9298050 mccain picked his vice president i think its that woman but i dont recognize her
9298051 shed only be the vp are you suggesting that john mcpow is going to die you ageist bastards
9298052 republicans are so ashamed of george w bush that they want to pretend the least eight years didnt happen
9298053 we all live in a yellow submarine a yellow submarine a yellow submarine
9298054 republicans are so ashamed of george w bush that they want to pretend the least eight years didnt happen

9298062 well as long as my taxes stay low fuck gay people
9298063 is sarah palin really the most qualified candidate to be john mccains running mate
9298064 palin worries me really really worries me i dont even want to wake up anymore also im tired of those uppity gays thinking for themselves instead of rolling over for the dems like good little nancys
9298065 been slapped awake by the undeniable fact that there is a slamming hottie on the gop ticket and there is nothing cooler than a slamming hottie young voters are back in play
9298066 well it might happen in kansas but i dont care because i dont live there
9298067 been slapped awake by the undeniable fact that there is a slamming hottie on the gop ticket and there is nothing cooler than a slamming hottie young voters are back in play
9298068 i can bring home the bacon fry it up in a pan
9298069 sure you have to eat dog food but at least youre not a mexislamahomo you know what we do to werebear said
9298070 ok god punished me by making me want to have sex with tom brady instead of giselle bundchen but if i vote gop maybe god wont be so angry oh and lower taxes
9298071 im a christian and so although i try not to have my religious beliefs dominate or determine my political views on this issue i do believe that tradition and my religious beliefs say that marriage is something sanctified between a man and a woman
9298072 giving them a set of basic rights would allow them to experience their relationship and live their lives in a way that doesnt cause discrimination
9298073 i think it is the right balance to strike in this society
9298074 a virtual guarantee of equality when it comes to benefits
9298075 stfu faggot and dyke take what scraps we give you and be happy with it punks
9298076 well take a little now well get to the rest later
9298077 commander of alaska national guard like 5 xenas and a sarah conner
9298078 why after all she is the commander in chief of the alaska national guard
9298079 mccain has given up obama will be elected because mccain has given up
9298080 ive always liked quoting numbers 25 when debating god botherers myself
9298081 the republican party is more southern than it has ever been in its history but you wont see anything proportionate to the representation of southern republicans in congress
9298082 these guys are modern republicans who run in unlikely places its mccains start to reach out to the middle
9298083 its like a beauty contest they put the speakers in front that will have the greatest appeal
9298084 we want to make sure we put forward the great diversity of the party
9298085 there is an effort to reach out to voters in traditional democratic states and that is consistent with the type of campaign john mccain is running
9298086 the program is reflective of the road traveled by the candidate on the way to the nomination
9298087 this is exactly what they did at the convention in 2004
9298088 the party wanted to present a moderate front because they realized it would most appeal to the general electorate
9298089 it will have a very serious impact on the convention
9298090 when one part of the country is getting hurt its hard to have a national celebration
9298091 the only way to get out of debt is to give to gods work
9298092 it doesnt take a whole lot of faith for 50
9298093 the long and short of it i think hes a con man
9298094 youre not ready to die even though as a christian youre prepared to die
9298095 then there are those days that i think man look at everything ive been through and im standing
9298096 it really is looking at a practically impossible situation and making it happen just miraculously quickly
9298097 were trying to bring circus animals and have a carnival
9298098 i thing its very nice that someone wants to do this for us
9298099 i had no idea i would be doing this four months ago
9298100 having this project has been the perfect opportunity to gain the skills that i needed
9298101 i want to give back to people and this is a perfect opportunity
9298102 detailed studies of human remains from palau suggest that over the past 3 000 years these individuals were all normal sized and what you would expect to see in a micronesian population
9298103 as both we and fitzpatrick point out islands in the pacific have commonly produced very small bodied populations by global population standards
9298104 i can certainly see that it has similarities with the pool stone however it reminds me of another similar stone from eday discovered in the 1980s the stone also seems to display proto double spirals as on some of the pierowall stones its a beautiful find
9298105 celebrities dont have to worry about family budgets but we sure do
9298106 were paying more for food and gas making it harder to save for college retirement
9298107 obamas solution higher taxes called a recipe for economic disaster hes ready to raise your taxes but not ready to lead
9298108 for centuries people have been coming to the ness and because it is dominated by the two massive stone rings its come to be assumed that they were the main neolithic focus of the area the ring of brodgar in particular has become regarded as the ceremonial centre of the ness in light of this summers finds however i would question that interpretation i wonder whether the stone circles were merely on the periphery of the true ceremonial centre a massive ceremonial complex fragments of which are now only coming to light its becoming clear to us now that this complex in its heyday must have completely dominated the landscape
9298109 earlier this month when colin richards was excavating at the ring of brodgar he suggested the ring might have been built around an existing pathway along the ness the same could be true with the standing stones of stenness at the other end colin suggested that the rings marked stages in a journey across the ness a journey which had a distinct end point he wondered whether this end point was the big mound by lochview but i think maybe the focus was just this whole complex a ceremonial centre comprised of several huge imposing structures all together the sheer scale of these structures suggests it was more than a mere settlement if that was the case were the ring or brodgar and standing stones of stenness a ritual or ceremonial portal into the ness complex something you had to pass through en route to the complex and not necessarily as has been long believed the end points or sole purpose of the journey
9298110 there is something strange about this site when you think about it being enclosed by the monumental great wall of brodgar and its position in the centre of the two stone circles you really have to wonder about its overall significance
9298111 dont you think it was odd that both of you could see amp hear me moving in the bushes amp trees but the soldiers did not
9298112 yes that is odd but that does not prove that you are our father then we asked how was it possible that he was our father since we both already had fathers were they our fake fathers

9298115 the center of hurricane gustav was located near latitude 23 1 north longitude 83 8 west or over the southeastern gulf of mexico about 90 miles west of havana cuba and about 530 miles southeast of the mouth of the mississippi river
9298116 gustav is moving toward the northwest near 15 mph and this motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days on this track the center of gustav is forecast to move into the central gulf of mexico on sunday and then make landfall on the northern gulf coast on monday
9298117 this is the mother of all storms and im not sure weve seen anything like it
9298118 this is the real deal this is not a test for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9298119 new orleans will be impacted but to what degree we dont know
9298120 potential for a significant storm surge we dont know how much or where
9298121 its just like rita its more of a rural storm than an urban storm
9298122 the system itself is stronger than it was before katrina
9298123 today chairman of the house judiciary committee john conyers jr d mi sent a letter to white house counsel fred fielding setting a september 4 2008 deadline for the white house to comply with its obligations regarding production of documents under the july 31 order issued by u s district judge john bates in committee on the judiciary v miers
9298124 the letter also notes that a hearing at which harriet miers is to appear pursuant to subpoena has been rescheduled for september 11 2008
9298125 this is the first time hp is working with amd in such a meaningful programme
9298126 hp has always been committed to contributing to the education sector and this is one of several programmes we have in the pipeline
9298127 there are many talented individuals out there seeking higher education to strengthen their knowledge base and enhance skill sets
9298128 we are proud to work with hp to provide the opportunity for students seeking to reach greater heights but lacking the means to do so
9298129 hopefully this programme will alleviate their financial burdens and produce leaders in the respective fields
9298130 if we did not have a system of classification that was hierarchical and had names that could be easily retrieved we would be helpless
9298131 splitters want to draw the lines around a specimen tightly while lumpers will say no thats just a slight variation and there is nothing in this system which tells you who is right it is purely subjective
9298132 if you want to preserve a vanishing species or combat a medically dangerous one or use it in some beneficial way as a crop you need to know what you are dealing with
9298133 that name is the key to all the knowledge that has been accumulated about that organism
9298134 two hundred and fifty years after linnaeus we have still only classified as few as 10 percent of the organisms living on earth
9298135 in dealing with the living world we are mostly flying blind
9298136 trying to diagnose the health of an ecosystem a lake or a forest to save or stabilise it is like a doctor treating a patient while only knowing ten percent of the organs
9298137 the registry will be the central place where everyone can go look to see what is going on in the rest of the world
9298138 you are right i cant know 100 as a matter of fact i contemplated
9298139 whatever is thought if it was worth thinking must be written down at once
9298140 there has been a significant increase in the number of refusals about 40 percent between june 2006 and june 2008 since june 2006 there have been 10 increases in interest rates by 500 basis points resulting in mortgage repayments increasing by 43 percent
9298141 consumers disposable income has deteriorated significantly over the two year period which has resulted in an increase in the number of mortgage refusals this is attributed to the significant increase in interest rates together with the rising food and fuel prices
9298142 given this banks have had to adopt a more prudent approach to lending
9298143 we will begin to see more activity in the local residential market and some reprieve for many customers
9298144 however the 2010 soccer world cup could offset the current negative view of south africa as an investment destination and this could drive momentum in the residential property market
9298145 we have always made this point that testing is a word that we find difficult to adjust with so we will find ways around it
9298146 definitely we dont want ourselves to be singled out for this if any country does not wish to give us enrichment and reprocessing technologies and still wishes to have nuclear commerce well draw up our guidelines according to that what we dont want is each countrys individual predilections forming a huge package of items in the nsg exemptions
9298147 if the chairman is making a statement which reflects to some extent some of the concerns of nsg states may be but as long as it does not inhibit us from what we believe is a clean and unconditional exemption
9298148 in short the film links the two burial chambers barclodiad y gawres and bryn celli ddu with an earth goddess rising from the carved stone in barclodiad y gawres and creating a strange potion which explodes causing the isle of anglesey to be formed in the steaming embers of the fire visitors will have to come along and see the film to see what happens in the end
9298149 how do you know that you dont have a steroid problem
9298150 the only way you know is if you have a testing program
9298151 its extremely naive to think that this stuff is not going on in this school or in that school it borders on irresponsible for coaches to lead the general population to believe that they dont have a problem in their school because they have no way of knowing that they have a problem in their school if theyre not testing
9298152 if there are only two positive tests it means theres either a problem with the testing program or that the program is deterring steroid use
9298153 it will be our alaska gas flowing to provide aid to those in the lower 48 who are turning to alaska waiting and wanting alaska to help

9298182 i have often asked myself why why me why my daughter
9298183 when you go out you go with fear are you going to make it home or not

9298205 i will not bow i will not step down and i will not resign despite the pressure mounting on my government
9298206 since the government cannot resolve the problem the joint session of parliament is the best choice for finding a solution
9298207 its very big and weve got to get ready for whats coming

9298213 our serious concerns about these charges have been greatly elevated by the recently published article
9298214 we have grave concerns that this type of betrayal of public trust and malfeasance may be happening in our local union
9298215 they are just unhappy with him because he is in charge

9298217 its another attempt by the ethics commission to make it undesirable to be a lobbyist and it has no public policy benefit
9298218 i refuse to wear the equivalent of a yellow arm band
9298219 in fact we were hoping it could be viewed as something positive where people could get familiar with who these people are
9298220 theyre on salary so a one contact rule would basically mean that if you have one contact youre basically a lobbyist

9298224 were able to work with people who once were enemies and people who you would never think you would get along with
9298225 this is a chance to give back to the community to go home and feel that you made it possible for a family to live and grow and be happy

9298232 he talked to the pilots and really told them how proud he was of them what they were doing for their country
9298233 heres a guy who just spent 5 1 2 years in the prison and hes trying to give a shot in the arm to the pilots who were ready to go
9298234 he was highly motivated and he had a real sense of direction it was a determination to spend the rest of his life like his father and grandfather had committed to the country and making it a better place
9298235 the state of military readiness in the united states was very low and my squadrons readiness was no exception
9298236 everything was really quite a mess and things changed very quickly and very positively
9298237 hes got a charisma about him that i dont know he makes you stand a little taller and move a little faster its like a fever
9298238 but i dont take umbrage at it because politicians have to make political statements
9298239 the accomplishment was shared by everyone whereas failure would have landed just on mccain
9298240 i was trying to get out the door afraid these gents were going to have heart attacks
9298241 stopped that man immediately and he said you are talking to an officer in the united states navy and i do not care what your disagreement with lieutenant j
9298242 many of us didnt like it and the more ive grown ive had to step back and say well it was there it was inappropriate
9298243 i was at a party and his mother came up and said john really wants that job
9298244 and he said yeah i think my dad has always kind of hoped that i would
9298245 it was in many ways if not a turning point certainly an affirmation that i had learned the lessons of life and leadership and duty and honor and country and was able to put into practice all the things i had learned and believed in and learned from my father and grandfather
9298246 so many mysterious women in black moved in and out of the mausoleum in hollywood cemetery yesterday that it took on the appearance of the salesgirls entrance to a large department store
9298247 raising taxes at this point will definitely damage and hinder the economy and make it even more difficult to rebound form this downturn
9298248 we were sent to sacramento to solve problems once and for all not kick the can down the alley for others to deal with in the future
9298249 it is my belief and i have some evidence that instead of writing people up and being very succinct that people have made deals
9298250 she visited classrooms she made sure teachers followed the lesson plan she made a real difference
9298251 they wanted me to jump on her but it turns out when you leave her alone shes quite effective
9298252 anyone who can pass maths in the pass leaving cert should be able to do it
9298253 the galway races had just one helicopter less registered compared with last year there were about 87 as against 86 a year earlier
9298254 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9298255 theres no reason for anyone to stay in new orleans to ride out this storm we cant stop the damage from happening what we can do is move people out of harms way
9298256 he told each of the governors that federal officials were monitoring hurricane gustav very closely
9298257 president bush pledged the full support of the federal government
9298258 were facing what could be a very strong hurricane possibly one of the largest and strongest to hit america since records began
9298259 one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9298260 we were told he only does two speaking events a year and that the wait time was up to 18 months
9298261 in the civil war game he responded and in the bowl game he was outstanding
9298262 we felt we had two very very good quarterbacks and it was a close race for the starting job justin roper is a great quarterback hes proved that he actually most likely out performed nate in the scrimmage we had two weeks ago so im very excited about that
9298263 i really think he will push justin roper and that will be a new battle between those two
9298264 jeremiah i think will probably play this week well try to find some areas to get him in the game
9298265 hes an exceptional passer has the quickest release and a very strong arm
9298266 whether he plays or not right now i dont know im not sure well see how the game goes
9298267 we may want to get him into the football game
9298268 those guys are all very good workers good leaders and they care about their teammates
9298269 do innovations really pay off total stock market returns to innovation
9298270 markets respond promptly and substantially to announcements about innovation at all stages of the innovation project
9298271 i think what he learned from the 2000 primary was to fight back and not take anything for granted
9298272 thats why when obama said that john would use that obama doesnt look like the other presidents on dollar bills and that he had a funny last name that john didnt let that go unaddressed
9298273 i find myself surprised by some of the tactics that ive seen in the last few weeks
9298274 they dont seem like the tactics of the john mccain i know
9298275 i will not take the low road to the highest office in the land
9298276 i want the presidency in the best way not the worst way
9298277 i think a lot of his actions in 2001 to 2003 when he was actively opposing the president were rooted in south carolina
9298278 he shoved campaign finance down the presidents throat and he opposed the tax cuts
9298279 they needed each other bush needed mccain and his great appeal among moderate voters and mccain needed to show conservatives that he was doing everything to get bush re elected
9298280 gustav is forecast to remain a major hurricane through landfall along the northern gulf coast
9298281 really i just did not expect this it has been a long time since we have been hit by such a powerful hurricane and this gustav looks like it will be quite strong
9298282 because while there are many pauls eager to have a hand in robbing peter so long as theres a payoff in it and many eager do gooders fresh off a dorm room etc nanny state etc
9298283 it aint braggin if you do it and you back it up
9298284 sign on young man and sail with me the stature of our homeland is no more than the measure of ourselves our job is to keep her free our will is to keep the torch of freedom burning for all to this solemn purpose we call on the young the brave the strong and the free heed my call come to the sea come sail with me
9298285 pardon him theodotus he is a barbarian and thinks that the customs of his tribe and island are the laws of nature
9298286 and those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music
9298287 a kind providence has placed in our breasts a hatred of the unjust and cruel in order that we may preserve ourselves from cruelty and injustice
9298288 is this what you really want is this what you were born to do if there was only one thing you could do with the rest of your life what would it be
9298289 for years al qaida and other terror groups have set up shop in the internet those who track them have covertly followed the companies intelcenter have penetrated even deeper into the terror web than most intelligence agencies
9298290 the world bank said improved economic estimates showed there were more poor people around the world than previously thought while also revealing big successes in the fight to overcome extreme poverty
9298291 we continue to closely monitor the movement of the storm and are considering necessary contingencies
9298292 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9298293 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9298294 intent on committing criminal acts before and during the republican national convention
9298295 its the same charge used against the chicago eight in 1968 and that was purely a politically motivated prosecution
9298296 this isnt about protecting delegates this is about a preemptive strike
9298297 she took on the republican sellouts who just want to hold onto power
9298298 this is exactly the message of change that was needed
9298299 she has been there and made the choice she made the choice for life
9298300 she was faced with a decision of having an abortion and she decided she was going to be there for him it shows a lot about her character
9298301 it is a combination of enthusiasm for john mccain and the prospect of an obama administration that is to say the least sobering
9298302 she is a very gutsy young woman willing to take on special interests and corruption even when it was in her own party
9298303 if they want to put a spotlight on sarah palins experience it will turn into a mirror for obama
9298304 the rain was great but we still have a long way to go before we catch up
9298305 the deficits are so great not even a big soaker like this storm can erase them
9298306 this is a historic drought the likes of which weve never seen before
9298307 its kind of strange the way that little pocket has held out and missed out on those storm systems
9298308 big cities like atlanta and raleigh have been ok with water this summer so we havent gotten the national attention we did last summer
9298309 im ok youre not the message were sending nonbelievers and why we should stop
9298310 poor at expressing emotions or at reading the nuances of emotions in other people

9298318 how are all those republicans actually going to help people if there are no professionals there to organize them
9298319 he is going to get further tests soon but that is a possibility
9298320 being thats a similar feel and in the same spot its a possibility yes
9298321 the politicos sock puppet argument is driven more by rank sexism
9298322 sarah palins selection unleashes gender as a live issue again just when democrats thought they had it under control
9298323 how much of our life that we share with the web 2 0 giants do we really need to share how much of these services can and should we be running from the comfort of our own homes

9298328 as far as sources for audio options i shop at b amp h
9298329 i dont know what it is but it is really really cool
9298330 i have things that will bloom 11 weeks in my garden much longer in other peoples
9298331 the reason im doing this successfully is i have a terrible garden most people fertilize and weed and water thats the wrong thing to do if youre a plant breeder if youre a plant breeder the key is selection i have to give it conditions that deter and it reblooms anyway
9298332 huge sexual parts even a blind person could deal with
9298333 there are very few people in this area who are hybridizing to start early and go all season around here that would be mike
9298334 a lot of people are a little tired of it
9298335 at last a northern rebloomer that isnt yellow or gold
9298336 at last stella de oros rebloom is available in a near white
9298337 hes not known for super fancy daylilies hes interested in plants that rebloom the ones that rebloom are not as fancy but theyre great garden plants
9298338 his early and often blooms from early june to frost stella de oro actually stops for a few periods and rests early and often does not take any breaks its one of the backbones of his hybridizing
9298339 maybe i get something thats better looking than the parents
9298340 each generation takes two years to bloom and i may not know if i want to use it until the third year its a long cycle
9298341 a lot of breeders wont make a cross unless they envision an immediate result
9298342 when i grow 1 000 seedlings maybe ill keep 20
9298343 i rule out a lot of things because they have too few buds or they dont rebloom plants that are weak growers dont perform and dont get a second look
9298344 i find it important to switch between hobbies so i dont get bored

9298347 these subjects are part of a longer and mid term discussion
9298348 a similar cold front caused a major dust event on monday the rest of the event has been relatively dust free
9298349 overall the event is going smoothly with no major problems
9298350 medical cases are very consistent with last year with daily patient loads of 0 5 to 0 7 percent of the population
9298351 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9298352 i got caught in the water and spent two days on my roof no food no water it was pretty bad
9298353 people are afraid of coming back after the storm they want some protection when they walk back in
9298354 ill never leave again just being away worrying about it last time id have rather been here

9298356 israels war with iran and the zionist power configuration in america
9298357 empire or republic global power or domestic decay in the united states
9298358 the us commitment to maintaining israels qualitative military edge is the cornerstone of american sic zpc policy in the region this years package holds heightened significance as the us and israel face new challenged from irans drive to acquire sic nuclear weapons
9298359 american companies are prohibited from any involvement in irans energy sector those non us international groups that have invested in iran are for now going slow they are trying to avoid pressing ahead with investments that would anger washington while also trying to avoid pulling out which could annoy tehran
9298360 in 2004 aipac and its affiliated think tank the washington institute for near east policy winep lobbied for a new separate us treasury unit to be created the office of terrorism and financial intelligence otfi it is headed by aipac vetted leadership and many otfi briefings are delivered directly to winep oftis secretive financial operations that target iran and its trading partners are tightly coordinated with israels leadership
9298361 we have to consider the sources of support the corporate sector in the us which dominates policy formation appears to be quite satisfied with the current situation one indication is the increasing flow of investment to israel by intel hewlett packard microsoft and other leading elements of the high tech economy military and intelligence relations remain very strong since 1967 us intellectuals have had a virtual love affair with israel for reasons that relate more to the us than to israel in my opinion that strongly affects portrayal of events and history in media and journals
9298362 we must understand that technologies like these are the way of the future
9298363 the landscape up here is littered with people who have underestimated her
9298364 maybe she is not ready for prime time or maybe she is going to litter the national landscape with people who have underestimated her
9298365 the previous governor had like a 20 approval rating they were tired of this just relentless brute ignoring the public mentality then the fbi raids all she had to do was show up and she got elected
9298366 theres always been a little bit of an air of an opportunist about the governor
9298367 it would be incorrect to say the bill came from the governor
9298368 theres a real question whether shes a republican or a democrat
9298369 she has succeeded in her own limited policy agenda as a republican governor by having the democrat caucus in lock step with her
9298370 her administration had the appearance of paying absolutely no attention to any of the rest of the unglamorous side of government
9298371 whether it be dealing with human services public services highways all the routine aspects
9298372 they said we took their jobs but i was working from 6 a m to 8 p m
9298373 they need to go and do this in every little town
9298374 and it seems like they have just arrived and are getting the nice cars and the good homes
9298375 placed all the burdens of a broken system onto immigrant families
9298376 the democrats are on our side in our battle against america
9298377 a lot of people may choose that they dont want to take a risk they know how quickly weather can change and that may discourage a lot of travelers from traveling any distance this weekend
9298378 we want to get home before the contra flow starts
9298379 a lot of cancellations were going on but its now picking up
9298380 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up
9298381 it can take several days for the subsea wells typically about half of our production comes back rather quickly
9298382 but were also working with local authorities to provide fuel along evacuation routes
9298383 appropriate planning is under way to allow for the safe shut down of refinery operations and the evacuation of refinery personnel as circumstances warrant
9298384 if its like katrina they might not let us back
9298385 they might put a fence around the whole parish and say go away
9298386 i mean my house is not even finished and then what its going to float away again
9298387 i was hoping to get all the way right at least before another hurricane came and ate up my world
9298388 if i would have been in my house for a day it would have been ok then i could have dealt with it
9298389 i dont have a car i had to come with my neighbors
9298390 but i wasnt going to wait not after katrina these things can be killers we know it now youd have to be a fool not to get out while the gettings good
9298391 i was here three days in this house after katrina the water was over my head i floated out on an ice chest to get away
9298392 im not goin they arent gonna scare me or run me out im tired im too tired to go through it all again
9298393 we watched katrina from the cockpit of a 19 foot sailboat
9298394 thats what we do we rebuild thats the nature of mankind
9298395 katrina was hell there is a reason to have anxiety
9298396 weve paid our dues as far as im concerned i know its selfish but thats the way it is
9298397 ruby red platform heels with a pink french style pedicure
9298398 the truth is no one knows whether sarah palin could be a competent president which shows how highly political and potentially reckless this choice is
9298399 shes got a great story she seems to have a wonderful engaging personality and the fact that she got elected governor of alaska i think shows shes got real political skills
9298400 i think that ultimately she subscribes to the same economic theories and foreign policy theories as john mccain does i think those are the wrong theories for this country i dont think that john mccain is offering something that can help middle class families on paying the bills sending their kids to college and getting healthcare and i dont get the sense that the addition of the vice presidential choice is going to change that
9298401 obviously this is a very serious situation it is a potentially very powerful storm
9298402 the president is highly unpopular there doesnt seem to be much excitement around the candidate and theres a real fear of being tagged with the republican label and being seen with george bush
9298403 if the convention wasnt in st paul i wouldnt be at the convention
9298404 at approximately 11 00 a m thursday august 28 2008 john mccain formally invited governor sarah palin to join the republican ticket as the vice presidential nominee on the deck of the mccain family home
9298405 at a time when americans want change in washington sara sic palin is a fresh and energetic voice joining the debate i am thrilled with sen mccains choice and i look forward to having this strong and independent woman who brings a lot of substance to the campaign
9298406 it is interesting to hear all of these liberals whine about foreign policy experience where were they when the democrats were nominating bill clinton a governor of arkansas to be president how about jimmy carter a peanut farmer from rural georgia
9298407 this move the day after obamas greek temple speech has sucked the air out of obamas 15 minutes of fame i predict that obama will end up back in the senate humiliated by a devastating defeat
9298408 the vice president is a heartbeat away from becoming president so to choose someone with not one hours worth of experience on national issues is a dangerous choice
9298409 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken
9298410 the only similarity between her and hillary clinton is that they are both women on the issues they could not be further apart
9298411 palin has more experience than obama biden and mccain all three
9298412 i just want you to know that your husband is seeing my wife
9298413 if you love her and you want to make this work then you need to go home and be with her
9298414 she said that she yelled something like terry wait and this was at about the same time as she pushed on the door to try to get into the bathroom and at the same time she heard a shot
9298415 i fell in love with cheryl the first time we met
9298416 i let someone come between you i which should have never happened
9298417 i look back on everything see where i gave up love companion ship for attention affection it would be wonderful if i could turn back our lives for the past four years
9298418 if you live gods will and give with a happy heart you will reap the rewards
9298419 do you remember where you were 13 years ago on this day
9298420 he just wasnt the happy go lucky guy id known all my life
9298421 to keep cheryl in the style she wants to live
9298422 i always thought my uncle was in pretty good financial standing
9298423 it was just a shock to me that his finances were in that bad condition
9298424 one day she hates you and one day she loves you and the next day she hates you
9298425 we cannot let the situation in the country go on like this
9298426 it must be over but i will not do anything that will create a bad atmosphere the announcement of an emergency decree would create a bad atmosphere in the country and to the world
9298427 what they are trying to do now is overthrow the government
9298428 they seized airports is this democracy or is this the peoples alliance to destroy democracy
9298429 we are worried that the pad will come here so we are here to protect the people
9298430 i told you before that i will not resign i will stay on to run this country
9298431 deforestation has to fall more and the conditions for sustainable development have to improve
9298432 im offended by barack obama saying that about my husband
9298433 my father had nothing he and my mother sold everything they had to raise 10 000
9298434 im proud of what my dad and my mother did and what they built and left me and i intend to carry their legacy as long as i can

9298447 open standards and in particular semantic web standards can help lower the cost of government make it easier for independent agencies to work together and increase flexibility in the face of change
9298448 we need to solve important challenges such as lack of standards in end user devices network constraints service cost issues of literacy and an understanding of the real information needs of rural communities
9298449 to do so requires an multidisciplinary approach a step we take through the creation of this new group
9298450 b enefits to end user interaction of adopting such common infrastructure will include richer user interaction enabled through simplified approaches to mixing multiple interaction technologies in a single application the ability to easily share data across multiple components and to freely intermix ajax and declarative components should support a wider range of high function composable uis
9298451 i am glad to see that the community of developers including browser vendors is working together to create the best possible path for the web
9298452 trying to use the semantic web without sparql is like trying to use a relational database without sql
9298453 ads shouldnt be placed under a title or section heading in a way that implies that the ads are not ads
9298454 publishers may not label the google ads with text other than sponsored links or advertisements
9298455 the adsense code what google never told you about making money with adsense
9298456 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9298457 and it is warm not something im really used to
9298458 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9298459 can be a distraction in these kinds of situations so we want to make sure that were monitoring the situation and that were being useful
9298460 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me
9298461 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9298462 can step in and become president and i dont think anybody has any doubt about that
9298463 counsel and advice of somebody whos not going to agree with me 100 percent of the time
9298464 but for the rest of us theres still no change
9298465 we plan to start when were going to start and end when were going to end
9298466 right now it appears to have restored a leaner version
9298467 im not sure when well have it back up the way it was
9298468 basically any industry where youve got workers out in the middle of nowhere
9298469 if you see a fire and have no connectivity you cant tell anybody
9298470 to have a satellite phone with you you can make that immediate call and get firefighters mobilized
9298471 qu bueno que haya un blog de esta tem tica en espa ol
9298472 blogs que me dan curiosidad por las dudas lo agrego
9298473 literally like if the redskins had just won the super bowl
9298474 people were high fiving giving each other hugs smiling from ear to ear it was euphoria
9298475 ive been arguing for a long time that john mccain would have to pick someone who would not just satisfy conservatives but send them running back to him
9298476 and with this selection john mccain hit it out of the park
9298477 even those of us who supported other candidates are four square behind john mccain
9298478 when i saw the e mail confirming palins selection i was like wow weve really got a complete ticket the democratic ticket is all about making history but our ticket is about leadership experience and making history so we sort of kill two birds with one stone
9298479 a lot of those 18 million clinton voters feel disenfranchised and betrayed
9298480 i remember him talking about her when he came back
9298481 he said she was an impressive woman he liked her
9298482 he was down to the point that if the meeting had gone well and it was expected to go well there was going to be an offer
9298483 i dont think he would have invited her if it werent his intention to offer her the job
9298484 nobody was vetted less or more than anyone in the final stages and john had access to all that information and made the decision
9298485 to finish one of these races as a team and still be friends is incredible
9298486 very few can do that its just too much an individual mentality and very few teams ever come back together a second time
9298487 that was quite a poor performance by all three of you chaps
9298488 if you really have to ask youre never gonna get it
9298489 no way in hell im going to get up at 5 a m to go running
9298490 but if he didnt race i think hed go crazy frank doesnt do anything a little bit
9298491 i dont like thinking that theres a race out there i dont know if i can do
9298492 wootens words were i will kill him hell eat a expletive lead bullet ill shoot him if our father got the attorney to help molly
9298493 i heard this death threat my 16 year old son heard it track palin molly heard it as did their small children wooten spoke with his trooper gun on his hip in an extremely intimidating fashion leaving no doubt he is serious about taking someones life who disagrees with him
9298494 my concern is that the publics faith in the troopers will continue to diminish as more residents express concerns regarding the apparent lack of action towards a trooper whom is described by many as a ticking time bomb and a loose cannon
9298495 wooten is my brother in law but this information is forwarded to you objectively
9298496 you gotta make as much money as you can because when we shut down and were gonna shut down thats it for a long while
9298497 most people dont have cars to leave dont have money for gas pay for a hotel for that long i mean you have to do whatever you have to do and i guess im gonna stay and work
9298498 i really dont have anywhere to go if i could leave i could go home but that doesnt seem like the thing to try too far i guess
9298499 our boss was into playing his trumpet down here more than he was into running a business so that all kinda went to hell and now im working here
9298500 ive never been through one and im not sure what to believe you see the national weather people and theyre telling you its gonna be really bad
9298501 i dont leave for nothing i didnt even leave for katrina
9298502 i mean look at the local weather guys they know what theyre doing not those weather channel people the local people say its gonna move north and thats enough for me
9298503 lot of folks around here are gonna make do with what they have and you wont hear a terrible amount of complaining
9298504 you cant just come in here and expect to hear people fussing about how they dont have nothing people just be used to not having much and so you dont even think too hard about it until someone starts asking you questions
9298505 now what do you think that would look like me and my little car sitting there in traffic with two big old rottweilers
9298506 guess im just gonna wait i just dont know its all stressful
9298507 its hard to explain to someone whos not from here why anyone would choose to stay
9298508 as long as i have power im good probably wont have power for long but this place is pretty tough
9298509 when you stand out there by that river and look at that levee
9298510 you are just so blessed to live here i am in love and so i make my choice
9298511 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a
9298512 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9298513 you see wire telegraph is a kind of a very very long cat you pull his tail in new york and his head is meowing in los angeles do you understand this and radio operates exactly the same way you send signals here they receive them there the only difference is that there is no cat
9298514 it would appear that bryans may be taking part in unofficial discussions
9298515 bryans idea is that the world ought to be divided into two parts that germany should be given a free hand in europe and that the british empire should run the rest of the world
9298516 i am not sure that this is a very desirable point of view to publish at the present time
9298517 bryans is a talkative and indiscreet fellow who is in possession of a story which he delights in telling and which if told publicly would be likely to cause embarrassment to the foreign office
9298518 although there seems to be a good deal to be said for locking him up to prevent him airing his views to all and sundry i understand that if this is done it will inevitably involve his bringing up the question of his contacts with the foreign office and the facilities afforded him to go to italy
9298519 it occurs to me that this is a possible means of putting deception over to the enemy by the careful framing of the questionnaires as presumably the germans must if they capture some of these birds take notice of the type of question which is being asked
9298520 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9298521 and it is warm not something im really used to
9298522 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9298523 can be a distraction in these kinds of situations so we want to make sure that were monitoring the situation and that were being useful
9298524 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me
9298525 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9298526 can step in and become president and i dont think anybody has any doubt about that
9298527 counsel and advice of somebody whos not going to agree with me 100 percent of the time
9298528 but for the rest of us theres still no change
9298529 we plan to start when were going to start and end when were going to end
9298530 right now it appears to have restored a leaner version
9298531 im not sure when well have it back up the way it was
9298532 i need beaver pennsylvania i need you to stand up beside me and say now is the time to bring about change in america
9298533 is it a hurricane is it the convention or is it a blend of the two
9298534 expect to be on the first plane to the hurricane
9298535 like any good journalist theyre all eager to go down there
9298536 the approach of gustav and the is the confluence of two major news events for us and other news organizations
9298537 and of course the first the storm has the potential to be a major political event as well thus influencing the second the convention
9298538 we have a bunch of really talented journalists who can turn on a dime
9298539 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9298540 they have closed everything hotels restaurants bars museums theres not much to do but wait
9298541 ive had enough kidnapping corrupt police a rotten judicial system
9298542 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive maybe nothing like this has happened to them or they would be more sensitive
9298543 the most frustrating thing has been the indolence of many of the authorities their insensitivity
9298544 i have often asked myself why why me why my daughter
9298545 when you go out you go with fear are you going to make it home or not
9298546 we have a great track record of bringing substance with splash
9298547 you expect people to respond by organizing a protest and throwing their fists in the air and you also expect people to respond by flying 1 000 american flags
9298548 and those are two legitimate ways to respond to politics but there is a whole in between area that doesnt get talked about
9298549 help me shake up washington and make it start working again for the people
9298550 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9298551 as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need
9298552 america knows this is john mccains agenda and we cant afford four more years of the same
9298553 there would be no more powerful way of making them feel part of the olympics would there
9298554 i will not bow i will not step down and i will not resign despite the pressure mounting on my government
9298555 since the government cannot resolve the problem the joint session of parliament is the best choice for finding a solution
9298556 this accord opens the door to the future cooperation and partnership between italy and libya
9298557 it is a complete and moral acknowledgement of the damage inflicted on libya by italy during the colonial era
9298558 in this historic document italy apologizes for its killing destruction and repression against libyans during the colonial rule
9298559 were facing what could be a very strong hurricane possibly one of the largest and strongest to hit america since records began
9298560 we have gone from a reactive organization to a proactive organization
9298561 theres no reason for anyone to stay in new orleans to ride out this storm
9298562 we cant stop the damage from happening what we can do is move people out of harms way
9298563 we advise you to exercise caution and monitor developments that might affect your safety in the united states because of the risk of terrorism
9298564 it is at yellow or elevated for all other sectors indicating a significant risk of terrorist attack
9298565 australians in affected regions should adhere to all advice and evacuation requests enforced by
9298566 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century
9298567 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day
9298568 we could see flooding even worse than we saw in hurricane katrina
9298569 i wouldnt worry about whether the evacuation in your parish begins at 4 p m today or 8 a m tomorrow
9298570 when it comes to evacuation do it sooner rather than later
9298571 my last 24 hours have been somewhat worrisome and very very prayerful because this is a very serious threat and its a lot of people to get to safe ground or be safe where they are
9298572 this is very very serious and we need you to heed this warning
9298573 we really dont have the resources to rescue you after this
9298574 i wouldnt call it a nightmare but it is a very perplexing challenge
9298575 he wants to do something service oriented if and when the storm hits and its as bad as its expected to be now
9298576 if they say we cant guarantee your safety you dont go
9298577 these subjects are part of a longer and mid term discussion
9298578 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country then recognizing part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy
9298579 without urgent action we risk sleepwalking into an energy dependance on less stable or reliable partners
9298580 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9298581 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9298582 but an informal request as an agency we realize we want to be prepared and look at our options across the program

9298588 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9298589 i got caught in the water and spent two days on my roof no food no water it was pretty bad
9298590 people are afraid of coming back after the storm they want some protection when they walk back in
9298591 ill never leave again just being away worrying about it last time id have rather been here
9298592 the very same people who only yesterday insisted that obamas resume was too dangerously thin to entrust him with the oversight of our national security today are celebrating palins accession as a triumph for conservatism evidently this is because she is hostile to both abortion and polar bears their hypocrisy is staggering they truly do believe in nothing but their own entitlement to power by any means and im very much afraid i must conclude this is as true of mccain as it is of his ghastly cheerleaders the limbaughs and the hannitys nothing else could explain the elevation of a woman so singularly unqualified in every aspect save gender
9298593 in case you thought i never posted photos of myself

9298604 state senate president lyda green said she thought it was a joke when someone called her at 6 a m to give her the news
9298605 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9298606 come on if the sun affected the earth temperature it would be hotter in the day time than at night oh wait
9298607 i went in there and saw him at halftime and said i dont know for sure jeff but the best part of this if you cant play the rest of the year we get to hang around each other for another year
9298608 its a big loss as a team well just have to keep him uplifted
9298609 it was really tough not having him in there beside me at times
9298610 it sucks but hes got to get over it and well see him next year
9298611 bottom line somebodys going to have to take up the slack up front
9298612 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9298613 senator john mccain spent the summer arguing that a 40 something candidate with four years in major office and no significant foreign policy experience was not ready to be president and then on friday he picked as his running mate a 40 something candidate with two years in major office and no significant foreign policy experience
9298614 alaska now has some of the highest resource taxes in the world
9298615 bp alaska which runs prudhoe bay said earlier this year that it had delayed the development in the western region of the north slope as a result of the tax
9298616 conocophillips cited the same reason for scrapping a 300 million refinery project
9298617 when obama talks you can almost see the wheels turning as he does an instant replay of what he just said he doesnt seem convinced of his platform so how can the electorate be
9298618 the more i learn about sarah palin the more i like her
9298619 thats the whole trouble you cant ever find a place thats nice and peaceful because there isnt any you may think there is but once you get there when youre not looking somebodyll sneak up and write fuck you right under your nose try it sometime i think even if i ever die and they stick me in a cemetary and i have a tombstone and all itll say holden caulfield on it and then what year i was born and what year i died and then right under that itll say fuck you im positive in fact

9298621 ulan bator 1913 as a nomadic culture the mongolians of the steppes needed to find ways of punishing those who transgressed their laws without compromising their mobility this woman is thought to have committed adultery
9298622 one of the most disturbing images is this poor woman in a box it was quite a common punishment at the time in mongolia people would be put into a box and left they would be dependent on others to be fed you can see that she cant quite the bowl thats placed nearby shes seeming to be desperately trying to fiddle with the locks but clearly theres no chance of her being able to get out now pathe has remarked that this is a punishment for a woman who had committed adultery but that seems rather peculiar the mongols werent particularly prudish so i think its more likely she was in the box for something else
9298623 i am waiting to receive a uk visa and then ill fly to london to sign a contract everything went really fast

9298632 i was enjoying some turkey chili with david broder yesterday
9298633 i dare not spoil my good memories of the original
9298634 what is happening in minneapolis is reflecting a larger trend in the country in general we heard today homeland security mentioned and there seems to be a trend of whats been happening lately
9298635 security and safety are being used to tip the scales away from freedom of information and right to assemble and freedom of press we are not fighting perhaps as hard as we should be and working to preserve those rights that are so valuable and are also valuable to our safety and security
9298636 was there similar infiltration and mass arrest of groups prior to the democratic convention please dont treat that as flamebait im genuinely curious
9298637 but it wasnt a false arrest look how many of them confessed to crimes
9298638 that sounds an awful lot like a riot to me
9298639 were all a bunch of groups with different aims so lets just all do what we want and not jump up each others butts about it
9298640 thats what represents most of the illegal activity we hear about buckets of urine not withstanding although ill believe that when i see it
9298641 but it wasnt a false arrest look how many of them confessed to crimes
9298642 really officer im not even strong enough to throw this whole pallet of bricks through a window
9298643 things arent great they arent even the way they should be
9298644 the link death has an image of extremely malnourished people
9298645 ultimately millions of bengalis died because their british rulers didnt give a damn and had other strategic imperatives the bengal famine and its aftermath for the debilitated bengal population consumed its victims over several years in the case of complete british inaction through most of 1943 or insufficient subsequent action churchill had a confessed hatred for indians and during the famine he opposed the humanitarian attempts of people such as the prime minister of canada louis mountbatten viceroy general wavell and even of japanese collaborationist leader subhash chandra bose the hypothesis can be legitimately advanced that the extent of the bengal famine derived in part from sustained deliberate policy
9298646 food aid has now in addition become a commercial enterprise famine or no famine the shylocks of the grain trade must have their pound of flesh

9298649 elected governor in 2006 palin became alaskas first female governor as well as its youngest she will be the first politician from alaska to run on a national ticket in a campaign for vice president
9298650 palin has made efforts to expand the use of technology in alaska in 2007 palin announced a new online training program for workforce development the work ready college ready program helped to assess skills and offered training courses
9298651 the skills needed to enter many vocations are similar to the skills needed to get into college explained palin at the time
9298652 mead treadwell a technology focused venture capitalist and chair of the u s arctic research commission a federal advisory commission to president bush and congress on arctic research issues said he met palin when she was the mayor of wasilla a small town in alaska treadwell said that she has long been open minded about the need for technology to solve problems
9298653 were a natural energy economy and you cant drill on or offshore without bringing the best technology like 3d seismic technology to find areas for drilling directional drilling to exploit it and satellites shes supportive of new tech treadwell said
9298654 palins father in law was at one time staff officer at the alaska science and technology foundation the states seed capital fund for technology according to treadwell she was critical of her incumbent republican rival frank murkowski in 2006 when he shut the foundation down in her inaugural address as governor she emphasized the value of research into science and technology
9298655 despite alaskas absence of a big tech industry the states chief industries oil and gas as well as some telecommunications require cutting edge technology treadwell said that in discussions with palin about balancing development vs the environment she typically points to technology as a solution
9298656 the blackberry wielding alaska gov sarah palin who had bloggers buzzing early friday about her tech centric lifestyle shes also three years younger than obama
9298657 the technology issue isnt so much of his wired lifestyle as it is about his past stances on technology issues like internet freedom and privacy biden has spoken out against peer to peer networks that allow the sharing of music and other copyrighted material on the topic of internet privacy he is in favor of allowing communications companies to hand over a users personal information to the government but with the intention to crack down on child porn and piracy
9298658 heres i fear the worst harm that may be done by this selection
9298659 teach both you know dont be afraid of education healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class im not going to pretend i know how all this came to be
9298660 mccain wants steve ballmer for his cabinet at least he knows the internet isnt a series of tubes the entire country would become one giant bsod were almost there now
9298661 but question if it were your decision and you were putting your country first would you put an untested small town mayor a heartbeat away from the presidency
9298662 hillary didnt put 18 million cracks in the ceiling so token candidates like sarah palin could make it to the white house what made hillary special was her 35 years of public service intelligence 8 year senate voting record on progressive issues and the fact that shed have one of the greatest presidents at her side should the need arise mrs palin as nice as her life story sounds isnt half the woman hillary clinton proved to be
9298663 72 year old man with a 33 statistical chance of dying in office
9298664 a conservatives view on mccains vp choice david frum national review
9298665 so mccain hammers home his point that a 47 year old one term senator is not ready to lead by choosing a 44 year old less than one term governor as his running mate thats some fine detective work there lou her experience beauty queen gt sportscaster gt mayor of town of 6 500 gt governor of state with population approximately that of the omaha metro area gt one heartbeat away from the presidency nice pick there republicans
9298666 what this story has to do with the world of macintosh is beyond me but ill play mccains choice of running mate is shamefully irresponsible hes an aging old fart who could drop dead at any time and who does he pick to head the government if he should croak but someone with not a shred of experience not a single credential that would qualify her for such an important job totally disgusting
9298667 ive been so focused on state government i havent really focused much on the war in iraq
9298668 i heard on the news about the new deployments and while i support our president condoleezza rice and the administration i want to know that we have an exit plan in place i want assurances that we are doing all we can to keep our troops safe
9298669 im not here to judge the idea of withdrawing or the timeline
9298670 im not going to judge even the surge im here to find out what alaskans need of me as their governor
9298671 i realize of course that shes totally unqualified to be president at this point in time if mccain were to die in february 2009 i hope palin would have the good sense to appoint someone who is more ready to be president to be her vice president on the understanding that she would then resign and be appointed vice president by her successor lest anyone say that this is an absurd unconstitutional or undemocratic scenario recognize that this is pretty much what would happen in a parliamentary system where if the head of government dies a successor is chosen by the party palin is absolutely not ready to be president now but that is a problem that is very easily dealt with if she is and the governing party want to do so
9298672 palin is absolutely not ready to be president now but that is a problem that is very easily dealt with if she is and the governing party want to do so
9298673 the vice president is a heartbeat away from becoming president so to choose someone with not one hours worth of experience on national issues is a dangerous choice
9298674 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken
9298675 the only similarity between her and hillary clinton is that they are both women on the issues they could not be further apart
9298676 sen mccain had so many other options if he wanted to put a woman on his ticket such as sen kay bailey hutchison or sen olympia snowe they would have been an appropriate choice compared to this dangerous choice
9298677 the vice president is a heartbeat away from becoming president so to choose someone with not one hours worth of experience on national issues is a dangerous choice
9298678 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken
9298679 the only similarity between her and hillary clinton is that they are both women on the issues they could not be further apart
9298680 sen mccain had so many other options if he wanted to put a woman on his ticket such as sen kay bailey hutchison or sen olympia snowe they would have been an appropriate choice compared to this dangerous choice

9298689 anyone who decides to stay ill say it like i said it before katrina make sure you have an axe because you will be carving your way or busting your way out of your attic to get on your roof with waters that you will be surrounded with in this event
9298690 youll give me a great excuse to get away and stay away at least until the next morning
9298691 you know how it is right now rosa same old thing
9298692 were you able to catch any of this weeks coverage of the democratic national convention as someone who presents so often it was like getting free sessions in a speaking mastery class delivered direct to my living room
9298693 no i missed it all honestly rosa i am too tired to work on having an informed opinion about it and im just too tired to care not sure ill even bother voting come november
9298694 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century
9298695 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9298696 im afraid chris that we may have to look at that situation and well try and monitor it ive been talking to governors jindal la barbour miss riley ala crist fla ive been talking to all of them
9298697 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9298698 its almost inconceivable that everything that has been done to rebuild that area in the last 3 years
9298699 i dont know what rules of engagement are but you may safely assumer its going to be a weapons free situation
9298700 david axelrods speech as delivered by barrack obama last night was
9298701 stop talking about bill ayers because those ads are killing obama in the polls
9298702 being governor of a small state for less than two years is not consistent with the normal criteria for determining whos of presidential caliber
9298703 dames is unqualified now fetch me another drink honey and ill slip a dollar in your garter
9298704 the fact that he would have to go to somebody who is clearly unqualified to be president makes obama look like an elder statesman
9298705 and alaska is a much smaller state than illinois the political base of barack obama
9298706 the authors quote four scholars attacking gov palins fitness for the office of vice president among them
9298707 the welcoming committee is a criminal enterprise made up of 35 anarchists who are intent on committing criminal acts before and during the republican national convention
9298708 these acts include tactics to blockade and disable delegate buses breaching venue security and injuring police officers they have recruited assistance in their criminal conspiracy from other anarchists groups throughout the country through their plans and actions they have exhibited a blatant disregard for the law and the safety of others
9298709 how sad is it that obama is running his campaign so badly that we are now hoping he used finger quotes for a natural disaster to stop the palin pain

9298718 in trying to smear sarah palin theyre implying that the daughter is a little slut getting knocked up
9298719 no the only one it hurts reputation wise is the daughter who is not as far as i know running for office but thats the point of course to inflict pain on the family through nasty rumors to hurt the parents by attacking their children
9298720 look this is a stupid rumor lets just let it go
9298721 youve got a real nice daughter there youve got to be careful she might get knocked up with some retard brat just when your political career was goin somewhere
9298722 heck given that shes in alaska which borders two other countries yes leftists theres canada and russia she might have more experience than obama and biden together

9298727 i know someone on shack or left4dead411 someone was like oh you can see they slowed it down on the 360 did it seem slower to you yeah we didnt slow it down at all for the 360 our tech guys our really smart guys did a ton of work so that the 360 users see the same things the pc users do everythings the same when we do split screen we do a couple little things just graphically there to smooth things out but its still the same speed same match same number of zombies so as we were working on it guys were like we have this big hammer we can make less zombies and were always like no we can not use that hammer we must fix it in other ways there is a little bit of auto aim that happens you can either do an auto aim by helping you to track a target or by helping you to shoot what you think youre aiming at we wanted you to shoot what you think youre aiming at a lot of times your friends are there you have friendly fire on but you just want to shoot we also do little cheats like if youre helping someone up you dont get hit by friendly fire if youre down and a hunters on top of you you dont get friendly fire we want friendly fire to add to the fun and not be this big negative so on normal difficulty it does barely any damage
9298728 you know i didnt actually say a flamethrower laughs i got a lot of shit for that there are a bunch of different ideas weve got any cool thing from a zombie movie zombie game there are a lot of cool things we want to do personally i like lighting everything on fire in development i actually had a key where i could just set anything i want on fire laughs youd do it too right there are some other ideas we had for versus mode that weve played around with there are some other modes with co op that we played around with as well that well start releasing afterward we see outside playtesters playing the scenarios for about an hour and a half to two hours so its about the length of a movie they kind of feel about right well maybe look at making some shorter experiences and some maybe even longer experiences
9298729 we talked it over with ea they have a lot of insight into when the optimal time for release is
9298730 no ps3 no ps3 no ps3 long pause maybe laughs
9298731 yes thats our plan for the tf2 maps when we release the big xbox 360 update its going to include everything
9298732 the biggest problem with the console version of tf2 is that we had kids with dial up connections saying i can host a 16 player server we had a little thing that said oh no you cant and theyre like oh yes i can and so then people would connect have a horrible experience and go this game sucks and so one of the things were doing is hosting dedicated servers its a program microsoft offers where theyll come in theyve got to certify our data center they work with us on it and they let us host the servers and that way were able to ramp it up and have a better experience for our users and of course you wont have to connect to a dedicated server you can do split screen you can play alone you can do system link you can do peer connection you can do all those things but if you go in the match menu and you hit quick match itll try to find you a dedicated server to play on weve already started doing some server hosting for tf2 well have dedicated servers on pc as well to a lesser extent probably just because theres so much there already
9298733 weve talked about that i personally prefer it i used to hate it in tf2 now i kind of like it sometimes depending on the mood im in but in this youre like hey douuuuggg hey douuuuugg im over here ahhhh there is a ton of trash talk it really is an evil game when you play it in versus mode but when people play co op you can hear them laughing down the hall co op its laughing and having a good time punctuated with profanity
9298734 i think well be starting that in october were still on our little if youre read the press release were still officially on our tour laughs so theres only so many of us that do the press vegas next week england after that and russia well see how that goes

9298753 but in this instance where she really seems to bring absolutely nothing else to the table it really does appear to be a token gesture to try to win over disenchanted hillary supporters its so obvious as to be laughable but there is a certain contingent of people who wont care if its just been itching for any excuse to vote mccain instead of obama
9298754 prolly the wrong term for what edwards went through too

9298801 well i know that when senator mccain asked me to be his running mate he had a short list of highly qualified men and women she said
9298802 to have made that list at all was a privilege and to have been chosen it brings a great challenge i know that it will demand the best that i have to give and i promise nothing less

9298830 beginning september 1st we will be limited in the amount of money we can spend in this election and senator obama will be able to spend whatever he wants to defeat me thats why your immediate contribution of 25 50 100 250 500 1 000 or even 2 300 is so important to winning this campaign my friends i have made many promises during this campaign promises i intend to keep first and foremost i promise to put our country first before my own self interest i have put my country first throughout my entire life i owe america more than she has ever owed me i am honored to have a career of service to my country and i would be honored to continue my service as the next president of the united states your support is critical now more than ever and i sincerely hope you decide to join my campaign today with a generous contribution before our deadline on august 31st thank you sincerely john mccain
9298831 women just dont count for much in this here brave he man only republican party
9298832 i dont see the palin choice picking up very many pumas
9298833 i want obama out i want hill in in 2012 period and to do that i will be voting for mccain this time
9298834 listen the only way they will allow hillary to run in 2012 is if there is a woman on the other ticket i have no problem with hillary running against palin in 12 it is never a sure thing lets just keep bo out and let the chips fall where they may this is not an easy vote for any of us but change real change is never easy
9298835 although i dont agree with all of palins positions i respect the fact that being pro life she gave birth to a down syndrome child knowing the situation ahead of time
9298836 its a done deal then if the jewish world review is favorable to palin i know who my pals in the senior complexes will vote for they do vote in blocks they talk not much else to do and theyre active another thing for nobama to worry about florida voted hillary in the primaries but we all know what happened
9298837 i know i wont change in my view ill be against bo for mccain palin right to the bitter end this cycle though it wouldnt surprise if the anti bo sentiment increases rather than diminishes by nov
9298838 not only has jean schmidts tax and spend voting record turned off many members of her own party it has also hurt middle class families across the district who are struggling to keep up with the rising cost of a gallon of gas
9298839 in columbus jean schmidt voted to raise the gas tax on ohio families and in washington she voted to allow big oil and gas companies to keep billions in tax breaks all the while raking in campaign cash from the likes of exxonmobil
9298840 if jean schmidt thinks its ok to take money out of the pockets of middle class families so that her friends at the oil and gas companies can add to their already record profits her priorities are definitely out of whack
9298841 franck noted that a poll conducted by the wulsin campaign in late june found that only half of republicans in the second district are considering voting to re elect schmidt overall the poll found that only 33 approve of jean schmidts performance in congress and only 36 are prepared to re elect her

9298913 lid e est venue dun petit groupe de joueurs car il devient impossible de jouer en ligne faute dun d bit suffisant
9298914 not only in that inning but a couple of others i minimized the damage
9298915 it could have been a lot worse than what it was but i made some pitches at the right time and luckily it worked out for the best
9298916 hes ok he didnt really impress me he beat a team right now that is not swinging the bat well the first inning he threw all fastballs were a fastball hitting team and we couldnt get him when you deserve credit ill give you credit he didnt impress me
9298917 he was good enough to beat the white sox tonight
9298918 alles wat iemand denkt nodig te hebben om met meer plezier te kunnen doorwerken
9298919 o baile de formatura da querida amiga graciane tavares que aconteceu ontem foi tdb
9298920 one citizen editorial writer parked off campus and walked because he couldnt make heads or tails of the universitys parking rules
9298921 this wasnt a decision based on my play i want to make that clear
9298922 they werent comfortable with two guys making big salaries at the same position im not mad or bitter about this but i am disappointed in the timing
9298923 he has been significant to this organization beyond me well see what happens it may not be over
9298924 ive seen rudi practice very few times and cut it loose very few times
9298925 i thought he had a great spring and was doing everything but unfortunately he seemed to suffer from the hamstring
9298926 if shes a quayle type choice or worse the odds are good that shell never occupy the naval observatory
9298927 i think there will probably a tendency for the democrats to do the same thing
9298928 they will assume that her lack of experience on the national stage will put her at a disadvantage and im not certain that will matter
9298929 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9298930 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9298931 we need a vice president who can step in if god forbid something happened to john mccain
9298932 i dont think shes someone who is ready for that 3 a m phone call
9298933 for us to get our message out in what the state has to offer to the nation
9298934 when i first heard it i thought wow thats great for alaska then i thought wait what just happened because of course the lack of experience does jump out at you
9298935 you really have to have a high level of respect for gov palin in the sense that she has this real ability to connect with people and suddenly people dont think about health care they dont think about the economy they dont think about whatever else education
9298936 i said to walt this cant be happening because his advance team didnt come to alaska to check her out
9298937 i must be the worst manager ever in the history of baseball right now walking a guy that just came from being on top of big brown to beat the white sox
9298938 right now hes on a roll i get opportunities to walk him to face big papi i will do it whoever hits in front of him this guy right now is on fire no matter what you throw there hes going to get it
9298939 hes ok he didnt really impress me he beat a team that right now is not swinging the bat well the first inning he threw all fastballs were a fastball hitting team and we couldnt get him when you deserve credit ill give you credit he didnt impress me he was good enough to beat the white sox tonight
9298940 after that first guy i settled down got into a rhythm
9298941 i thought his poise and his mound presence was outstanding
9298942 i mean these guys are winning the central or i dont know if they are but theyre a team thats going to be fighting for a playoff spot and we played well the last two days and hopefully we can come out and continue it
9298943 ill tell you one thing you enjoy winning you kidding me
9298944 ill kick their butt tomorrow well get up tomorrow and learn those lessons
9298945 were better than that and we cant make the mistakes we made and get behind a team of that caliber and expect to be able to come back
9298946 weve got fast receivers on the outside and we took advantage of it
9298947 its a scary moment when an impact player like that goes down
9298948 has done a great job for us this preseason hes made a lot of plays hes shown that he can still rush the passer
9298949 i think he improved from the first game to the second game he showed the ability to be a fullback obviously we know he does need to improve a little bit but after 2 weeks he showed that he has a chance to be a pretty good fullback
9298950 gustav is not looking good are we going to be able to use twitter to help people after gustav hits can we brainstorm some ideas now
9298951 it was a fair evaluation of that position but it was also tough because both guys played well
9298952 i was obviously excited for me and the opportunity but im also disappointed for matt and know the position that hes in
9298953 there were a lot of things that we were looking at it was a whole bunch of information
9298954 part of being a good player is reining those emotions in and being able to control them that was one of the things that we got to see last night he was able to do that after last week
9298955 the bottom line is you just want to be on the football field and you want to play
9298956 i still feel like i can do that at a high level
9298957 have another chance to compete and hopefully take us to someplace we havent been in some time and have another run at a championship
9298958 the offensive line is doing great right now and theyre only going to get better our rushing game is going to be the strength of this team and were going to get those guys in the pocket comfortable
9298959 we probably tried to force the pass as best we could just to get some of these young guys some experience
9298960 it was 7 0 and i looked at the scoreboard to see if there was room for three digits
9298961 were balanced in both throwing and running it but were definitely running the ball really well
9298962 it starts with the o line the veteran group they did a great job run blocking making some nice holes for charles and when i had a few carries i got some great blocks
9298963 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9298964 we got a chance to put our names on the map
9298965 its a sign of a pretty good football team when you can not play your best and come away with a win particularly in a venue like this
9298966 non bcs teams should get a shot at a championship every year
9298967 we never were able to get the defense a rest because we couldnt move the ball effectively
9298968 we were struggling offensively so i couldnt blame him a bit
9298969 we knew that both of us were going to play and it was going to be based on how coach felt
9298970 there was just a look in everyones eye its not something ive seen in the last couple years of utah football
9298971 the most important question is whether ivins was provided with fully weaponized cutting edge anthrax that he could use by merely drying it out as the fbi case requires if not then the cover up explodes in the face of the fbi
9298972 911 plotters bury the evidence of anthrax as their follow up punch
9298973 far exceeds that of any powdered product found in the now extinct u s biological warfare program
9298974 in my opinion there are maybe four or five people in the whole country who might be able to make this stuff and im one of them
9298975 and even with a good lab and staff to help run it it might take me a year to come up with a product as good
9298976 even on a small scale you still need containment if youre going to do it right it could cost millions of dollars
9298977 i know of no other technique that might give you that finished product
9298978 surface tension will pull those little silica particles together onto the big one
9298979 would have to have a lot of anthrax so you could practice
9298980 youd have to do a lot of trial and error to get the particles you wanted
9298981 you would need a chemist who is familiar with colloidal fumed silica and a material science person to put it all together and then some mechanical engineers to make this work probably some containment people if you dont want to kill anybody you need half a dozen i think really smart people
9298982 a schism now exists among scientists who analyzed it for the fbi
9298983 high spore concentration uniform particle size low electrostatic charge treated to reduce clumping
9298984 there is not a scintilla of evidence that would indicate that dr hatfill had anything to do with this
9298985 and is king dunlap protecting kevin kolbs blind side click change we can believe in
9298986 it seems like a long period of time before the sept 7 regular season opener i wanted to get those guys into the third quarter in this last game and ended up pulling them out at halftime
9298987 these guys got a bad rap a few weeks ago for what happened but they dont deserve it
9298988 this one means a lot these guys have had a lot of adversity on them the past few weeks
9298989 i think the biggest challenge was just being good on the restarts and getting away
9298990 nobody was going to touch that no 18 those guys were scary fast it was a lot of fun but he was in a different zip code
9298991 tomorrow will be ours weve won two in a row and i believe our car will be real good
9298992 its one of those situations where youre trying to do your best and you come in against a lot of good hitters
9298993 its nothing to disrespect the opponent its just the fact that you get into a situation that you want to do your best and on top of that i got one of my hometown friends geovany soto
9298994 i had a huge at bat there in the eighth inning and didnt come through
9298995 its part of the game sometimes you hit a big homer and you kind of stand there and look and enjoy the success at that moment i think it was a big strikeout for him
9298996 i had a good year get hurt then have a bad year then dont play one year then turn into a platoon kind of a bench player all of a sudden hopefully this sets me back in the right direction
9298997 we just squandered too many opportunities and left a lot of people on base
9298998 the home plate umpire said that he wasnt tagged the first base umpire said he was tagged in the hip
9298999 one of them was right and one of them was wrong
9299000 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9299001 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two
9299002 when you see one of the best backs in the country laying there in pain its definitely something that you dont want to see
9299003 beanies a tough guy i know were all pulling for him hes gone to the doctors and hell do whatever he can to help this team out
9299004 i was a little nervous but you should be my teammates helped me
9299005 its embarrassing to lose 43 0 in front of friends and family

9299028 mccain is the more traditional conservative republican and he has basically been a conservative most of his political career
9299029 hes done things that have gotten conservatives upset but id say his overall record is pretty conservative arnold is newer and doesnt have the track record mccain does hes been more liberal
9299030 hes mostly conservative he supports proposition 8 which is important

9299114 i recently converted bushs sat score to an iq using the high school norms available for his age cohort educational testing service happened to have done a study of representative high school students within a year or so of when he took the test i derived an iq of 125 which is the 95th percentile
9299115 i think youre safe in saying that dubyas iq based on his sat score is in excess of 120 which puts him in the top 10 percent of the distribution but i wouldnt try to be more precise than that

9299126 yet his knowledge of life in general and how the universe works is so limited
9299127 warlike attempts to build an american empire and remake the middle east in their own image
9299128 all of them are extreme right wingers and the empire is the middle east

9299133 because of our republican party we 1 have much better health care than they do
9299134 2 have 50 higher disposable income per capita on average than they do

9299136 5 and most importantly we are a much more high achieving population than the under achievers in canada and socialist europe
9299137 one wonders then why american infant mortality rates are higher life expectancy is shorter and 45 million people are uninsured
9299138 could be that americans are more entreprenurial than canadians were more interested in enjoying life that squeezing every last dollar out of things
9299139 achieving is one of those unmeasurable buzzwords that could mean anything
9299140 we are not stupid we didnt get to be america by being stupid
9299141 this canadian is not upset not by a long shot matter of fact my wife sent w a congratulatory note to the white house canada is full of sociaists but were not all wackos
9299142 if we were given misinformation intentionally by people in this administration to commit the authority to send boys and in some instances girls to go into iraq that is wrong
9299143 i told her if i believe your son is innocent i will do everything that i can to make sure the people of this country know about your son
9299144 i have goals but i dont have any burning desire for this or that
9299145 power is money its true for both sides thats what creates problems
9299146 i would rather do what i think is right than to sell my political soul
9299147 we were going to do all these things to empower the people
9299148 oh and as for vietnam get over it this post baby boomer is sick of hearing the self centered bleatings of a washed up generation debate over this war again who cares if kerry tossed his ribbons medals who cares if bush snorted coke and missed out on reporting for duty in alabama i dont posted by verplanck colvin
9299149 a lot of assuming is not a good recipe for a killer argument this argument would only work on people who already agree with its point of view
9299150 if there are any good points to be made i e kerrys post vietnam record theyre obscured by a bunch of assumptions that liberals hate the military that kerry would put people like verplanck colvin a painter on his staff or that the entire or large chunk of the military would rather quit than serve under a decorated war hero who protested the vietnam war
9299151 i have never met a soldier sailor airman or marine who would decide whether or not to re enlist based on who the president was re enlistment is a much more personal decision than that
9299152 i have never met a soldier sailor airman or marine who would decide whether or not to re enlist based on who the president was re enlistment is a much more personal decision than that
9299153 give me a reason to vote for kerry that isnt based in how bad bush is
9299154 say what you want about me i have a job to do
9299155 weve been killing their people for years and we thought we could get away with it
9299156 we shouldnt assume this was osama bin laden or militant islamists its probably some white anglo saxon protestant whos mad at the government
9299157 i cant talk about the election with one of my best friends of 20 years
9299158 give me a reason to vote for kerry that isnt based in how bad bush is
9299159 i dont care if kerry will destroy america he is a democrat and i am going to vote for him
9299160 if you havent seen farenheit 9 11 then youre not informed and i dont care about your opinion
9299161 but kerry also said that he would not have rushed to war as the white house did
9299162 would you or would you not be willing to lay down your life to save 100 other people
9299163 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9299164 its been following us all over cuba ruining our vacation
9299165 they have closed everything hotels restaurants bars museums theres not much to do but wait
9299166 the cases we have seen have all been either elderly or had some immune system deficiencies these were no different
9299167 we may have another case or two in the next few weeks but were confident now weve pulled all the implicated product off the shelves
9299168 i think the fact the company has been open and honest dealing with the public has been good
9299169 its certainly helped get the message out i commend them for that
9299170 he is cooperating and we have enough information to lay the charges weve laid
9299171 were not charging him with any alcohol or drug related offences you can connect the dots from there
9299172 he revved the engine and then gunned it for the sushi place
9299173 you make me feel like im riding on an electric unicorn
9299174 andrej will be a very big part of our hockey club moving forward
9299175 at 22 years of age he will only continue to improve and mature as a player nhl defencemen typically dont hit their prime until 25 26 years of age and we look forward to working with andrej throughout that time and beyond
9299176 this was our first opportunity where we were behind and had to score in the last three minutes
9299177 weve done it in previous seasons but it was important to do now because of the new guys we have our offence did a great job to score when it needed to that will build continuity and a trust factor
9299178 the whole team was on the field thinking the game was over two or three times to be in the locker and see the joy and appreciation all going around it was a special sight it just makes your locker that much stronger this was huge for our team
9299179 you can twist it any way you want this was a team win and had it gone the other way it would have been a team loss the defence did a fantastic job despite the odds being in favour of the offence i think at the end of the season you look back on certain plays and games as defining moments time will tell but this one could be
9299180 its looking more likely than it was before these meetings but the fact that the liberal party is refusing to meet with us is i think a bad sign that they are not interested in co operating
9299181 when one offers to have a meeting and when one offers to have a phone call and theres no response and no agreement to even do that its hard to imagine how you can have a parliament work when you cant even get agreement to have a conversation
9299182 it seems to me that harper seems rather intent on quitting his job
9299183 i told him that if hes prepared to quit his job he can explain that failure to canadians i intend to apply for his job with a team of new democrats and a set of ideas that will respond to the real concerns of canadians
9299184 if you havent got anything smart to say its best if you shut up
9299185 could be any of the following of your organization and its members or activities
9299186 men wearing hideously tight speedo trunks women who look about 16 and dressed as prostitutes and who are loud aggressive and smoke incessantly
9299187 soaring energy prices place an enormous financial weight on our familys budget today far greater than any time in this nations history
9299188 energy costs now consume nearly one fifth of the after tax incomes of low and middle class families double that of just 10 years ago it has come time for a national energy policy that places us on a path to independence this is a common goal to all americans republican and democrat for our economic security our national security and environmental security we must be energy independent within the next 15 years
9299189 there are concrete solutions available we need to develop our own oil supplies in places like alaska and off our coastlines that are currently off limits we must continue to advance our technology in ethanol biofuels wind and solar power and even more importantly for the economy of illinois we need to use available technology to convert our vast supplies of coal to environmentally safe liquid fuels no single source is going to be a magic bullet but by diversifying our efforts we can go a long way toward energy self sufficiency
9299190 all he needs is someone positive in his life and roll model
9299191 its his poll ive spent a lot of time in living rooms at train stations and in parades and im getting great response across the district he roskam has high name recognition hes been a politician most of his adult life the polls will go up and down
9299192 its not an open seat like it was two years ago
9299193 the republican national party deemed that duckworth would not take this karl rove and dick cheney came out for roskam i hope obama will visit the district for me
9299194 the difference between her and morgenthaler is that the out of district candidate is having trouble raising money shes not sparked much interest in grass roots she has not raised much money from labor unions or from congressmen shes woefully underperforming in fundraising you need to communicate with voters and that takes money
9299195 it creates in illegal immigrants the expectation that if you make it to illinois you are home free
9299196 before we come up with any program we have to secure our borders and we just havent done that
9299197 the numbers are in and thanks to representative peter roskam protecting their profits it was another record breaking quarter for big oil while illinois middle class families are being squeezed by 3 97 gas at the pump big oil profits are good news for representative roskam who accepted 100 865 in big oil contributions
9299198 with another quarter of record profits big oil owes representative roskam a big thank you for looking out for their bottom line instead of working on a bipartisan solution to high gas prices
9299199 hey jake old buddy ive got a great deal for you we just bought a foreclosed home for 200 000 ill make sure we sell it to you for 150 000 you can then turn around and sell it for 200 000 or whatever you can get and well split the difference
9299200 do you want governor rod blagojevich to be your landlord
9299201 last night the red sox made 27 outs in nine innings francona is so lousy at his job because he had no plan i can do better
9299202 i know the sox won but thats only because the yankees got 27 outs before they got five runs i can do better
9299203 can you believe franconas team scored absolutely no runs in eight of the nine innings
9299204 curt schilling allowed bernie williams to smash a huge homerun while francona was managing him i can do better
9299205 francona allowed keith foulke to walk two yankees in the bottom of the ninth i can do better
9299206 boston sports teams are like men in relationships the patriots are like the new boyfriend that you really like hes awesome but almost too good to be true so you worry the bruins are like the guy that you just casually dated and you dont really care about him hes just something to do the celtics are like the marriage that was great at one time but has lost its spark and you always kinda look back and think about how great it was and the sox are the hard core abusive husband who just absolutely beats the sh t out of you but day after day you always go back to him cause you always believe that tomorrow will be different and you just love him too much
9299207 and the sox are the hard core abusive husband who just absolutely beats the sh t out of you but day after day you always go back to him cause you always believe that tomorrow will be different and you just love him too much
9299208 history says yanks tonight but then again nothing is forever even the kennedy err curse of the bambino one thing you can count on though when guys get on base the game will slow down to a crawl have you noticed that since both teams are so paranoid about sign stealing every play that may be on defensively or seemingly every pitch must be decided upon in a face to face instead of flashing signals
9299209 youve got to give credit to illinois i thought they played a great game
9299210 my players were real disappointed and that really upsets me a little bit
9299211 ive been in this business a long time and when you win you enjoy it we didnt play an average team out there theyre a real good football team
9299212 were better than that and we cant make the mistakes we made and get behind a team of that caliber and expect to be able to come back
9299213 ill tell you one thing you enjoy winning you kidding me
9299214 i thought he did a nice job of making good decisions
9299215 this just sets the tone for the rest of the year we have a lot of unknowns and questions and we gave a lot of answers
9299216 they have a big offensive line and a great tailback i thought we did a great job stacking things up most of the night
9299217 our pass rush didnt get any sacks but i thought we rushed well and made hoyer throw the ball early he threw a couple of times before his receivers turned around
9299218 cameron had his guy beat the safety wasnt looking at me he was looking at cameron in one on one coverage and i knew cameron would have a good chance to make the play
9299219 but i want to help my dad in whatever way i can before he leaves
9299220 it will dry your skin it might make it peel but it will clean it highly astringent
9299221 hey lets tackle australia then nz and then parts of asia
9299222 we really wanted to take care of the ball making good decisions was a big focus i think i did that
9299223 during the offseason he was very focused on what he was doing
9299224 he had a vision of the way he wanted to play during summer workouts 7 on 7s and things you could always tell the little things he was doing differently hed come to me afterward and say could you read my eyes did i hold the ball too long
9299225 the way he comes out and teaches and interacts with us as quarterbacks its just a very comfortable environment for us hes helped me out tremendously
9299226 he had a whole other confident leader attitude out there in the huddle when guys see that out of you it calms everybody down it lets you know hey were going to be in this ballgame no matter what we took advantage of that
9299227 its still early weve still got a long way to go but weve got a group of guys here that can do it if we stick together and just grind it out i think weve got something special here

9299236 this may be because they are not celebrities but social restrictions in our society mean that much is kept under wraps
9299237 those who display such behaviour are highly insecure people mostly uncertain of their potency they are are not good in bed they indulge in promiscuous sexual activity to keep proving themselves their life is a lie and they lie to everybody it is just like any other personality disorder and cannot be easily overcome
9299238 in our society sex addicts are forced to wear a mask they may appear harmless but a lot is going on in their minds
9299239 nymphomania exists more in literature than in the real world while men are addicted to sex women are addicted to love but there are women who are aware that sex is a weak point for men and may use this to their advantage
9299240 intense counsellings and sessions with psychologists or psychiatrists is recommended
9299241 people think about things which bring them pleasurable feelings the pleasure is usually in the anticipating and planning
9299242 but so many women displaying this level of preoccupation thinking about something once a minute would indicate widespread addictive behaviour

9299256 eight separate landscapes react to tank combat altering their shape when hit and providing an ever changing environment in which to play
9299257 its a series of guidelines were trying to introduce in an effort to get our industry to be a little more standardized in how we deal with our games
9299258 we want as many people as possible to sign this particularly publishers because developers are typically at the mercy of publishers if a developer signs their next game with some publisher thats made up of evil s the developer cant really do anything about that
9299259 on the console you dont release as many buggy games because of the pain of patching on consoles but on the pc weve gotten to the point where we just say eh well just patch it thats bull its wrecking our industry
9299260 were going to release things that are done even if we have to delay it were going to not put in obnoxious copy protection we will support the game after release we have this set of principles and there will be a logo on the game that gamers can trust means the game is done and will be supported
9299261 the only way gamers can get game publishers to change their behavior is through the marketplace heres a way to organize around it were going to look at setting up an esrb type agency in charge of this thing you dont want stardock controlling this it would be an independent organization
9299262 where esrb handles rating content you have this thing saying it will be supported after release it wont have obnoxious drm it will be released in good shape and other things that a user can have some faith in if they see that symbol on the box or in the manual theyll know
9299263 certainly publishers are going to say who the hell is stardock but depending on how gamers react to it it will affect the publisher if we can get gamers not to put up with games that barely function until a patch comes our or calls home every six days to make sure im not a pirate that starts affecting the publisher in their pocketbooks then theyre more likely to take this seriously
9299264 previously weve only talked about it in the philosophical sense that gamers should just expect people to do this but theres been no way to organize or standardize what exactly gamers want publishers to do this is an attempt to do that
9299265 they already have this on the console microsoft sony and nintendo approve this stuff you dont even know if a pc game is going to work and not because of your hardware you just dont know if its going to function
9299266 games for windows does a little bit about this but thats just a checklist they dont care if youre using drm or that kind of stuff this could even be something that becomes part of games for windows down the line but what we want to do is start creating an organizational centerpoint that these are things gamers expect from their publishers
9299267 we welcome any initiative to promote and support pc gaming and there are some great thoughts in this bill of rights especially in regards to the minimum system specification
9299268 get your news from a spinning globe on a console

9299279 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century
9299280 our goal is to provide you the decision maker with the most accurate information to help you arrive at a decision that you can feel comfortable with and a decision that will satisfy your heart and mind that you have done an excellent job of finding the best nursing home care for your loved ones
9299281 to ensure that your loved ones are in safe hands
9299282 i think parents who hover do have fear have a need to control and a need for perfectionism
9299283 the fears can range from safety issues to looking good
9299284 it is important for hovering parents to remember that this behavior will also create fear in the child and may affect their self esteem the children may be insecure and have difficulty making decisions on their own children need to feel safe and secure
9299285 helicopter moms tend to be overly involved with their childs activities not just schooling they have denied themselves outside activities in favor of overseeing the details of their childs education
9299286 unfortunately the child is denied the opportunity to go through some of the rigors of life because mom is interrupting stepping in taking over
9299287 theyve spent many years so involved in the details of their childs education and life that they have neglected their own life and thats kind of sad
9299288 id suggest they take up a hobby get involve in local community groups or develop some interest of their own without involving their child
9299289 the first step to controlling it would be to acknowledge what they are doing it would also be helpful to allow their children to make mistakes and learn
9299290 another way to give up some of the control would be to encourage the child to be independent
9299291 if you have a good relationship with the hovering parent helping them set appropriate boundaries is a good way to help that person
9299292 also you can help them recognize when their behavior is out of balance encourage and support them in a positive way so they can be receptive to the advice
9299293 talk to them about what to expect in the school day so there wont be as many surprises
9299294 and be supportive about their concerns even if you think theyre silly like what to wear

9299347 the last time we lost our house located in lakeview la
9299348 ferry said referring to the havoc hurricane katrina wreaked on his familys home just three years ago
9299349 we finished our new house one year after katrina and now here we go again
9299350 this time if things turn out like it did with katrina we have no interest in going back
9299351 we had just started to rebuild our lives began to replace some of the things we lost
9299352 its not so much the loss but how vulnerable we are its like weve abandoned our post what we left behind anyone can go in and take it
9299353 the electricity was out so long the last time that we thought now was a good time to go visit family
9299354 i have a lot of friends in south louisiana who had just redone their houses and now they are packing up to leave
9299355 we just finished rebuilding the house and have to go through this again
9299356 we brought some things with us but i took pictures of everything in our house and have the pictures with me
9299357 the guys played hard there is a lot to be excited about for florida football right now
9299358 we kind of love fast people around here and demps is fast
9299359 he is not a track athlete playing football he is a football player and chris rainey is a fantastic athlete
9299360 they were tapping on their heads asking to sub out and we knew they didnt want any more of us
9299361 with all the talent and the depth we have i believe were going to be making plays like this all the time
9299362 that was his last snap at the university of florida if he doesnt get it he saw a gap and he took it but he better not do it again

9299366 were very attractive to them because we dress like homeless people
9299367 an important moment because we officially change our rhythm and enter a new cycle
9299368 share tasks to best organize the daily life of children
9299369 were not optimistic we see the bottle as half empty
9299370 its also about the future of france in a world of globalization
9299371 the name alone is leaden in the expression rentree litteraire one hears especially rentree it smells of the back of the classroom and the old eraser
9299372 quieren enga arnos y comprar nuestras conciencias con migajas para acallarnos y decir que tenemos relaci n y confianza con el gobierno
9299373 el mal gobierno nos quiere seguir desconociendo y despojando de nuestro derecho a vivir y a disfrutar de lo que la madre tierra nos da

9299386 the only real way out of this hell i can think of is to have a major accident and perhaps loss a leg or something and get a claim
9299387 i hate it when i have to do things because i have to

9299392 i drove the ball well and i was never in a position to cause any angst or anxiety
9299393 but it was so cool the ball just wasnt going anywhere
9299394 i used the long putter for the first time this week and i made some putts yesterday and today
9299395 no queremos a esta raza maldita en nuestra tierra vuelvan a su tierra
9299396 es un proceso de radicalizaci n facistoide y delictiva hay que evaluar si no estamos pasando a un nivel superior que obligue a usar la fuerza p blica y la justicia a obrar de manera m s contundente frente a lo que ser a ya la gestaci n de un grupo terrorista
9299397 la acci n del gobierno es un golpe a la democracia un llamado a la guerra civil y est casi decretando la divisi n de bolivia
9299398 el gobierno del movimiento al socialismo mas partido oficialista ha sepultado por decreto la democracia boliviana demostrando su talante autoritario buscando la eternizaci n en el poder
9299399 a esto nos est llevando el dictador evo morales ac empieza morales aprob el decreto y luego se fue como un cobarde
9299400 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
9299401 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
9299402 i feel a lot better now though because at least i know i will have a home to come back to
9299403 its like youve been slapped so hard in the past that you can almost still feel it i just know how much work it was rebuilding everything
9299404 an important moment because we officially change our rhythm and enter a new cycle
9299405 share tasks to best organize the daily life of children
9299406 were not optimistic we see the bottle as half empty
9299407 it is such a big jump from high school to college you really dont understand the magnitude of things
9299408 you come on the field and see the stadium fill up and see everybody in red supporting you i dont want to say it is overwhelming but you are in a state of shock almost
9299409 then you calm down and you get used to it week in week out but it is a great experience
9299410 you are used to playing in front of 1 000 now you got 94 000 for the freshmen coming in dont look up in the stands just play football dont look up
9299411 once i got that first lick or somebody hit me i kind of woke up
9299412 when it said zero seconds left on the clock and the game was over
9299413 that was probably when i calmed down as far as my nerves and stopped being so shaky
9299414 you only get it one time to be your first game in sanford stadium just embrace it
9299415 you are going to get butterflies you are going to be nervous dont try to fight it just have fun with it go out there and play
9299416 certainly the age of the individual always heightens that anxiety and fear that people have about their safety

9299419 i turn it over to god and think theres nothing i can do about it and i also think what are the odds ive been flying for 18 years and had one emergency landing thats pretty good
9299420 we never lost cabin pressure so we didnt have to use our oxygen masks by the time we got on the ground the crack on the front of the planes window was huge and getting bigger by the second
9299421 i didnt have any anxiety like the last thing i want to do is get back on an airplane i did feel like the pilots and the flight attendants handled it perfectly
9299422 they were so very calm it wasnt a scary situation until afterward when you think about what possibly could have happened
9299423 problema grav e mizeria rom nii nu reu esc s o st p neasc sunt mult mai indisciplina i diferen a este mare ntre partea n care locuiesc rromii bosniaci i cea n care stau cei din rom nia aceast tab r nu e o zon de care milanezii se tem nu vorbim de un loc de care s te temi ca cel din care provenea mailat la roma nu exist a a ceva n nordul italiei
9299424 its a big difference because its something youve repped the heck out of all through college
9299425 you take thousands and thousands of reps thousands of snaps in games tens of thousands of snaps in practice and then you come here
9299426 and ive probably only taken about a thousand reps here so far
9299427 its the technique you have to work on that every day im doing ok ive just got to keep chipping away every day
9299428 the big thing with him is hes got to break the habit of when he gets tired or hes not really sure what to do he goes back to 3 4 habits
9299429 he goes back to the old techniques i think once we break him of that once he gets through that mentally hes going to be a heck of a football player
9299430 i dont get down i dont get up im pretty even keeled i think thats the way i need to be because theres going to be so many ups and downs to the rookie season all i can worry about is just taking care of my business every day
9299431 but you still see some explosion you still see some hustle you still see some playmaking ability so hopefully that will translate for him into success as the season goes on
9299432 he hasnt had a great opportunity to make a lot of plays i think hes a little hesitant right now hes just not letting it go but hes improved since training camp began 100 percent if he just keeps working at it keeps working at it hes going to be a heck of a player
9299433 its good to get around the football especially around the quarterback
9299434 and i think thats something that pass rushers are measured by obviously sacks so i hope to get a few in the near future im just going to keep working and playing thatll take care of itself
9299435 i didnt know if playing six plays or eight plays was going to make a big difference
9299436 i think a half might have made a difference but we werent going to do that
9299437 his progress has been steady and he has been improving
9299438 hes not unlike any rookie or even high draft picks youre going to have good days and youre doing to have not so good days because you really havent got it figured out yet
9299439 but the great thing about chris and ill always say this is that he is willing to work and do the extra things its going to take to be great hes just got that kind of attitude hes not going to allow himself to fail
9299440 i think im the wrong guy to ask about that obviously we are brothers and now there are even more similarities because weve both proven we have the ability to win a championship
9299441 i guess im just happy for tiki that hes making a smooth transition into the tv world
9299442 ill be interested to see if he has anything to say about a team besides the giants
9299443 when you win that super bowl mvp trophy i think you take ownership of a lot of things you not only get the accolade but the reins of the team too
9299444 i think eli has always been confident in his abilities and confident in himself but i think there is a progression and we talked about it this time last year i know a lot of people had him on the hot seat the great thing about eli is that he has been consistent he has always put in the time and work i think that is what his teammates admire about him
9299445 i know there was criticism but it never affected me i just had to continue to work hard
9299446 i think that the thing thats encouraging to me is that hes throwing the ball better than he did a year ago
9299447 i dont think a quarterback reaches his full potential until his sixth or seventh year
9299448 it was a fair evaluation of that position but it was also tough because both guys played well
9299449 showed up when we played the games he just always seemed to make tackles
9299450 its when the lights come on that your best players seem to really shine i think thats what happens with a guy like him
9299451 he stepped up against some really good tackles and had a great couple of days there and i thought he played great from then on
9299452 the head coaches dont run the teams in the national football league
9299453 in the old days if guys got into a fight it was who won
9299454 i guess the world is divided up between redeemers and non redeemers
9299455 i happen to be a redeemer i think people can be made better and right if thats a fault so be it these guys misstepped they made mistakes they paid prices for it that have been verging on ruinous but that doesnt mean i dislike them personally
9299456 theyre going to make decisions that they think are best
9299457 and marvin and the players and all the coaches do the best with what weve got
9299458 eine medaille ist ja eigentlich nicht schlecht aber ich war so auf das verdammte gold fixiert

9299468 are you going to write a letter about your crappy service at the restaurant
9299469 we are in a period of a pronounced slowdown that will probably last until 2010
9299470 japans decision is very disappointing the south korean government should take immediate actions against the move
9299471 we found that especially services are facing problems displaying dual prices 89 percent of them did not comply with the norms
9299472 people do not pay much attention to dual prices yet but they have to start getting used to it
9299473 i am not sure whether our customers have even noticed dual prices
9299474 we had to stay at work late and rewrite the price tags by hand
9299475 it the campaign is not fair to small tradesmen who have to bear all the costs alone we would like to be optimistic about the euro introduction but so far it has brought only trouble cost and the fear of fines
9299476 to put the problem in perspective fannie and freddie have a collective market value of 8 1 billion dollars in insurance protection exposure for more than 5 5 trillion in insured mortgage instruments
9299477 if youve got a squirt gun in your pocket you may have to take it out
9299478 if youve got a bazooka and people know youve got it you may not have to take it out
9299479 we do not believe the gses will be successfulin raising capital in the public markets on economically feasible terms
9299480 this will likely mark the end of the gses in their current format as an awkward public private hybrid we believe the gses will be nationalized in some form
9299481 after what happened with bear stearns the government cant come in and save the equity holders
9299482 the treasury may have to bail out holders of their preferred shares as well as their debt otherwise small banks may suffer another round of large losses
9299483 breaking them up would be messier than some critics think and nationalization isnt the best way to bring mortgage rates back down
9299484 better would be an unequivocal statement from the treasury department saying that the gses debt holders will not lose money whatever policymakers decide to do they should do it quickly as the uncertainty threatens to upend the fragile financial system and housing market
9299485 never bring a squirt gun to a gunfight mr paulson what the market really wants to know is what the treasury is prepared to do and so the market has called paulsons bluff
9299486 the agreement between the turkmen and russian governments on trade and economic cooperation as well as the accord on scientific technical and innovation cooperation

9299488 krishna kumar birla passed away this morning at his kolkata residence
9299489 there were many business leaders who were worried who were apprehensive who were nervous about the economic changes
9299490 understood the importance and the relevance of what we were doing
9299491 he was an outstanding visionary a great parliamentarian a business leader par excellence and a builder of modern educational and scientific institutions
9299492 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up
9299493 typically about half of our production comes back rather quickly
9299494 but were also working with local authorities to provide fuel along evacuation routes
9299495 appropriate planning is under way to allow for the safe shutdown of refinery operations and the evacuation of refinery personnel as circumstances warrant
9299496 it became clear to us that the amount of time we spent taking care of pennies wasnt valuable in the long run
9299497 they think its a really good idea especially since parliament has been discussing getting rid of the penny its something the country is kind of moving towards
9299498 its something the cafe management thought was really great so were trying it out
9299499 if it continues to go well youll probably see this in our other cafes too
9299500 at the end of the day our cash is rarely off by very much
9299501 but i think at the same time the amount of time its going to save everyone would be outstanding
9299502 i think weve triggered an irreversible shift towards abolishing the penny
9299503 but i dont blame the local retailer for losing patience and unilaterally taking action
9299504 i dont expect to deal with that in the near future
9299505 the reason there are so many is because the penny is not used
9299506 there are still some people here and there that want to keep the penny as a symbol of heritage and the past the government doesnt want to put these people against them
9299507 all the progress weve made other than public opinion would be lost if an election takes place
9299508 but it gives us an opportunity to make it an election issue
9299509 i suggest we hold a birthday party and a funeral simultaneously and not issue any 2009 pennies
9299510 many investors believe october is the worst month for equity market returns this can be partly attributable to the fact some large one day declines have occurred in october
9299511 in actuality though the worst month for market returns is september although the average return in september is negative the magnitude of the decline was no worse than one to 1 5 percent
9299512 the economy is weaker than the gdp data might suggest and is not expected to repeat the growth of the first half
9299513 risks of another contraction in real gdp will remain elevated through the first half of 2009 as labor and housing markets search for their bottoms
9299514 in the face of gale force winds from the housing credit and commodity markets the economy continues to bend but not break
9299515 we saw a slight improvement in auto sales in july but dont expect to see a major recovery for the remainder of the year
9299516 have spelled recession other indicators not a divergence that should continue in the week ahead
9299517 while economic growth seems to be in the minds of everybody i still worry about inflation
9299518 the trend is clearly upwards and will continue to remain on that path if the federal reserve continues to be as irresponsible as it has been until now
9299519 how long can a business keep prices constant when facing an almost 10 percent increase in the price of its inputs
9299520 we were wrong terribly wrong we should not have tried to fight a guerrilla war with conventional military tactics against a foe willing to absorb enormous casualties in a country lacking the fundamental political stability necessary to conduct effective military and pacification operations it could not be done and it was not done
9299521 we will take our napalm and flame throwers out of the land that scarcely knows the use of matches we will leave you your small joys and smaller troubles
9299522 it turns out that we dont see or feel any pluses from membership and if there are some we still carry a burden
9299523 to put it simply we have been cheated because a country really fulfilling its obligations should not have to wait so long to join the world trade organisation
9299524 we are not going to change our manner of negotiating
9299525 some of our partners might like to freeze the process but we want to carry on
9299526 this doesnt mean we should renounce our strategic course towards the wto but there should be some clarifications on this question elementary fairness should prevail
9299527 unless we see progress on that issue we cannot sign off on russias application for the wto
9299528 by its recent actions russia is putting its aspirations at risk
9299529 plain and simple gustav is forecast to be a large and powerful hurricane in the gulf of mexico headed toward the northern gulf coast
9299530 the banks growth projections are likely to be distinctly lower
9299531 but because the upside risks for price stability remain high the bank will continue to keep all its options open
9299532 business surveys so far suggest that eurozone gdp gross domestic product will fall again in the third quarter implying that the region is in the midst of a technical recession
9299533 the ecb may be forced into a rate cut debate early next year
9299534 could be disastrous for distressed banks within and possibly outside the region
9299535 the withdrawal of british and irish buyers from the bulgarian market was prompted by the financial crisis in their countries but also by the bad infrastructure and the excess of concrete here
9299536 a decline in speculative investment will have a sanitising effect on the economy
9299537 real estate for bulgaria was like oil and gold for other countries
9299538 more and more often we come to a point where we see how money that we have reasons to believe came from criminal activities is wired through foreign banks and returned here in the form of investment
9299539 midnite videos realizes there is a market for niche material
9299540 we have 22 different niches and feel midnite videos can do the best possible job with the market of curiosity seekers were a total niche company with videos ranging from midgets to large women to strapons and transsexuals i think this will make midnite videos a fully rounded company
9299541 we played the game we love the game we know how to play and could have scored more i am pleased that we didnt concede any goals
9299542 i am very pleased with the performance because it was a complete one
9299543 i believe that the improvement comes from a completely different attitude we have shown that against fc twente and we have shown again here fulham was the start of the season with tough games before it after the players went away it was some players fourth game in 10 days and we were not ready mentally at craven cottage
9299544 he can be that link between midfield and the strikers and it is the way we want to play i think you could see he was in shape and when he is like that he is very important player for us
9299545 besides the noble art of getting things done there is the noble art of leaving things undone
9299546 amy winehouse was regrettably unable to perform at the rock en seine show in paris due to illness she was taken ill at her house and wasnt able to travel to france for the concert
9299547 there was no explanation of the exact reasons for her absence we were told by her agent at 8 00 p m that she wasnt coming
9299548 we should not be ashamed of the gospel of christ
9299549 we built our homes out of palm leaves i saw animals id never seen before he taught me the medicinal properties of all the plants we picked fruit off the trees we swam with and ate piranhas and of course we had sex for almost two weeks
9299550 i got to stay in the jungle and he got to have sex with a cute young american girl
9299551 its more about getting what you want than getting what you need
9299552 unless you think everyone needs a 200 louis vuitton bag
9299553 women are turned on just by the simple idea of their guy getting off his ass and doing something for them
9299554 give it to me first thing in the morning and ill play handyman all day
9299555 theyll touch my hand and theres all this physical contact or theyll run around in their pajamas
9299556 i was painting the hallway right outside a clients bedroom and she was lying on her bed like a girl at a slumber party with her legs up and her arms crossed and her head resting on them asking me if i had a girlfriend
9299557 its all about the fantasy of being taken by the rough hewn construction guy
9299558 i dont get anybody in my office who says my husband sits on the couch all day and eats bonbons and i want to have sex with him all the time

9299562 if a customer exceeds more than 250 gb and is one of the heaviest data users who consume the most data on our high speed internet service he or she may receive a call from comcasts customer security assurance csa group to notify them of excessive use
9299563 if comcast has oversold their network to the point of creating congestion problems then well disclosed caps for internet use are a better short term solution than comcasts current practice of illegally blocking internet traffic

9299565 es muy lindo ayudar a quienes lo dieron todo en la cancha y recibieron muy poco
9299566 mucha gente no lo sabe pero de cada 100 jugadores s lo tres se retiran con suficientes fondos para vivir dignamente
9299567 hay que seguir ojal que la directiva no se desespere que tenga paciencia creo que estamos en buenas manos con este cuerpo t cnico que tenemos hay buena relaci n con chava reyes y vamos a tratar de hacer todo lo posible para que esto se voltee
9299568 estamos a tiempo todav a estamos encontrando cada vez m s el funcionamiento vamos apenas a un tercio del torneo como para poder rescatar esto
9299569 la verdad es que est bamos muy bien parados ellos manejaban quiz muy bien la pelota y todo est bamos bien pero dos desatenciones una en donde el cad ver
9299570 esas son las aspiraciones que tiene el equipo a la liguilla pero ah est el tema de la tabla porcentual tenemos que mejorar sin duda estamos todos muy mal y esto todos juntos lo vamos a sacar tengo plena confianza en hacerlo
9299571 tenemos que revertir todo esto porque hay un grupo de hombres y tenemos un cuerpo t cnico que trabaja
9299572 se da una jugada en la que uno de nuestros jugadores est pidiendo atenci n porque est acalambrado eso lo vio armando archundia y pens que estaba fingiendo pero la muestra de que no es de que ya no entr estaba liquidado
9299573 los rbitros se van a equivocar a veces a favor otras en contra pero de repente andas mal y de malas o bien y de buenas no nos vamos a excusar en los rbitros para m armando archundia es uno de los mejores de m xico tuvo ese detalle
9299574 aqu lo m s importante es que nosotros hemos dejado de hacer muchas cosas pero el equipo las sabe hacer tenemos que levantar la cabeza esto no acaba aqu hay que seguir batallando

9299609 se est n pidiendo las asistencias que vengan a atender a un jugador se habla de que necaxa es un equipo marrullero de que sus jugadores se dejan caer y no entiendo por qu si el fair play es uno hay que respetarlo sea cual sea el equipo o el jugador
9299610 nosotros echamos una pelota hacia afuera en el primer tiempo apegados al fair play y para nuestro caso no se da
9299611 para que se cumpla el fair play se necesitan tres partes y ni el rbitro y tampoco los jugadores de cruz azul hicieron lo mismo cuando uno es noble se encajan con uno
9299612 creo que todos estamos con una gran actitud estamos proponiendo esforz ndonos el primer tiempo ante cruz azul no fue bueno realmente pero el segundo creo que el esfuerzo val a algo pero desgraciadamente las decisiones arbitrales nunca nos favorecen
9299613 es complicado que en todos los partidos luchar esforzarte y al final no llevarte nada te deja con mucha molestia pero nunca vamos a bajar la cabeza ni vamos a dejar de trabajar pero hay que poner un poco m s de atenci n en las decisiones dentro de los partidos
9299614 lo m s importante es haber conseguido una victoria esperemos seguir con esta racha y en lo personal tambi n para m es relevante seguir marcando goles y aprovechar la oportunidad que se me est dando de ser titular
9299615 ellos tambi n jugaron y salvaron muchas opciones de gol nosotros hicimos lo que deb amos que era el crear situaciones de peligro pararnos bien y en el segundo tiempo pudimos marcar los goles que para nosotros fueron fundamentales

9299623 it really is astounding how much one can miss the little things in life like a fine wine
9299624 yes my lady but your gold will not last forever especially at the rate you have been spending it on clothes and wine we must seek to turn the money that remains into a power base in slarn
9299625 alin do stop looking at young aldegar like that it ill becomes you to waste so much of your time on futile hatred have you wondered why he and his young lady decided to invite themselves to a meal with sala rotiln and her bedmate tonight
9299626 i considered they had become bored with the marins and those awful children
9299627 those two children saved my life and my money which is one and the same to me in a manner of speaking you have no reason to hate those two so please be civil about them
9299628 i have come to the conclusion that jalia and daniel do nothing without an ulterior motive you really should be warming to them alin because you and they are cut from the same cloth
9299629 there is nothing they could want from the rotiln woman
9299630 she is merely providing support for gally sorn in collecting those swords from the telmarian traders sorn is the real player in this game it is likely that rotiln is not even fully conversant with her plans
9299631 now that is more like you alin you are a schemer and it is certain that gally sorn is one too there were only two people that i have feared in slarn over the years deren sorn and maximus tallis all the others had gone to some school for gentlemen which seemed to regard removal of the balls of its pupils as its primary objective
9299632 as i remember yandin was eternally grateful that those two men hated each others guts had they teamed up to work together they would have been formidable opponents
9299633 i wonder alin would a girl like gally sorn who makes no secrets of her sexual proclivities and her desire for power not be drawn to a man like maximus tallis who is so like her father in many ways
9299634 highly likely except for the certainty of death that such a relationship would bring with it gally sorn does not strike me as a stupid woman by anyones estimation
9299635 that is your one weakness alin your inability to see what love will sometimes drive people to do
9299636 i think the real motive of our young friends is being played out in front of our eyes
9299637 they are kept busy here and jalia aldare has gone i wonder where
9299638 and just when were you going to tell me that we are now docking in tallis
9299639 it was boat company business and i work primarily for them
9299640 our arrangement is nothing to do with information about their plans
9299641 did it even occur to you that this matter might be directly connected with our arrangement
9299642 i would have told you at our next meeting once the steam dragon is underway for slarn i did not want the news to leak out to people like the governor he might have taken it as a sign of boat company weakness
9299643 who can know for certain who are your men and who are not
9299644 well i can see you are ready to play again gil come back to bed and i will see if i can make that swelling go away
9299645 not too quickly though i hope a girl has certain needs that should be satisfied first
9299646 i am so sorry lady rotiln what ever must you think of me
9299647 the problem i was suffering seems to have left me now
9299648 you must call my sala child and i shall call you jalia that is an unusual name you know very ancient if my memory serves me correct i am surprised that there are any left in jalon who still use it
9299649 she died before i thought to ask her why it is too late to ask now i am afraid
9299650 daniel on the other hand is a fairly common name
9299651 it seems everyone in jalon these days gives their children shortened names even royalty even jalia is itself a shortened form of the name jaliscia
9299652 i shall know what to call jalia when she next acts like a naughty little girl
9299653 i thank you for your conversation but i am very tired after a busy day in bratin i am sure that lady rotiln is also feeling the same way would you mind if we called it a night
9299654 thank you for all your kind assistance im sure our stay in slarn will be much more enjoyable now we know exactly what to see
9299655 you dont suppose they are going to play at naughty little girl and angry father
9299656 ive a good mind not to give you your toy back
9299657 you wont be very rough on me now will you halad

9299661 nothing halad forget it i do not want you to concern yourself in this matter

9299743 even if us oil demand were to decline significantly over the next decade with more fuel efficient automobiles and greater use of biofuels such as ethanol the us which domestically pumps 5 6 million barrels of oil a day will continue to rely heavily on imports for decades to come most energy experts acknowledge the us uses about 21 million barrels of oil products a day even if it cuts oil demand by about 10 percent equivalent to gulf oil imports it is likely to continue to rely on oil imports and make no distinction as to where it is pumped energy experts say
