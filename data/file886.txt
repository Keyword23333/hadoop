8860012 this is an unprecedented result in the treatment of alzheimers disease

8860015 within the research literature there is a consistent call for a better understanding of how drug markets operate and the role that enforcement can have in reducing the damage caused by them
8860016 we were struck by just how little evidence there is to show that the hundreds of millions of pounds spent on uk enforcement each year has made a sustainable impact and represents value for money
8860017 all enforcement agencies aim to reduce drug harms and most have formed local partnerships to do this but they still tend to be judged by measures of traditional supply side activity such as seizure rates

8860059 the person that makes me feel very happy also because she chose vintage was julia roberts when she got the academy award i was very excited to see her when she appeared with my dress
8860060 when i work and i create i am not very approachable so having wires around me and knowing that everything was being recorded really did irritate me a little bit
8860061 we have a number of options everything is on the table
8860062 once they get here it is their choice to stay
8860063 after eight weeks they start to get enjoyable and we start to see the changes
8860064 our company has been here 120 years its our home it was founded here were not going anywhere else
8860065 consumers energys wholehearted dedication to renewable energy goes hand in hand with what were trying to do in the state government
8860066 are poised to make one of the worlds largest investments in alternative energy and energy efficiency creating upwards of 17 000 jobs in michigan
8860067 this is a huge investment in this states economic future
8860068 with an investment of 6 4 billion over five years i feel pretty good about michigans economic future
8860069 this facility will use two thirds of the energy the former complex used
8860070 the real benefit to marshall is the expected 750 000 in economic activity every year
8860071 those 2 000 students will need a place to stay and a place to eat
8860072 its fun to be 1 0 but now heres the situation weve been 1 0 all four years ive been here but things went downhill from there in the past
8860073 so now were 1 0 as usual but we have to keep it going this time we have to play better as we go forward and we have to realize we arent anywhere near where we want to be
8860074 burr oak played hard but it was really important for us to get a shutout and to play really well
8860075 we did that so that was a huge step for us
8860076 we came out really strong scoring 31 points in the first quarter and we want to have that mentality every week starting all of our games really hot
8860077 it was good for us to get this kind of win no matter who we are playing
8860078 we just wanted to play 100 percent its not the players job to keep the score down its their job to play hard and its our job coaches to try and control the clock and control the game and im very pleased with the outcome
8860079 we want to be the kind of defense that shuts people down
8860080 thats what we did tonight and thats what we want to do every week thats what we are shooting for
8860081 but thats the price of democracy to make sure everybody has access
8860082 from a city standpoint this certainly is a cost thats going to be borne by us but its also great exposure for battle creek
8860083 its definitely a lot of work just coordinating things and making sure everything is where it needs to be
8860084 we have a good working relationship with the secret service and good coordination with other departments hampton said
8860085 there has been a lot of coordination and preparation to ensure mr obama comes safely to battle creek and the state of michigan
8860086 there is nothing that we are not familiar with because we get a significant amount of visits
8860087 but its difficult because a lot of officers had things planned
8860088 they dont ask can you handle this or how much money is it going to cost
8860089 im 50 years old now and thats the toughest loss ive ever had we were in control of the game and it slipped away from us
8860090 youve got to give constantine credit they never quit we hit them with a pretty good punch in the first half and they came back
8860091 everyone got tired and everyone is making excuses but conditioning is the biggest thing
8860092 they got tired we got tired we were just able to hang on and continue banging the ball in
8860093 they just turned it up a notch and theyve done it every year weve played them
8860094 thats been the story of this series with constantine were usually a second half team but theyve taken it to us in the second half
8860095 when i was asked to speak it startled me at first and i had to think about it for a moment
8860096 but i made a commitment and i decided to go all out
8860097 the change barack obama is advocating is far more than a break with todays politics
8860098 it is a clarion call for renewal rooted in time tested american values that tap republican as well as democratic traditions
8860099 theres no doubt that john mccain has served in congress longer than barack obama
8860100 but its important to look at judgment over experience and i am impressed by baracks judgment
8860101 the party that once emphasized individual rights has gravitated in recent years toward regulating values
8860102 and the party historically anchored in fiscal restraint has nearly doubled the national debt squandering our precious resources in an undisciplined and unprecedented effort to finance a war with tax cuts
8860103 if we had stayed true to our core principles we could still be in control of congress
8860104 we cant do anything about it they send them to us that way
8860105 by and large i would say that we played fairly well but were going to have to step it up from this point on
8860106 i can think of four great teams in the kva that really concern us right now
8860107 if we have any chance at being competitive well have to play out of our minds and not make any major mistakes for the whole season
8860108 we are asking to pursue the project that we have applied for
8860109 if you wanted to discuss this project you would just do it
8860110 we bought the building and already have started interviewing architects and engineers
8860111 were still trying to identify what the most critical issues are
8860112 we think that the first five floors and the dome center can be well on their way within six months
8860113 the foresight of the city to put in the fiber optic to downtown i think that was a brilliant move
8860114 the idea is to fill up our building with companies that can utilize that bandwidth
8860115 everyone has been so welcoming and so cooperative we dont get that kind of help from a lot of other cities that we do business in
8860116 therell be a lot of things over the next three months i hope will be quite noticeable
8860117 to see the private investment somebody thats willing to commit and put in the private investment to come downtown
8860118 it is a landmark so its fabulous to see their plans to resurrect it
8860119 it was a busy day as we tried lots of different settings on the car to try and improve the overall balance
8860120 once we were happy with the basic set up we did some work on the brakes as this circuit is very demanding in that area we found out some interesting things and learnt quite a lot about how the car behaves with low downforce the track conditions were not too bad and it was quite consistent which is always useful when you are testing

8860128 but he came back fine there was nothing physically wrong and we will press ahead with training him for the leger
8860129 hes still a baby he showed that when he won at haydock prior to his success at royal ascot
8860130 he may also run in the leger but we will decide late on whether he takes his chance

8860153 unilever destijds een van de grootste bedrijven van europa was zowel in engeland als in duitsland heel sterk aanwezig
8860154 dat is een heel confronterende positie hoe ga je daarmee om als bedrijf
8860155 volgens de naziwetgeving kon het concern als een joods bedrijf gedefinieerd worden
8860156 unilever kreeg door zijn grootte een eigen rijkscommissaris net als nederland seyss inquart kreeg doordat het bedrijf die voor zijn karretje wist te spannen werkte dat in zijn voordeel
8860157 het bedrijf ondersteunde de nederlandse regering in ballingschap met geld en menskracht

8860169 hes taller than me but i believe im going to be stronger
8860170 when people started saying manny can beat you and manny can knock you out and especially when freddie roach started saying oscar cant pull the trigger or manny pacquiao the fighter i train can beat you it started to become a challenge to me
8860171 now its very personal especially when manny pacquiao beat all the legendary mexican fighters from mexico to me its a challenge people are talking people are talking that manny pacquiao can beat me well well see dec 6
8860172 thats really what i needed to see because i havent seen that
8860173 ive only seen a couple of carries and when youre only getting a couple of carries its hard to have that kind of swagger as he got going he felt pretty good and it was nice to see him score
8860174 thats a hard one because im really wanting to see him get the live snaps but theres still that clock in his head and in our head that says you know what
8860175 i think hes real close well have him ready this week to play and thats the plan
8860176 ive still got a couple tricks up my sleeve its just making plays taking what the defense gives me and if thats something that i have to do i have the ability to do it
8860177 i think i was pressing a little bit just trying to create something early in the preseason just coming off the injury today i felt more relaxed
8860178 just to make plays and finally get the crowd reaction on your side felt good
8860179 youve got a lot of adrenaline you always want to be in that spot to be able to drive in the winning run so i just have fun with it and try to stay as relaxed as i can
8860180 its amazing that it was as long as it was
8860181 yeah its nice to win two in a row but the goals not to win two in a row the goals to win a lot more than that
8860182 ive spent bits of every season the last four years up and down
8860183 was a bit of a surprise but it wasnt something i was going to let bother me i was going to go down there and get my work in and get back up here as quick as i could
8860184 i dont want to put too much pressure on that if you start focusing on that number you might try too hard or overdo it itd be nice
8860185 to be told i might not be able to play again and to make it back to the big leagues
8860186 i enjoy it i take everything a lot lighter i have a lot more fun im a lot more relaxed with it
8860187 i think thats part of the reason why im not being successful
8860188 when i was in the minors i always started like 100 and everybody was really worried about me but ive always trusted in my tools and i know that i can do it
8860189 but you dont ever make promises in this business you just go down you do your best you get your swing back and you earn your way back up
8860190 something thats deep in the left field corner a cameraman from a certain angle might be more inclined to focus on the player well now he might be a little bit wider and keep an eye on the tip of the fence
8860191 because we know what were doing the camera guys know what theyre doing its up to major league baseball to take it from there
8860192 you look at the names on that list its a storied organization so to be on that list and to be with those guys is really neat

8860206 the situation is now fully under control and no fresh incident of violence was reported since yesterday
8860207 as the situation witnessed substantial improvement nearly 5 000 people were accommodated in relief camps set up at seven places in kandhamal and free kitchens were opened
8860208 i am confident that this year too we will be more or less correct on our assessment of gdp growth and the economy will grow close to eight per cent
8860209 it is on expected lines when eac came out with the gdp projection monsoon conditions were not clear if monsoon turns out to be good which seems to be the case there could be some upside
8860210 the investment gdp ratio has risen to 37 9 per cent which means gdp growth is likely to be maintained
8860211 i expect that the figures would be flat below 7 9 per cent in the next quarter
8860212 but the expected output has not been achieved suicides of farmers have not come down to numbers we were expecting along with debts there are other social problems also which have resulted in suicides in the remaining period of the package we would now address all such problems through farmer orientation by organising constructive projects
8860213 they want to form a parallel government they want to challenge the writ of the government and we have decided that we will not allow the militants to do that
8860214 there is no role for the central government it is for the state government to decide
8860215 we should not damage investor confidence and at the same time we should not be just to people
8860216 international statements of concern are urgently needed to express solidarity with the victims to help forestall yet more violence and to prevent the further loss of life
8860217 we therefore request that you make a statement to call for an end to the sectarian violence and for the protection of vulnerable communities as soon as possible
8860218 mobs have been attacking minority christians in retaliation for the killing of local religious leader swami lakhmananda saraswati
8860219 the fact that christians have been made the scapegoats and victims of a vishwa hindu parishad backlash is deplorable and calls for urgent intervention
8860220 i will not have any food and water from august 30 if people of these districts do not get full meal and are not evacuated to safer places
8860221 even before taking oath i released all the judges from house arrest now we are committed to restore the judges i have not given any deadline and i think it is not appropriate to give deadlines because it is up to the parliament to take a decision
8860222 we graciously accepted the postponement of the tournament which is a big setback to our cricket because players raised a hue and cry over the security but it seems as if these players just dont understand the problems being faced by us
8860223 i found out that there were a lot of people with fertility problems who needed help
8860224 we have contacts in the philippines who helped us to find these women
8860225 educated and they know what they are getting themselves into
8860226 how do you declare that the child is yours when the birth is by another woman
8860227 it is not as easy as you think my feel is that couples who go for surrogacy dont know enough about it if they understand what they are in for i think many of them will find that its not worth their while
8860228 it is best to aim a bit forward of the flys starting position to anticipate where its going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8860229 we were surprised to find that long in fly time before a fly takes off in response to a predator or swatter it plans the direction of the jump by making a rather complex series of postural movements
8860230 these movements are made very rapidly within about 200 milliseconds but within that time the animal determines where the threat is coming from and activates an appropriate set of movements to position its legs and wings
8860231 this shows how rapidly the flys brain processes sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8860232 somos el gobierno m s fuerte de toda la democracia en galicia
8860233 the story is about a little boy and his best friend a donkey it is almost after 18 years that a bollywood film has been entirely shot in the valley and the experience was very overwhelming
8860234 the security personnel were friendly because we shot in winter a large crowd used to surround us all the time some women and children were very enthusiastic to work in the movie
8860235 our crew members thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful sceneries of j k at that time the valley was very peaceful and police and locals also supported us we have not imagined that when the film will be ready for release the condition would be so worse
8860236 anupam kher is a kashmiri but even he had some first time visit to some places he was very happy we also let locals to be the part of the film
8860237 somos el gobierno m s fuerte de toda la democracia en galicia

8860244 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8860245 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8860246 hij had een duidelijke en ambitieuze agenda vooral op het punt van onderwijs zorg en energie was hij heel overtuigend
8860247 dat echode kennedy die zei dat hij binnen tien jaar iemand op de maan zou zetten
8860248 het is nu duidelijk dat een zwarte man president van amerika kan worden het glazen plafond is doorbroken
8860249 niet zozeer wat hij zei maar hoe hij het zei maakte diepe indruk op me
8860250 obama gaf handen en voeten aan de verandering die de vs volgens hem nodig heeft en daar hoort samenwerking met de rest van de wereld bij
8860251 vroeger keek ik altijd wat kritisch naar de amerikaanse manier van campagne voeren maar dat is wel veranderd natuurlijk er wordt nog steeds veel met modder gegooid en het gaat meer om de persoon dan om de inhoud maar dit heeft ook zijn voordelen het persoonlijk maken van de campagne maakt abstracte zaken ook meer tastbaar
8860252 hoe mensen in amerika in het openbaar kunnen praten dat zie je in nederland niet
8860253 i prefer the word extortion the x makes it cool
8860254 there are times when i just really needed him and he just wasnt there
8860255 ive been incarcerated for eight months and jays been everywhere and he hasnt mentioned one thing about tell her i love her
8860256 this letter really emphasised it and we said thats it
8860257 it doesnt sound like much but it all adds up
8860258 thats the little ways people are saving pennies at the moment
8860259 once the ground has been declared non organic you shouldnt go back to it
8860260 ive shut up about this long enough shes using my daughter people never even knew who samantha ronson was until she met lindsay she was just some los angeles dj and now shes writing a book i am at wits end with this stuff this is not in lindsays best interest

8860269 i dont know what kinds of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8860270 cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families
8860271 i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cant meet 21st century challenges with a 20th century bureaucracy
8860272 you dont defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq
8860273 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8860274 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
8860275 the media keeps writing about bounces about average bounces and typical bounces but this year we dont have the same kinds of circumstances that weve always had before
8860276 unless youre going to scientifically survey enough people at one oclock in the morning after obama speaks and thats just not going to happen
8860277 obama will see a significant bump and we believe it is reasonable to expect nearly a 15 point bounce out of a convention in this political environment
8860278 as much as a 10 point lead or even more
8860279 barack obama is ready to lead and to restore americas leadership in the world barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8860280 barack obama is the man for this job he has a remarkable ability to inspire people he has the intelligence and curiousity that every successful president needs
8860281 how to rebuild the american dream how to restore americas leadership in the world
8860282 have been more impressed by the power of our example than the example of our power
8860283 the republicans said i was too young and inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8860284 who identify with the democratic party or independents who lean toward the democrats but who are not now supporting obama
8860285 they want to vote for change but they havent yet figured out a way to do it
8860286 these voters do not understand how obama could sit in reverend wrights pews for 20 years they are not certain what conclusion to draw and they are still watching and wondering
8860287 they dont want to vote for mccain this is all about obama
8860288 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why
8860289 he felt that joe biden would be the best fit for him at this time
8860290 she had 50 percent of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
8860291 if i was a hillary clinton supporter this morning id be scratching my head
8860292 hillary clintons support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt
8860293 theres no place like home and a home and home and home
8860294 the place i lived longest in my life was hanoi
8860295 could i just mention to you jay a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair and i didnt spend those five and a half years because not because i wanted to get a house when i got out
8860296 cindy i refuse to take out the garbage i lived in garbage for five and a half years
8860297 to those who impugn my honor by pointing out that i now support permanent bush tax cuts for the rich after having voted against them i need only mention that after all the suffering i endured for five and a half years i have now earned the right to change my mind
8860298 one of the things ive never tried to do is exploit my vietnam service to my country because it would be totally inappropriate to do so
8860299 joey was always quick once joey set his mind it was like he didnt think at all he just did thats why you didnt want to fight him most guys who got into a fight theyd square off thered be a minute or so of circling around while they jockeyed for position joey didnt do that he decided to fight bango hed punch the guy in the face
8860300 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8860301 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating with him and seeing how he reacts under pressure you learn about the strength of his mind
8860302 should mom move in with us now that dads gone fifty sixty seventy dollars just to fill the gas tank how in gods name with winter coming how are we going to heat the home another year no raise did you hear they may be cutting our health care at the company
8860303 twelve houses between them two rich guys its almost like shooting fish in a barrel
8860304 a strong leader a good man hes pragmatic hes tough and hes wise
8860305 those are the reasons i support barack obama for president
8860306 we need leaders once again who can tap into that special blend of american confidence and optimism
8860307 none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8860308 a coherent consistent narrative of who he is that weaves together the themes of his campaign with his life history
8860309 that is why i love this country ive tried to give back to this country that has given me so much
8860310 look after mommy and ill see you guys on thursday all right
8860311 men jag t nker inte bli n gon hetsbantande mamma
8860312 these organisations have demonstrated the spirit of ubuntu they have closed the poverty gap that caused lack of concentration it has been very difficult for us to learn on empty stomachs
8860313 you brought light into our lives no words can fully explain how we appreciate this effort
8860314 the 15 pupils currently receiving help are a drop in the ocean some are not coming forward
8860315 sometimes its because of pride or fear of being mocked they dont want to be seen to be receiving food from other people we are humbled by the donation from bula mahlo supported by these three organisations they have brought hope to our learners they now know that there is someone out there who cares
8860316 this initiative is of major importance because we have some pupils falling asleep as early as the second class of the day because of hunger
8860317 we want to see them being fed so that they can play smile and concentrate in class
8860318 poverty not only affects pupils education but also their self esteem this is where we thought we could and should intervene
8860319 with the help of likeminded partners gavin varejes and old mutual we have established a project through which pupils whose parents cannot afford to buy them food at school will be provided with lunch
8860320 in fighting poverty in our classrooms we are also creating jobs and empowering local school caterers who are our preferred service providers these caterers families will also not go to bed hungry
8860321 work hard and make your teachers parents and more importantly yourself proud
8860322 i dont want to call it a faction fight but it seems the one clan was aggrieved that they were not welcomed at a funeral then in november there has been no big confrontation but a tit for tat thing
8860323 the campaign which includes the public will embrace the values of ubuntu beyond the cliches
8860324 ubuntu is an organic form of living that can best face the challenges of globalisation whilst keeping the african ethos of respect dignity and compassion
8860325 we accept this awesome responsibility and hold no presumptions that the work will be easy and can be done alone
8860326 the prevalent tendency to shift the blame to others when things go wrong
8860327 hon st ller samma fr ga om och om igen
8860328 allerdings hei t das gar nichts mehr wenn man sich die vergangenen tage anschaut
8860329 im prinzip ist jedes gebilde das jetzt entsteht erst einmal negativ f r die commerzbank
8860330 sie geben gutes geld aus und kaufen sich belastungen ein
8860331 es w re ein geschickter schachzug f r die allianz wenn sie den anteil gegen cash verkaufen denn dann m ssen sie erst einmal keine abschreibungen vornehmen
8860332 the whole world is watching the whole world is watching
8860333 there are currently close to 4 000 centrifuges active at natanz enrichment facility another 3 000 centrifuges are being installed
8860334 if the westerners could make sure that the resolutions would bring us down they would certainly have intensified those they also know that extra resolution measures would cost them more
8860335 the president is of the opinion that the american people can be our influential targets
8860336 it would be gullible to think that america is seeking to relinquish its past policy
8860337 we have received no note in this connection but if we are to receive a note as mr ahmadinejad says we will examine it and will decide with a view to the interests of the two countries
8860338 i thought it was marvelous he laid out what he is going to do its not going to be easy but he is going to try
8860339 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
8860340 he did a great job addressing the areas where he has been attacked patriotism his qualifications for the job and how he plans to pay for all his ideas
8860341 the over the top stadium show surrounding the speech might help motivate his supporters but it might be playing into the hands of his critics who try to paint him as a rock star with no substance
8860342 he described a chance to keep the american promise and he made a lot of promises he is the pied piper of promises
8860343 a government that is powerful enough to give you everything you want can take everything you have
8860344 he is scarier than former president bill clinton because he is arrogant and a true believer
8860345 it was a feel good speech it made you think about yourself and where you wanted the united states to go it was just him making you feel good for the purpose of him getting elected
8860346 there was great resonance with his criticism of the bush administration and mccains support for it
8860347 du liebes kind komm geh mit mir gar sch ne spiele spiel ich mit dir manch bunte blumen sind an dem strand meine mutter hat manch g lden gewand
8860348 willst feiner knabe du mit mir gehn meine t chter sollen dich warten sch n meine t chter f hren den n chtlichen reihn und wiegen und tanzen und singen dich ein

8860353 what i miss most is the times when i was really struggling i miss being tortured with a group of girls wed all bitch together about the hills they made us climb our thighs shaking i miss being in a gross bunk worried if we heard raccoons but i dont miss crying myself to sleep terrified of going to school the next day
8860354 you have no cause to complain i have back fat bigger than your thigh
8860355 if only i were thinner taller prettier stronger funnier whatever then none of the shit would have gone down
8860356 im not going to let my weight stop me from doing things its not who i am
8860357 pour la plonge dans les caf s les tenanciers peuvent en rester au pyramidal
8860358 on last friday morning we had a report of a dead whale on the south coast and we speculated that it could possibly be the mum and we would be doing dna testing
8860359 at sea you cant tell what gender the whale is but when it washed ashore it was clear it was a male
8860360 peters made his decision that he did not seek the leadership of the party
8860361 as ive said before id be very happy if he changes his mind thats his business
8860362 what dr nelson was referring to is that he would be very happy for mr costello to stay on in parliament
8860363 only he can decide if he wants to carry the tag of the greatest prime minister australia never had that was once used for howard
8860364 costello is undeniably the liberal partys best political asset now that howard has gone which is why so much turns on whether he recovers the will to serve which so clearly and understandably wavered in the aftermath of the election
8860365 the dinners been planned for a long time i wouldnt expect him to make any announcements about anything
8860366 their excuse for not engaging with us is not there hes paul mullett gone on leave
8860367 the labor government wont talk to a union of 11 000
8860368 we would like to see working at the football as operational or rostered as part of normal duties and if that is not possible you should get the opportunity to do it as overtime
8860369 if supervisors pressure officers to go to incidents alone that put them in danger or at unnecessary risk they face massive penalties and fines from worksafe inspectors
8860370 the number of police killed or seriously injured through working alone is just ridiculous
8860371 there has never been more police in the force but they are not where they should be in the frontline
8860372 this has been the number one police issue for years people are sick to death of it we are not asking for the earth stars and moon just to sit down with the government and thrash it out
8860373 there is one leadership team in trouble and that is morris at the moment and that is morris iemma
8860374 mr ofarrell is in leadership quicksand and it is quite clear that the member for manly is lining up
8860375 it was really exciting and i was a bit nervous when i gave her the certificate
8860376 i am delighted to have had the opportunity to find out more about how the alannah and madeline foundation initiatives work and to talk about our programs at the mary foundation
8860377 hey brother christian with your high and mighty errand your actions speak
8860378 we are trying to deal with the protesters as gently as possible we are persuading them to leave the compound and will not do anything to those who follow the court order
8860379 move in and circle around me we cant let them seize our stage too easily
8860380 we have told our union members to call a leave of absence to join the rally in bangkok to oust this government which has been damaging the country over the past seven months
8860381 we have a balanced portfolio that is prudently invested in a diverse range of investments
8860382 this means that we have no undue risk weighted in any one category of risk
8860383 a queda da publicidade e a ascens o das rela es p blicas
8860384 i think that some people are trying to figure out some bottoming process and they might have come in here and come in early or they may feel a trading stance is warranted
8860385 we also have approximately 200 to 300 that were previously on layoff
8860386 so tomorrow if theres a need for 20 more employees theyre calling them
8860387 our existing contracts are in place the volumes of what they are though have been reduced as demand has slowed
8860388 one of the key reasons that weve probably managed quite well compared to our competitors and other manufacturers is that we have strategically diversified not only in our customers but in our products
8860389 the state information is invalid for this page and might be corrupted
8860390 ive been on the road flying around the country and staying in hotels for 30 years
8860391 i didnt want to spend months of my life in ottawa while my wife was in toronto
8860392 st phane said we would love to have you as a candidate hargrove recalled
8860393 he suggested i talk to some of his people and senator david smith called two or three days later
8860394 at that point i hadnt ruled anything out but since then ive spent a lot of time talking to my wife denise and decided not to run ive informed david
8860395 but the liberals are as socialist as the ndp now
8860396 canadian banks dont have to clean up from the popping of that u s housing bubble
8860397 i would say that we look at the u s with a tremendous amount of caution given the current operating environment but we also want to be positioned to take advantage of opportunities
8860398 were still worried that a slowing worldwide economy will hurt canada
8860399 however we have not yet seen evidence of a slowdown in our business volumes and our credit numbers remained very stable
8860400 you continue to see the domestic numbers look pretty good
8860401 the key to owning a bank in this environment is to have one that has very good retail banking
8860402 results were ahead of our expectations in the u s and slightly ahead in canada offsetting a weak quarter at td securities
8860403 clearly were looking at all our options and we are talking to an airline in canada to see if we can do anything to move this thing forward
8860404 i think that most people would agree that its a good airline that offered good value with a well known brand name in canada
8860405 we were in the process of arranging financing most of which was in place when a very aggressive lessor seized a plane that action resulted in a domino effect
8860406 i cant believe this i worked all summer to pay for this flight
8860407 its only because ive got the best mom in the world
8860408 they told us the flight was cancelled because of hurricane gustav
8860409 i was waiting for my bag and i saw it on the big television screens that have news every five minutes i nearly died
8860410 its not about the bank of canada the house of commons or the finance ministry instead of playing the blame game i would redirect our energy towards lessening our dependence on oil
8860411 i would encourage you to encourage the government of canada to make it known that it would like to see more regulatory moves south of the border that inhibit speculation
8860412 how do you influence washington i live in washington its simple you hire lobbyists
8860413 you cant do anything about oil prices around the world
8860414 that change is a rush of money into the market and the control of speculators
8860415 it may be having some impact on the market but i dont think its appreciable
8860416 the more surprising the lies the easier they are to expose
8860417 drepung the largest tibetan monastery and once home to as many as 10 000 monks is now a re education camp for monks involved in the march 14 uprising
8860418 there is no more important mission anywhere than maintaining the readiness safety and security of our nuclear weapons we are fully committed to demonstrating to the american people we deserve their trust to do that mission
8860419 each violation of our very exacting standards is fully investigated and every person at all levels is held fully accountable for their actions
8860420 list i do use the ssh with nautilus without any problems but i would like to use krusader to synchronize my files on the two machines now 1000 km apart and in different networks
8860421 es war sehr entt uschend f r mich aber ich muss es akzeptieren besonders wenn man alles ber cksichtigt was in den vergangenen ein zwei monaten passiert ist
8860422 ich habe zu viele unerzwungene fehler gemacht und mein aufschlag hat nicht wirklich funktioniert nat rlich ist es sehr frustrierend weil ich so viel besser spielen kann
8860423 ich realisiere jetzt noch gar nicht dass ich die nummer 1 der welt geschlagen habe ich wei nicht wie ich heute schlafen werde k nnen
8860424 vi vil sikre at det afspejler fakta som allerede er frembragt af retten samt de beviser der er indsamlet i de sidste otte r
8860425 the real footage is at the end not a jumbo and many killed but a fair number of survivors too
8860426 sorry is it april 1 already i cant believe this is even news comcast are being damn generous
8860427 i thought the real reason for the life vests flashing light bright orange was just so they could
8860428 now if we could just get it to translate the bad comments into morgan freeman wed be set

8860430 they will have the same marriage rights as other inmates they will be able to marry non inmates but barred from marrying other inmates in prison
8860431 for instance suppose a prisoner finds out another prisoner has money or other assets they might find themselves coerced into a marriage with a more powerful inmate who might try to lay claim to half their assets
8860432 the law requires they treat people the same so thats a good principle to have in mind when they are drafting regulations
8860433 we take this very seriously and we are working with the machine manufacturer to determine the cause of the problem to ensure that this doesnt happen again
8860434 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
8860435 if this turns out to be a non event the market could really come roaring back down
8860436 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
8860437 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday
8860438 a person can be a drug and sam is a drug shes very controlling and manipulative and its not a healthy relationship for lindsay its not about sam giving lindsay drugs or alcohol or anything there are
8860439 i would sacrifice my own life to get sam out of lindsays
8860440 i told lindsay after she left the cirque lodge clinic that she needed to surround herself with good people when she got out and sam is definitely not that good person lindsay is fragile and sam takes advantage of her and the relationship is too intense and too dramatic
8860441 i see some parallels between britney and lindsay the instability the domineering companion
8860442 she and chris want to live together they play their music loud though so they want a condo thats soundproof
8860443 axl was really weird with her he kept leering at her and saying i want to f k you

8860447 isaf requested that rtf4 complete this important task as no other units in afghanistan were available to carry out the dual security and engineering tasks required for this specific operation
8860448 combat team dagger fought through a taliban attack heat and sandstorms operating in a highly dangerous area to complete this operation
8860449 the successful completion of this mission is testament to the courage skill and tenacity of the soldiers of rtf4 they have significantly improved the lives of the afghan population in these areas and have provided a unique capability to isaf they should be proud of their achievement
8860450 we had expected each bridge to take around four days but the and assault pioneers built them in half that time and the infantry and cavalry provided the team with a first class security screen to work behind
8860451 the team was assisted by dutch romanian and american forces that operate in the area and members of the afghanistan national army assisted our forces with security on the sites
8860452 it was a significant task just to get to there as the attack by the taliban on our armoured column to the site shows thankfully the team came through the firefight unscathed and completed the operation with distinction

8860460 playstation games are rather designed for those who play a lot although its a different strategy it pays off we currently have a production bottleneck with the playstation 3
8860461 you also know however that our business model is not perfect and that we make a loss on every console we sell
8860462 nintendo makes money with the hardware alone which may be a superior business model but the wii is not succeeding at our expense it is not hurting us
8860463 we are already making more money with the games than we are losing with the hardware
8860464 it will certainly take some time we are currently at the stage in which we need to get a grip on the production costs that takes time

8860467 history tells us how the group of ilaga because of their disregard of human rights has killed progressive individuals and even those they perceived to be sympathizers of the progressive movement
8860468 the group has also targeted in their covert operations father peter geremiah of the diocese of kidapawan
8860469 we must put a stop to this group the government should do something to stop it to prevent the conflict in mindanao from escalating
8860470 we want the people to be aware that the ilaga can only rekindle the christian muslim conflict it can fan the fighting in mindanao thus we must all join forces to stop this group from spreading terror in the province
8860471 i know some of the leaders of the group and i already told them that i dont like the idea of reviving the ilaga its illegal the revival of such group has no moral basis

8860496 our work is based on operational objectives and not dictated by fuel requirements
8860497 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in inter ethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8860498 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8860499 we have serious grounds to think that there were us citizens right in the combat zone
8860500 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8860501 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of us president
8860502 and if it didnt work out they could always put the blame on us make us look like the enemy and against the background of this surge of patriotism once more rally the country around a particular political force
8860503 it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8860504 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8860505 police have waited three days to begin their search which we think will start later this morning
8860506 it is expected to take several days to carry out the search because of the scale of the buildings and the extent of the devastation
8860507 there must have been at least three seats to this fire given the vast area it covered and the distances between the destroyed buildings
8860508 but until police begin their search we will not be any nearer to knowing whether mr foster and his family were inside their home at the time of the blaze
8860509 it is a large property and there is a lot of debris inside which will have to be painstakingly sifted through and examined
8860510 scenes of crime officers have already carried out examinations at the various outhouses
8860511 this is being treated as arson and until we can determine whether the family was inside it will remain arson
8860512 we are very concerned for the safety of kirstie and her family who are in our thoughts and prayers

8860579 we have a chance to do something special for this program
8860580 you can only sell hope for so long you have to back up all that talk of being an up and coming program if you want a chance to get the truly elite kids
8860581 right now in the big ten theres a wide open spot for that proverbial no 2 team behind ohio state
8860582 ohio state doesnt recruit anymore they select the kids they want like a usc or a florida but its wide open for no 2 illinois michigan michigan state wisconsin all of them can make a claim
8860583 with the fans and support they have and with that coaching staff staying together they have as good a chance as anybody
8860584 you need to have success on the field in a year like this so you can keep having success in recruiting its all tied to recruiting talent trumps everything else when you put it with coaching and discipline thats when you get a program but you have to get the talent
8860585 my class i believe was ranked 14th in the nation and weve got like six people left
8860586 its basically all about the character of the people you recruit and ive noticed that the character of person that has been recruited lately has been a nice person well grounded i guess you could say
8860587 i would hope things are changing but theyre going to recruit good football players whether in michigan or elsewhere
8860588 no question michigan state has an opportunity and theyre taking advantage of it
8860589 theyve had to reaffirm themselves in the state sort of extend the olive branch to the high school coaches especially in detroit theyve had to work their butts off
8860590 and obviously the change in ann arbor is a factor when you bring in an almost entirely new staff and they dont have a lot of ties to the area theres going to be an opportunity for michigan state
8860591 but michigan is always going to recruit and you know that staff isnt going to turn its back on its own back yard this battle between michigan state and michigan is going to be one of the more fun and interesting stories to follow in national recruiting over the next few years
8860592 well take a big step forward no matter what another school is doing
8860593 and i sincerely hope he eclipses that record and helps his team have a great year
8860594 man so after all those years he averaged 6 75 per carry wow thats big i need to figure out mine
8860595 we were awfully glad biggie came in and put in the t off ense
8860596 there wasnt much passing in the single wing so we didnt have that deception and we had good runners
8860597 pound for pound you wont find a better ballplayer at that time george was somewhat fast but he was awfully shifty he was a crowd pleaser
8860598 somebody came up to him and said in a rather sarcastic way what kind of guy is this biggie munn anyway
8860599 well sir george still on crutches if i remember correctly looked the fellow right in the eye and said biggie munn is the kind of guy youre glad to break a leg for well i said to myself if a coach can win this kind of respect from his players im staying with the game
8860600 i guess as scared as i was i could run like hell
8860601 we had good blocking in those days and the ability to get through a line cut one way or another and get in the open helped
8860602 ive done mostly a lot of reading on lorenzo he was so durable
8860603 would i make the team today i dont know if heart counted im sure i would
8860604 but these kids are so good today so big fast strong today if i were to make the squad i would be happy
8860605 i couldnt wait to get that first tackle out of the way and just see where im at
8860606 he broke up the middle and then i had to go get him
8860607 it felt good i tried to get the ball out but he cupped it he held onto it so tight i couldnt get it out
8860608 the more i think about it the slower i play i could have created another injury if im out there thinking about it so i tried not to think about it and just play football have fun
8860609 he came in and thumped you can hear him hit i mean you can feel his hitting so that was great news for us to get him out there and get the work in just to get to see him out there it was exciting
8860610 im pretty sure yeah im ready to play the regular season ive still got some things to work on im kind of rusty a little bit out there clean up some things technique wise my backpedal my breaks and my angles and ill be ready to go
8860611 the problem was they gave me a big gatorade on the sideline
8860612 you come out of a game like this you feel fortunate
8860613 its are we laying a foundation thats the only thing ive said it from day one
8860614 solid most of the second halves some of the guys wont ever be here so its hard to say but what it does maybe it reflects what were trying to teach we played our base stuff thats all we did the whole camp just trying to get guys in a groove it really doesnt mean any more than that
8860615 the meaning of that is to build on something everything were working on it shows up on tape all our hustle running to the ball being in your gaps we practice to win and thats what we did so we build a foundation in the preseason
8860616 we came off a 97 year of 7 5 and played in 98 everybody remembers that we didnt go to a bowl game we come back in 99 and go 10 2 in 2000 we didnt go to a bowl game right so it goes back and forth
8860617 a lot of programs do that but i think that if theres one message that ive tried to send when we first got here it was that we have to go in the same direction everybody has to go in the same direction i think thats difficult to do
8860618 i plan on winning a national championship thats how youve got to think of everything
8860619 go out there 100 percent and just like in the classroom try to get an a fall down on a b not bad at all
8860620 i think they have a history here of fattening everybody up after a so so season and saying great things are on the horizon
8860621 i think thats the natural progression here i think also the progression is they want to deflate you very quickly as well
8860622 i have to do some thinking we need to do something
8860623 it was terrible to waste five runs like that by giving up six
8860624 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8860625 he ended like he started throwing the ball extremely well
8860626 from a developmental standpoint this young man did everything he was asked to do this year
8860627 i can tell you that i am going to a contender so that makes it a little easier to swallow
8860628 the winning part isnt the key its are we laying the foundation the team is just going to continue to work were working on the fundamentals and our effort just the basic things of football the simplest things of football
8860629 the 4 0 record doesnt mean any more than that
8860630 you definitely feel good about winning im not going to lie and say it doesnt feel good to be 4 0 in the preseason

8860644 hes certainly the liberal leader who has taken his party farthest to the left since mr trudeau if not farther than mr trudeau
8860645 the fact that mr dion opposes any expenditure management in any area of government indicates to us obviously why we have increasingly little common ground in parliament with mr dion and where he is taking the liberal party but more importantly it indicates a direction for the country that i dont think canadians are prepared to accept

8860662 winston peters has been found guilty by a large number of journalists and a large number of politicians when in fact he is completely innocent in respect of these allegations
8860663 virtually conditioning every person in this country to believe in something that is a complete fiction
8860664 on numerous occasions winston peters has promised to clear these matters up
8860665 as late as this morning he was saying it would take five minutes for the sfo to clear it up
8860666 if its as simple as that winston peters would have presented that information months ago

8860672 i take the train home to wilmington sometimes very late as i look out the window at the homes we pass i can almost hear what theyre talking about at the kitchen table after they put the kids to bed
8860673 its a wonderful image its an image that stays with you because it mirrors reality
8860674 the symbol of all things practical and all things comforting
8860675 you dont invite the stranger into the kitchen unless you really like them the living room is preserved for that
8860676 many people dont make as formal meals anymore so the kitchen table becomes a place where a lot does happen
8860677 if youre not in the kitchen youre going to miss out
8860678 the kitchen itself is really becoming a living room in american homes
8860679 you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at

8860687 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8860688 obama also delivered plenty of red meat going on the attack against republican presidential candidate sen john mccain even as he delivered details regarding his own agenda on issues ranging from the economy to taxes
8860689 likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
8860690 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8860691 listen now i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class

8860693 democrats and republicans and independents have fought together and bled together and some have died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america

8860695 you only have so many and he has to bring that hit record again the new version
8860696 you look at all those who came before us and died for the right to vote
8860697 racism is alive and well in america but we also have to recognize that were moving forward
8860698 here im feeling a sense of optimism when you see that obama won in iowa in states where they said hed never win then you have to admit the country is changing and we have to recognize the gains that weve made

8860702 following arkagas regrettable decision to renege on its written undertaking to guarantee all liabilities arising at cork city investment fc ltd until january 2009 the club entered into examinership on august 18
8860703 the fai has already expressed its displeasure at arkagas actions which have placed the club in the difficult position it currently finds itself
8860704 the fai met this morning with the examiner appointed to cork city investment fc ltd
8860705 a meeting of the independent club licensing committee was convened tonight and they deducted ten points from cork city fc for being involved in an examinership process as per section 3 1 2 of the club licensing manual
8860706 this sanction is effective immediately the committee was keen to express that it is imperative for all clubs to adhere to sound financial policies
8860707 i know for a fact it was abramovich who bought shaun
8860708 so there was a problem between him and mourinho from the start and then grant came in and he took on the baton and shaun still didnt get a look in
8860709 how do you think i felt looking at him at the champions league final and hes in a suit
8860710 for sure i received offers from the premier league to return this season but neither am i interested in the adventure nor are atletico madrid thinking of selling me
8860711 im grateful to the clubs for those offers but today im focused on atletico madrid and on doing something good in the champions league
8860712 the preliminary round victory against schalke is a massive moral boost and this european season can be wonderful
8860713 i wasnt so lucky during my spell at manchester united because i didnt have many opportunities to prove myself but in spain with villarreal and atletico madrid ive been able to show im good enough to play in a big european league
8860714 returning to england at some point you never know your fate in the football planet who knows within two years but right now im very happy in spain
8860715 i heard a few clubs were interested but sunderland didnt want to sell
8860716 it was the hardest decision of my career i had a chat with roy keane and he didnt want me to go and tried to convince me to stay
8860717 i also met roy hodgson and spoke to roy met fulham and the team and decided i liked it already
8860718 i wanted to go to fulham ive been out for six months and want to move on and play and be closer to my family in london
8860719 i want to thank roy keane for giving me a chance to play in the premier league its been a dream come true for me
8860720 i want to come home to london as i grew up here but last year was great and i loved sunderland and the fans are the greatest ive had so far it was a great pleasure playing for them
8860721 roy keane wanted me to stay and im proud to have two managers wanting me
8860722 the deal is going to be wrapped up some time today
8860723 it was a temendous experience being involved in a full time set up for two weeks and essendond couldnt have treated me bettter
8860724 but after giving the matter a lot of thought ive decided that id prefer to playing gaelic football rather than making the change to aussie rules which has many stoppages for marks when players catch the ball cleanly

8860742 there were certainly parts of our business where we were too aggressive
8860743 their products arent that differentiated they can paint their products in different colors or sell them in different geographies but a lot of the other players do the same thing
8860744 a lot of things didnt add up they got that liquor license oddly fast

8860746 why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million a year
8860747 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
8860748 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
8860749 if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
8860750 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8860751 afghanistan is dicey i think there are certain areas of the country particularly along the pakistani border that are clearly not under the control of either pakistan or the afghan government
8860752 i am concerned about it but im not as concerned as i am about iraq today obviously or i would be talking about afghanistan but i believe if president hamid karzai can make the progress that he is making that in the long term we may muddle through it in afghanistan
8860753 and when one of his chief advisers the man who wrote his economic plan was talking about the anxiety americans are feeling he said that we were just suffering from a mental recession and that weve become and i quote a nation of whiners

8860762 i really struggled my serve was not working very well and obviously it was very frustrating because i know i can play so much better
8860763 this was a very disappointing loss for me but its something that i have to accept especially with everything that has happened over the last two months i couldnt expect myself to play better
8860764 obviously if you would ask me at the moment if im playing like a no 1 probably not
8860765 i dont realise yet that i beat the world number one and i dont realise yet that i played on the big court i dont know how i am going to sleep
8860766 i dont know when i will realise maybe at the end of the tournament when i am done
8860767 i think i just had a lot more power than she did today
8860768 she plays a game where she hits a lot of high balls which at my height doesnt i think it would be effective against a lot of players but with my height and my reach it doesnt faze me as much
8860769 i think the fans had every right to be a little bit impatient
8860770 they have every right to be frustrated and if theyre angry at the manager then thats just something he needs to deal with
8860771 his choice to sell anton is a business decision and has nothing to do with playing matters really
8860772 there are a lot of factors other than what hes doing on a football pitch and what the manager needs
8860773 it just shows that its all very well having money but if it is not invested wisely you can soon find yourself in trouble

8860781 we remind the company that having set an example with mike carlton it may need to sack all the undersigned if it insists on this course of action
8860782 we believe the company hires columnists on the basis that they have principles it is wrong to sack them for the same reason

8860816 weve raised the discussion already were in ongoing talks i dont want to pre empt anything but im hopeful there will be an arrangement
8860817 bens come a bit forward there weve had a brief talk well wait and see what the result is
8860818 there is a good argument to expand the number of visa players to help the new clubs coming into the competition and not dilute the quality of the competition
8860819 having said that our number one priority is to give young australian players a place to pursue a professional career i think its a fine balance between ensuring new teams are competitive from day one and making sure you dont materially disadvantage clubs that have invested millions of dollars in building their lists and squad on the pitch
8860820 we basically can afford any player in the world including christiano ronaldo if he palmer wants to or not im not going to push for it i want a team thats going to be united in the dressing room instead of someone who will take all the media attention
8860821 do you bring a marquee player thats 26 or 27 thats a socceroo player that can do a job for you or do you bring someone thats 36 37 years old that has won a world cup theres a lot of questions to be asked
8860822 if it was my choice obviously the club owner has the say it would be more of a guest player there is room to increase crowds and bring interest for a period i think the rule is seven games you bring the player you boost the crowds and he goes you bring another marquee player
8860823 one of the main things our boss can differentiate from others is by showing his deep pockets to bring a marquee player he will decide
8860824 i tell you what if you dispossess the roar in general on the field yes of dispossessing the roar by taking their players then no i want to prove we can do it without taking players we do it by being better than them not by weakening them

8860945 there have been private equity firms that have raised capital around the world united states canada asia and a number of those private equity firms were in negotiation with us at various times over the last few months
8860946 weve got a company thats had very significant write downs has got a balance sheet thats in less than robust shape
8860947 on the positive side weve signed an agreement with our banks
8860948 it would be absolutely inappropriate to give any form of guidance about the future of this company
8860949 weve got a tough tough road ahead we need people
8860950 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8860951 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8860952 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8860953 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in inter ethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8860954 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8860955 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president

8860962 what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8860963 i cannot help but feel how proud my father would be proud of barack obama proud of the party that nominated him
8860964 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8860965 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8860966 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8860967 on the granular level he stuck it to mccain and he also answered critics who have said he is too soaring and not specific
8860968 i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8860969 i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8860970 dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy

8860982 it is critical for the hip hop generation and young people among whom only one in fourteen vote or participate in elections and who see the current two party system as antiquated and unable to address their issues to be able to hear other alternatives at all political debates so they can have informed voter choice and become engaged in real democracy the green party ticket represents something my generation can vote for not just an alternative but an imperative this push to have third party and independent voices in national and local debates helps all of us to make democracy work

8860998 im interested in telling narratives and advocating peoples existent feelings the idea of sailing to gaza is kind of crazy but its also very straight forward the whole idea of having just one palestinian whos been forced off their land and who is able to return to palestine this is something that could demolish the whole zionist venture and it just has to be one person if one person can do it then others can do it this project this boat is about giving people the freedom to take responsibility you shouldnt expect something from others if you cant do it yourself and this is true both on a very personal but also on a political level
8860999 americans are terribly ignorant of the human effects of what they support i think this boat is one of the most effective means of raising consciousness particularly american consciousness about the problems caused by american foreign policy americans have to know the consequences of these policies

8861044 you dont invite the stranger into the kitchen unless you really like them the living room is preserved for that

8861047 the kitchen itself is really becoming a living room in american homes

8861064 they wont allow us to send a new group of police
8861065 we will give them time to leave the government house but if they continue to defy the court order then we have to use force to drive them out
8861066 i cannot set the precise time or deadline for this
8861067 of all the evil men of the balkans he is the worst
8861068 our efforts dictate that local government units now comply with republic act 9003 all dumpsites will have to be converted into controlled landfills if they could not put up a sophisticated waste disposal system as stated in the law at least they can establish a controlled landfill
8861069 we are now prepared for this we have green courts now organized we have green prosecutors trained we have green investigators oriented and drafted all this will be fast
8861070 as is already being done in several diocese we urgently and strongly recommend that we pray for peace in mindanao

8861075 it is therefore very clear that private respondent as general service officer of the city of bacolod is the custodian and is accountable for all properties of the city of bacolod both real and personal when the continued reassignment of private respondent to the office of the city mayor was directed purposely for him to prepare a complete inventory of all properties of the city of bacolod such continued reassignment of private respondent was consistent and in consonance with his function and responsibilities as such general services officer
8861076 the question is whether the city government could afford to fund the project
8861077 the function of the vice governor is not purely legislative but also sometimes executive
8861078 whereas hon alfredo bajada mendez whose sincere dedication to his constituents on his first term as punong barangay has shown selfless public service was equally commendable head of a family whom he left truly in distraught and deserted by his demise
8861079 whereas in humblest and heartfelt way sentiments of bereavement in the passing away of an honorable gentleman is shared among his colleagues by his fellow punong barangays in the entire province of capiz and by members of his sanggunian who greatly appreciate his invaluable significant part in bringing the government nearer to its people
8861080 we need to teach people how important are their contribution to this effort we have to know how much garbage we dispose everyday we all know that a lot of people contribute why our canals and surroundings get dirty simply because they are not doing their share we have to educate ourselves on proper waste disposal we should not throw our garbage carelessly we should refrain from using plastics we need to recycle bottles and cans so that only residual waste is left to be collected
8861081 they can come here anytime and they will see how clean our roads are
8861082 we will continue to educate the people in abada escay because the dwellers there came from the 36 different barangays in the city and these people dont care about proper waste disposal if you are looking for mountainous garbage go to abada escay
8861083 we need to educate the people about swm because of health and ecology ecology is a greek word which means home if we clean our own home why cant we clean our ecology the earth which is also our own home
8861084 we need to segregate at source the material recovery facility must be established in the barangay level so that the city will just collect the residual waste which will be placed in a sanitary land fill however the city has not yet started in its swm education campaign
8861085 we are more than 2 years and a half delayed that alone is against the law the government is liable for that under the law government swore to protect and preserve the integrity of the law but here we are just ignoring the law
8861086 do you think we could make a sanitary land fill immediately it takes a year to do it we need to teach our people to segregate so that the volumes of garbage could be reduced tremendously there is so much money which can be made out of the trash i have seen no reason why we will not segregate
8861087 de doelstelling van het openingsfonds is zeven miljoen euro dat is fors maar te doen

8861090 het museum is onder andere in moeilijkheden geraakt door gebrek aan onderhoud de gemeente heeft niet goed voor het oude gebouw gezorgd waardoor het door de brandweer werd afgekeurd die situatie willen we niet weer laten gebeuren je zult dus per jaar een bedrag van enkele tonnen opzij moeten zetten voor onderhoud het budget van de exploitatie zal dus omhoog moeten dit jaar komt er n miljoen bij bij de opening volgend jaar twee miljoen euro per jaar het museum zal zelf ook twee miljoen van de exploitatie van totaal vijftien miljoen euro moeten genereren ik ben onder andere in gesprek met fortis als mogelijke opvolger van abn amro als founder van het museum
8861091 dat moet uitgroeien tot dertig procent van de exploitatie oftewel zon 4 5 miljoen euro per jaar nu is het aankoopbudget 1 2 miljoen euro en dat is volstrekt te weinig om internationaal mee te kunnen draaien
8861092 ik kan me niet voorstellen dat ik direct na de heropening van het stedelijk vertrokken zal zijn er is ook nog zoiets als nazorg
8861093 ik ben nog steeds heel ziek maar het gaat wel

8861104 nialls known all along that his dad was a petty criminal called martin brownlow who was sent to jail myras talking to niall about john paul and kierons plans to marry when she reveals her first love martin brownlow was fatally stabbed while he was in jail
8861105 hes shocked but manages to disguise it then he visits his fathers grave and questions how he has been forgotten just like his father he vows that happy families dont stay happy for ever
8861106 he has no idea until kieron finds out its him
8861107 that hes not really called niall for a start his real name is matthew brownlow and matthew is still in touch with his adoptive mum she shows kieron a photo of matthew and his girlfriend and who should they be but niall and steph at this point the penny drops with kieron
8861108 insteads he confronts niall at the flat wanting to know why niall didnt tell myra knowing the games up niall confesses to absolutely everything and breaks down in tears i think its a relief to get it all off his chest

8861138 once again the earth has become wicked and over populated and i see the end of all flesh before me build another ark and save two of every living thing along with a few good humans
8861139 you have 6 months to build the ark before i will start the unending rain for 40 days and 40 nights if not longer where you live
8861140 im about to start the rain where is the ark
8861141 but things have changed a bit since the last time i needed building regulations approval and ive been arguing with the fire brigade about the need for a sprinkler system my neighbours claim that i should have obtained planning permission for building the ark in my garden because it is development of the site even though in my view it is a temporary structure we had to then go to appeal to the secretary of state for a decision
8861142 then the department of transport demanded a bond be posted for the future costs of moving power lines and other overhead obstructions to clear the passage for the arks move to the sea i told them that the sea would be coming to us but they would hear nothing of it
8861143 all the decent trees have tree preservation orders on them and we live in a site of special scientific interest set up in order to protect the spotted owl i tried to convince the environmentalists that i needed the wood to save the owls but no go
8861144 when i started gathering the animals to try to save a bit of time later the rspca sued me they insisted that i was confining wild animals against their will they argued the accommodation was too restrictive and it was cruel and inhumane to put so many animals in a confined space
8861145 then the county council the environment agency and the rivers authority ruled that i couldnt build the ark until theyd conducted an environmental impact study on your proposed flood
8861146 plus of course im still trying to resolve a complaint with the equal opportunities commission on how many disabled carpenters im supposed to hire for my building team
8861147 to make matters worse the trades unions say i cant use my sons they insist i have to hire only accredited workers with ark building experience
8861148 then to cap it all customs and excise seized all my assets claiming im trying to leave the country illegally with endangered species
8861149 forgive me lord i know ive failed you but i swear i tried every way i know to do as you have commanded
8861150 it would take at least 10 years perhaps more for me to finish this ark
8861151 you mean youre not going to destroy the world after all lord
8861152 why would i bother the british government is doing that perfectly well on its own
8861153 geht es den unternehmen gut dann geht es auch den arbeitnehmern gut
8861154 i think it actually takes more concentration to do it well
8861155 you have to line it up with the runway and you have to do that without sitting right there
8861156 i have a desk job and when you sit at the computer you dont have a lot of evidence of anything concrete
8861157 sometimes its nice to work on a project and have something right there at the end of the day
8861158 you have to take a closer look but once you do you can see its not a little airplane
8861159 once they see the caliber its pretty clear its not just a toy
8861160 that made it hard to really learn how to fly because if you spend six months laboring on it youre afraid to fly it
8861161 you can build if you want to build but really for most the flying part is what tickles your fancy
8861162 now you can have 10 20 people together at the same time
8861163 you have to reverse them when its flying right at you
8861164 you would have these 20 pound airplanes flying into a building at 60 mph
8861165 i think i can sit there and imagine myself flying and wondering if id be airsick if i was doing all the skills that some of those pilots can do and i think i would be
8861166 if i look at the situation in the second quarter we would have to say it was more self inflicted
8861167 whenever youre restarting growth what i can tell you is its an imprecise process there were some parts of the business where we were probably too aggressive
8861168 if i look at the situation in the second quarter we would have to say it was more self inflicted
8861169 whenever youre restarting growth what i can tell you is its an imprecise process there were some parts of the business where we were probably too aggressive

8861177 i gotta tell you its an absolute thrill to be writing farscape again and doing it with rockne makes it even thrillier i just made that word up were hoping this is the first of many miniseries
8861178 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8861179 diz aqui que a criminalidade s aumentou 10 n o acredito deve ser muito mais

8861182 where the early adopters and the discretionary spenders were leading the charge now as we go into the 30 per cent range for planned purchases the change to apple looks permanent what we have in the end actually were sort of there now is that buying an apple is as normal as buying a dell or an hp computer in america
8861183 you want to see what a halo effect looks like take a look at last year
8861184 this years halo isnt to the degree of last years but in this economic environment and the fact that apples hitting its biggest numbers ever means its enough to see apple significantly outperform expectations going forward
8861185 everything else equal apples outperforming in an incredibly difficult consumer spending environment
8861186 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8861187 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8861188 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8861189 i was by convinced rui costa and i know that a really interesting project is in place

8861202 todos os anos ouvimos relatos de pessoas que afirmam ter visto o monstro
8861203 h inclusive relatos de mergulhadores que dizem ter encontrado a criatura
8861204 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8861205 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8861206 he is one of the most promising players in international footbal he is young and has a real desire to succeed and those are two fundamental virtues to add to our team the president said
8861207 ver possesses and extraordinary quality and we are convinced that he will become a very important player here
8861208 we are working towards building a great atl tico team we want to be one of the biggest like we always were and now we have the chance to do that
8861209 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8861210 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8861211 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8861212 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8861213 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8861214 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8861215 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8861216 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8861217 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8861218 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8861219 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8861220 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8861221 who are open to doing something on the production side
8861222 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8861223 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8861224 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8861225 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8861226 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8861227 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8861228 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8861229 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8861230 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8861231 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8861232 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8861233 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8861234 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8861235 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8861236 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8861237 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8861238 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8861239 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8861240 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8861241 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8861242 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8861243 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8861244 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani
8861245 con profonda gratitudine e grande umilt accetto la nomination per la presidenza degli stati uniti

8861252 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
8861253 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
8861254 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
8861255 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
8861256 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
8861257 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
8861258 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
8861259 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
8861260 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
8861261 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema

8861263 la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori
8861264 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
8861265 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
8861266 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
8861267 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre

8861270 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
8861271 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni
8861272 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
8861273 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani
8861274 la scuola ha detto deve rimettere al centro la persona e preparare i ragazzi ad essere cittadini consapevoli dei diritti e dei doveri e conoscitori dei principi costituzionali
8861275 crediamo che alla scuola serva chiarezza ha spiegato il ministro per questo ci sar un ritorno dei voti accompagnati dai giudizi che saranno esplicativi del risultato raggiunto dai ragazzi
8861276 il consiglio dei ministri ha espresso parere favorevole in merito al ritorno al maestro unico per la scuola primaria ha detto il ministro il provvedimento sar contenuto nel piano programmatico per la scuola contenuto nella finanziaria e su cui stiamo lavorando con il ministro tremonti

8861280 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8861281 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
8861282 vi chiedo di farlo con gli occhi fissi al futuro nello spirito dellunit e con lo scopo della vittoria
8861283 obama dovr ricostruire il sogno americano e restituire allamerica il suo prestigio nel mondo
8861284 tutto quello che ho imparato nei miei otto anni da presidente e tutto il lavoro che ho fatto da allora in america e nel resto del mondo mi hanno convinto che barack luomo giusto per questo lavoro
8861285 sedici anni fa mi avete dato lonore di guidare il nostro partito alla vittoria e guidare la nazione in una nuova era di pace e prosperit insieme abbiamo battuto i repubblicani in una campagna dura nella quale venivo attaccato perch troppo giovane e inesperto per essere il comandante supremo delle forze armate vi ricorda qualcosa nel 1992 non ha funzionato perch noi eravamo dalla parte giusta della storia e non funzioner neppure nel 2008 perch anche obama dalla parte giusta della storia
8861286 quello di sapere ispirare la gente infondere la speranza guidarla verso un orizzonte pi alto ha lintelligenza e la curiosit che non possono mancare in un presidente ha mostrato di avere una chiara comprensione della politica estera delle sfide sul fronte della sicurezza nazionale e una ferma determinazione a rimettere in sesto le nostre forze armate
8861287 il mio candidato non ha vinto ha voluto sottolineare ma sono orgoglioso della sua campagna elettorale e di tutta la gente che lha sostenuta hillary far di tutto per appoggiare obama e cos siamo in due anzi siamo 18 milioni
8861288 voglio che tutti sappiano che sono orgoglioso di avere joe biden e tutta la sua famiglia al mio fianco per riprenderci lamerica

8861290 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8861291 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8861292 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8861293 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8861294 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8861295 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

8861302 elles demandaient plus dargent encore plus dargent et toujours plus dargent

8861310 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
8861311 we were disappointed in the decision made by midlothian council as we believe that auchencorth moss is the ideal location for the wind farm and a fantastic opportunity to help tackle the global threat of climate change
8861312 we are now satisfied that our proposal will comply with scottish government and local plan policy with minimal impact on the environment and the local population
8861313 it is hard for me to fathom how anyone who knows anything about ireland would say this this is a signal that the us government will detach if he obama wins the operative word is detachment
8861314 la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori
8861315 grazie al loro impegno alla dedizione dei giovani ed alla certezza delle posizioni tenute dal partito
8861316 che lunione di centro ha potuto riscuoter consensi senza rimaner schiacciata fra le due grandi coalizioni elettorali pdl lega e pd idv mantenendo quindi una significativa rappresentanza parlamentare la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori siamo consci che nel periodo in cui viviamo i veti pregiudiziali e lostruzionismo allazione di governo siano deleteri per un paese che cerca di risollevarsi testimonianza ne la presenza in aula dei nostri parlamentari a garanzia del numero legale per un corretto svolgimento dei lavori di contro votar a scatola chiusa i disegni di legge presentati significherebbe allinearsi su posizioni che non ci appartengono e sulle quali nutriamo forti perplessit
8861317 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8861318 i love manchester its got a really good feel to it
8861319 sometimes i think she has desperate character written on her
8861320 and i think thats the message i dont think thats her intention though
8861321 det er med motork ret jer som med b rn det er ikke anskaffelsessummen men driftsudgifterne der er det v sentlige
8861322 and they took it very seriously confidentiality especially in the online gaming market is of core important and these students were able to finish a great analysis without duress
8861323 be prepared for a wait of on average 3 5 years before expecting any sort of return that is the way the online gaming market works and with patience you can walk with big money
8861324 but its really no different than the enigma of day trading or forex people are not necessarily afraid of investment process but merely of the high risk involved
8861325 its better to look through the mid range online gaming companies for ones with strong growth potential
8861326 i always tell my online gaming clients to wait at minimum 18 months before evaluating the success of a particular investment
8861327 that way those who get jittery early on allow themselves a chance to see the investment through
8861328 with the internet and vast array of research information available starting up is much easier and significantly less costly this allows us to push profits right away and to establish a solid presence in the online gaming field quickly
8861329 its a shame that our industry isnt seen as more main stream
8861330 if more main stream investors got involved through good brokerages wed see a higher division of risk across the board this is especially important in our business model because if we rely on one or two large investment firms they can end up constantly twisting our elbows
8861331 but we have a strong relationship with our top investors and they know the online gaming field very well as a result no one gets gun shy or cold feet
8861332 if youre looking to make some quick cash try investing in a online gaming business the returns can be huge
8861333 we have spent so many resources trying to create reliable rng software using traditional algorithms and caculi theorems but have never really analyzed geometric proofs and associated logic as a means to perfect our efforts
8861334 in general spatial relationships are not trypically meant for use in random numbers
8861335 but were trying new things now that could yield very promising results
8861336 were hoping to try our new spatial studies this spring with
8861337 in the past weve worked hard with many sportsbooks but now realize our strengths are found in the digital gaming sector with specific success with online casinos as the year continues to progress well be sure to keep ahead of all new advancements

8861347 one school holds that he is already the best forward ever to play the game another claims he needs a year or two more to polish up his defense and outside shot before he inevitably becomes the best
8861348 julius erving has brought his dr nicely nicely routine back home to long island he has done nicely on the floor where he has led the youngest starting lineup in the pros average age 22 6 years back from a skitterish start and into title contention he has done nicely off it as well charming the clergy his employers the recently re elected nassau county executive whom he endorsed after extracting pledges for recreational programs for his hometown of roosevelt and even the madison avenue types who are after some endorsements of their own naturally enough dr j now spiels for dr pepper
8861349 too bad america but you missed one of the greatest basketball shows on earth or rather one just a few feet off the earth that was julius erving last week launching himself from various points on courts in denver and new york soaring and scoring passing rebounding blocking and stealing all in the undeserved obscurity of the aba championship finals by saturday night erving and his underdog new york nets had denver down three games to one which is what can happen when humans go five on one with a helicopter the games were not nationally televised but they should have been dr js herois merited more than just local exposure in the first four games he scored 158 points pulled down 51 rebounds had 22 assists blocked seven shots and had eight steals most of them came with the identified flying objects feet well off the ground his body twisting and turning even the nuggets felt like applauding
8861350 i can get a rebound and go ill give it off or if i want ill go all the way myself once i get into the lane its history im like a jazzman when its my turn to solo im not about to play the same old riff
8861351 it used to be said of bill russell he improves every player on the floor now it is said of bird and it should be said also of erving at 32 the other sublime forward in the game dr j concurs with bird that the pass means more than the shot and only gives the impression that the move means most of all bird recalls robertsons impeccability erving reprises elgin baylors flamboyance but the subtler moves of dr j are the ones the players note and appreciate
8861352 on the playground where the move counts as much as the basket winners out is the rule
8861353 i think staying for too long at the head of an organisation might not be a good idea

8861357 the chinese didnt want to let xinjiang be independent before but after they built all the oil fields it became absolutely impossible
8861358 we dont have the power to tell them to do anything they only listen to their bosses in beijing
8861359 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8861360 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8861361 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

8861367 one hundred flys always comes down to finishes and some would say cavics finish was it was at that point 50 50 whether you take another stroke or you take a glide
8861368 you see phelpsy took another stroke he cavic took a glide and obviously phelps arms are coming over at a faster pace
8861369 he phelps made the right decision and the other guy made the wrong decision
8861370 but if he phelps had made the other decision he might not have been as lucky and he might have come away with a second and he would have come away with equalling spitzs record
8861371 im not saying he didnt deserve it im saying he did everything he could do to win those golds and he came away with it but at the same time there were little mistakes by other people that allowed him to do that
8861372 i guess what else is left to do for him except come down and win races he hasnt won before

8861416 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8861417 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in inter ethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8861418 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8861419 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president

8861433 so our present course of action is to continue on this problem with the best of our ability giving it the attention that we feel it very definitely warrants we will give it adequate attention but not frantic attention
8861434 seek out that particular mental attribute which makes you feel most deeply and vitally alive along with which comes the inner voice which says this is the real me and when you have found that attitude follow it
8861435 when we have our body and mind in order everything else will exist in the right place in the right way but usually without being aware of it we try to change something other than ourselves we try to order things outside us but it is impossible to organize things if you yourself are not in order when you do things in the right way at the right time everything else will be organized

8861488 what happened to transportation bills what was the governors role in allocating resources for transportation whats happened to the inspection process how much of an emphasis was placed on doing repair work of rebuilding work of this infrastructure
8861489 gov pawlenty has vetoed some transportation bills talked about restraining government and if it turns out that that restraint so that we could keep from having more taxes came at the expense of infrastructure repair hes going to have some explaining to do

8861506 it will be interesting to hear from the prosecutor when he will be able to have this new indictment
8861507 in terms of finding out about the beginning of the trial that will be vital
8861508 we did not kill up to 90 civilians as has been alleged
8861509 ive seen the account stated from both the u n and certainly from the afghan government ive also seen it discussed that in fact that didnt happen
8861510 we know that when collateral damage occurs that it really does set us back so we work exceptionally hard to make sure that doesnt happen
8861511 were looking to do that as rapidly as we can

8861518 for years my dad struggled with alcoholism i have perfected it
8861519 until we can enter the property we do not know whether the family was inside at the time of the fire which we believe was started deliberately
8861520 once we have access to the house we will find out whether the family was inside at the time of the fire
8861521 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach
8861522 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers
8861523 the latest forecasts for tropical storm gustav suggest a slightly lower chance of major disruptions in oil production
8861524 if we come to the irrevocable conclusion that we should have an election its not because we have polls that are any different than anybody else
8861525 its because that while weve had 2 1 2 years of government all the signs indicate that this parliament is at the end of its usefulness
8861526 isolation the loss of respect and the loss of trust
8861527 i thought it was very important at this stage to say to friendly countries like the ukraine that we were determined to support their democratic choices
8861528 the point i want to underline above all others is that whats happened since the collapse of the soviet union is not a western plot
8861529 its a series of decisions by independent sovereign democracies about the course that they want to take not a course of confrontation with russia but a course of engagement with the west which i think is wholly within their rights and is something weve been right to support
8861530 we dont accept that the choice for ukraine is that either you are an enemy of russia or you are a vassal of russia you can be a partner of the west you can be a partner of russia
8861531 its right to talk about an international crisis theres no question of launching an all out war against russia
8861532 we are in a situation which marks a clear end to the relative and growing calm in and around europe since the collapse of the soviet union
8861533 the last 15 or so years have seen a period in which europes borders have been clearly demarcated new nations have come out of the old soviet union theyve joined the european union
8861534 and the european countries have enjoyed a period of unprecedented stability i think that the danger that arises from russian actions is that that period comes to an end
8861535 we the foreign ministers of canada france germany italy japan the united states and the united kingdom condemn the action of our fellow g8 member
8861536 i wouldnt agree that we really have a threat of a new cold war russia was is and will continue to be the last country in the world that would want a repeat of the cold war
8861537 the most important thing was to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe
8861538 i want the same justice for every marine sailor soldier serving in harms way
8861539 you dont know what combat is until youre in combat
8861540 its an extraordinary situation and there just wasnt enough evidence
8861541 people heard the shots but nobody saw who did the shooting thats not enough
8861542 thought that there was an israeli landing attempt under way and opened fire in the direction of the helicopter hitting it

8861547 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8861548 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war
8861549 we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8861550 we are in a situation which marks a clear end to the relative and growing calm in and around europe since the collapse of the soviet union
8861551 the current crisis in the caucasus does not mark the return of the cold war nor is it likely to mark the start of open warfare between russia and the west
8861552 it is more simply the return of the traditional imperialism practiced by the russian empire more than a century ago
8861553 russia knows that when it comes to conducting a serious foreign and security policy europe is all mouth
8861554 i doubt whether anything tougher than strongly worded communiques will ever be employed
8861555 among our partners there are indeed some who apparently are not so clear about the fact that anyone who goes out through a door must know how to get back in
8861556 once russia sees it has reached none of its strategic goals
8861557 russia will be forced to step back revisit its position and come to a more rational approach to georgia
8861558 russia knows well that the us is involved in conflicts in several parts of the world where it needs russias support such as afghanistan
8861559 they think they can get away with the georgia issue it was very well calculated
8861560 once he does that forms a new government then he has put a final nail on this dialogue so what in fact you are doing is you are making people suffer and therefore declaring a war on the people
8861561 we find that the average number of citations in reference lists has increased gradually

8861588 i would humbly request him that he should withdraw his candidature in the supreme national interest in the interest of democratic stability and also in the interest of the future prospects of his party

8861601 if nobody wants to talk with us on these issues and cooperation with russia is not needed then for gods sake do it yourself
8861602 not because anyone is asking us and not because we want to look good in someones eyes

8861631 to still be in fresno at this juncture of the season is a bit shocking
8861632 i understand this is a transition year and maybe that transition does not involve me
8861633 its who we think going into next year is going to have a chance to help us
8861634 you want a smaller pool of guys because there is only going to be so much playing time within that pool you want an ample amount of time to evaluate them
8861635 just because somebody was in the big leagues or somebody has been here earlier in the year they wont have a free pass to get back up here
8861636 i feel that we all believe we can contribute at the major league level
8861637 weve proven it in previous seasons to sit and dwell on our misfortunes is not going to help us get back to that level
8861638 it cant be easy being in that situation passed up by some other guys and having to wait it out and see what happens in september
8861639 and im not going to sit and play gm im grateful to have had the opportunities that i have had and i believe that ive made the most of them all i can honestly say is that i would love to have the opportunity to play in the major leagues with any team that is willing to allow me that chance whether its the san francisco giants i cant say
8861640 hes been able to command his pitches in lower half of the strike zone better hes commanded his sinker and slider and used his curveball in the right counts it was just a matter of getting his strength and velocity up the key for him was getting back to healthy and trusting his stuff
8861641 im seeing better velocity on his fastball hes using it more i like the way hes pitching hes avoided throwing his breaking ball on all counts and hes using it as a put away pitch instead of trying to get ahead with it his velocity is back up to 93 or 94
8861642 its just consistency at the plate his knowledge of the strike zone has improved a lot hes putting better swings on the baseball just quality at bats thats what were looking for hes driven the ball a lot better this year than last year
8861643 fop just tore up his knee in albuquerque two weeks ago and hes out for the year he had surgery for an acl tear he was making progress he was getting his confidence back and we put him in the rotation for a couple of starts hopefully he continues after he comes back and we see what happens

8861647 i asked obama if hed take a picture with me
8861648 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8861649 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8861650 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8861651 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8861652 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8861653 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8861654 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8861655 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8861656 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8861657 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8861658 podem ainda n o estar a ver as coisas superficie mas por baixo j est tudo a arder
8861659 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8861660 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8861661 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8861662 sure a man is nothing when confronted by the power of the almighty
8861663 im not complaining about this because of my record 4 14
8861664 but i know that would save our pitchers 20 home runs a year and at least 30 runs how many line drives barely clear that wall in right and how many balls barely clear the center field wall and drop into that grass i know ive given up a few
8861665 if i hadnt shaded it with my glove it would have hit me in the face
8861666 at the times we play its one of the most difficult parks with the sun right there in the fifth and sixth inning
8861667 sometimes we practice it and try to get behind the ball and get to the side where we can see it coming out of the sun
8861668 when youre seeing mainly righties its tough to give up on left handed side
8861669 i decided to go back to that i felt that was something when im going good i can bring to the table and help a team win obviously sometimes it doesnt go good but its another tool i have
8861670 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8861671 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8861672 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8861673 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8861674 no one works for someone we all just work together
8861675 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8861676 the message that has come from the russians is one that is tied to invading another country invading sovereign territory
8861677 has a lot of us concerned about what it means now what it means a year from now what it means long term with our relationship on the military military side as well as the relationship between our two countries
8861678 certainly there is potential there because physically the russian navy is operating in the black sea so is the united states navy
8861679 weve worked hard over many years to figure out ways to both operate together operate around each other we know how to do that and i believe well continue to do that safely
8861680 we were strongly in favor of territorial stability and integrity of georgia but after the last act of aggression and act of genocide and ethnic cleansing the south ossetian and abkhazian sides came to the conclusion that they can no longer live together with georgia in one state
8861681 the reality is such that sooner or later the international community will come to an understanding of the existence of these two independent states
8861682 the strategy is to create buffer zones empty territories from which people have been expelled all houses destroyed and fields burned so that it will be very difficult for people to return home even if security arrangements were made for that
8861683 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8861684 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8861685 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8861686 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8861687 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8861688 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8861689 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8861690 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8861691 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8861692 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8861693 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8861694 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8861695 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8861696 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8861697 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8861698 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8861699 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8861700 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8861701 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8861702 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8861703 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8861704 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8861705 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8861706 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8861707 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8861708 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8861709 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8861710 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8861711 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8861712 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8861713 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8861714 zijn niet aflatende inzet voor sociale gerechtigheid in woord en daad
8861715 we did not want this film to be like a corporate movie there are many things in the film where valentino and i would perhaps not want to see ourselves nevertheless it went in
8861716 when you work and create im not very approachable and getting wires round my body really did irritate me a bit but i accepted it
8861717 it was amazing to hang out with them for two years they put up with a lot and they were wired for sound the whole time they were extremely brave the bravest people i know

8861732 exige al gobierno de arag n que se celebre una consulta popular en el arag n oriental para dejar que sean los hablantes los que decidan sobre el futuro de su lengua pues no son ni los pol ticos ni los ling istas los que deben decidir e imponer una lengua sino que son los propios hablantes los nicos que tienen el derecho de decidir c mo quieren hablar y cu l es la denominaci n que le dan a su propia lengua
8861733 en caso que la dga no realice dicho refer ndum la plataforma estudia la posibilidad de organizarlo simb licamente dados los apoyos recibidos por muchos vecinos de las comarcas orientales la consulta se realizar a en todas las comarcas con la colaboraci n de diferentes vecinos de la zona que se han ofrecido ya a la plataforma para ayudar en dicho cometido
8861734 finalmente la pnhc ha realizado ya diversas gestiones para que llegado el caso se presente un recurso de inconstitucionalidad y en ltimo extremo acudir a estrasburgo y denunciar la imposici n de una lengua en un territorio europeo en el que sus habitantes conviven secularmente con su lengua materna aragonesa y con la lengua oficial del estado
8861735 por entidades tanto pol ticas de diversas tendencias moderadas como no pol ticas que tienen como objetivo defender la cultura el patrimonio y las lenguas de cada comunidad aut noma aragon s valenciano catal n y balear de la antigua corona de arag n al igual que la lengua que les vincula el castellano o espa ol rechazando totalmente el imperialismo catal n nacido a trav s del concepto de pa sos catalans que pretende formar un territorio de habla est ndar catalana y que actualmente pretenden partidos de inspiraci n sovi tica y otros de linspiraci n derechista conocido tambi n como pancatalanismo reescribiendo la historia de la corona de arag n y d ndole el protagonismo diferenciador a catalu a y a su movimiento nacionalista surgido en el xix
8861736 un conjunto de personas asociaciones y entidades de diferentes ndoles tanto del arag n oriental como del occidental as como algunas del resto de comunidades aut nomas sensibilizadas ante la propuesta de la inclusi n del catal n en nuestra ley de lenguas de arag n nuestra plataforma tiene como objetivo no parar la ley de lenguas de arag n sino no incluir el t rmino de catal n o lengua catalana para designar a la lengua o lenguas del arag n oriental entendiendo que los ciudadanos de aquellas comarcas son de lengua y cultura aragonesas y que reportan gran parte de nuestra identidad tanto cultural como ling sticamente
8861737 se va a votar una ley de lenguas que nos va a obligar a tomar el catal n como lengua propia la lengua mayoritaria en arag n es el espa ol o castellano en nuestra tierra se hablan y transmiten modalidades propias aragonesas lo suficientemente fundamentadas para fortalecerlas y cuidarlas primero fue la confederaci n catalana aragonesa luego la invenci n de la franja despu s los pa sos catalans posteriormente el expolio de las obras de arte sacro y ahora hay aragoneses que quieren imponer a nuestros hijos el catal n nos negamos completamente
8861738 giornata di poesia di letteratura e di arte per il formicoso
8861739 ini sebuah kesempatan buat saya untuk makin bersyukur lagi dan menjadi terbaik lagi
8861740 dari pagi penjualan tiket sudah lumayan kita seneng banget ngeliat antusias mereka
8861741 rumah ini milik abdul qodir jaelani tidak ada satu iblis pun boleh merampas
8861742 kan tidak cuma harta aja yang digono ghini tapi juga utang digono gini
8861743 obviously if you would ask me at the moment if im playing like a no 1 probably not
8861744 its very frustrating because i know i can play so much better
8861745 i was thinking am i really made to play tennis
8861746 i think what i experienced so far is girls when they play against higher ranked players they have nothing to lose so they go for their shots
8861747 many times they play matches of their life not only in womens tennis also in mens
8861748 ive played the same way ive played throughout the year
8861749 i just havent been scoring the way i would like even though i feel like im playing better the little shots around the greens have cost me but im starting to get that turned around and i expect to have a much better week
8861750 events like the olympics remind us that sports are about building unifying bridges and celebrating excellence of the human spirit
8861751 clearly the lpga fails to realize that broadening the talent pool to welcome international players is in the best interest of the association
8861752 this policy is discriminatory particularly against south korean players who are significantly represented within the lpga membership we are also concerned the new policy may violate state law this is a great step backward in the advancement of golf and we urge the association to rescind its new policy
8861753 the lpga has taken tolerance and diversity back several giant steps after there have been some great strides toward opening the game of golf to all people
8861754 the language requirement is clearly aimed at a specific cultural group of players who have excelled in the lpga
8861755 this is an important thing for the players and for the tour to succeed
8861756 we always love to draw the champion of europe as we did last year
8861757 all of those things add up to good things and get us to the next round again
8861758 i knew i need a triple so as soon as i hit the ball im going to go to third
8861759 the u s wants to expand nato into the black sea and as in iraq this will create a mess in our neighborhood leaving us to deal with the consequences once america eventually pulls out after all if russia is agitated it wont be the americans that will have to deal with them
8861760 the u s wants to expand nato into the black sea and as in iraq this will create a mess in our neighborhood leaving us to deal with the consequences once america eventually pulls out after all if russia is agitated it wont be the americans that will have to deal with them
8861761 the u s wants to expand nato into the black sea and as in iraq this will create a mess in our neighborhood leaving us to deal with the consequences once america eventually pulls out after all if russia is agitated it wont be the americans that will have to deal with them

8861782 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8861783 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8861784 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8861785 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8861786 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8861787 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8861788 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8861789 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8861790 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8861791 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8861792 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8861793 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8861794 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8861795 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8861796 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8861797 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8861798 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8861799 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8861800 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8861801 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8861802 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8861803 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8861804 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8861805 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8861806 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8861807 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8861808 thought that there was an israeli landing attempt under way and opened fire in the direction of the helicopter hitting it
8861809 there was no need for more talks since there was a deal already on the table that was waiting to be signed
8861810 my focus is my training my focus is my next fight im not going to think about retirement i want to be 100 percent focused on the job ive got to take care of and well see after the fight how i feel
8861811 i know everybody thinks this fight will be a difficult fight for me
8861812 i know some people say that its a very easy fight for oscar but i always do my job in the ring and ill do my best to give a good fight and to win this fight i think i can beat de la hoya i saw his last performance and i think im faster and stronger than him and im younger
8861813 the current conditions in the area have made it become more evident that the ammunition requirements have become more pronounced
8861814 podem ainda n o estar a ver as coisas superficie mas por baixo j est tudo a arder
8861815 iya bung ade sempat saya tunda itu malah setahun tak digusur
8861816 iya sudah pak dia kan tetap terus pangkas di sini
8861817 i met land sellers and recorded their statements records of the patwari local revenue official regarding the deal were also examined and collected i will soon submit the report to the government
8861818 the inquiry is mainly focused on the grant of permission to buy the land execution of sale deed and the role of the field staff
8861819 i cant comment on the land deal unless i go through the report if there is any procedural lapse action will be taken against erring officials
8861820 we strongly recommend restrictions in the use of thiazolidinediones the class of drugs and question the rationale for leaving rosiglitazone on the market
8861821 at this time justification for use of thiazolidinediones is very weak to non existent
8861822 further compound their already increased risk of developing ischemic heart disease
8861823 represent conditions that are major precursors of congestive heart failure
8861824 diminished the image of judiciary in the eyes of the common person
8861825 the cash for judge scam has definitely diminished the image of judiciary in the eyes of common person in any country there are two options if the government is strong then the judiciary is weak or if the government is weak then the judiciary is strong in india the latter condition is prevailing for the last many years
8861826 we do not know what is going on in the judges lobby there is a well knit nexus of the judges lawyers and people from other occupations they are answerable to nobody and many of their unscrupulous activities go unchecked
8861827 the appointments of all judges should be made public like it is in various other countries they should disclose whose names are under consideration and what parameters were followed for the selection there should be an autonomous judicial accountability commission involving people that represent all the sections of society
8861828 i have no qualms in saying that this incident has tarnished the image of the judiciary in public life now the public should themselves act wisely and avail the option of right to information rti act to know the facts in this matter
8861829 usually there are supervisory bodies that look into the reasonable functioning of judges and lawyers such cases are rare and we have to make a collective effort to avoid such things in future
8861830 this is a human weakness to accept bribe and can happen anywhere and in any organisation however the thing that such unlawful activity was made public and put on trial is worth appreciation in this case the authorities concerned have acted very fast
8861831 now our judiciary should send a right message by taking a right decision and putting the culprits behind the bars at the earliest it will automatically revive the peoples lost faith in the judiciary
8861832 i am wondering what our government is doing they should immediately call a special session of parliament and impeach the accused party i consider it an utter failure on the part of our government that such a scam involving high profile public authorities happened in our country
8861833 the supreme court of india should provide full autonomy to the cbi to look into the matter but it is only the tip of the iceberg so the supreme court should provide links of all the judges to cbi and tell its officials to check the working of judges and law officers throughout the country only then can we accept any accountability in their working
8861834 our judiciary cannot escape from the public wrath and criticism due to the cash for judge scam this episode will certainly lower the esteem of judiciary to some extent
8861835 there have been stray incidents of violence in parts of kandhamal
8861836 mobs have blocked roads in several places and police are trying to clear them
8861837 although 4 000 policemen have been deployed in kandhamal district which is the worst hit hindu and christian rioters have clashed in several places we have arrested at least 137 people in the district since saturday
8861838 policemen have been ordered to shoot rioters at sight and curfew is in force in all major towns of kandhamal security forces have been taking out flag marches in several areas
8861839 as per our estimate 10 000 christian families have fled to the forests after their houses were burnt and they were attacked by rioters over 4 000 people have been injured and more than 20 000 houses have been burnt
8861840 it is an emotional and spontaneous reaction of people to the killing of swami laxamanananda saraswati
8861841 people are very angry and the government needs to immediately arrest the christian militants who killed swamiji
8861842 remember god has not gone on vacation and left you in charge
8861843 i dont want pills i dont want therapy i like who i am and i dont want you to change me if im as messed up as everyone seems to think i am then ill beat it on my own
8861844 boo hoo josh didnt talk to me at lunch today
8861845 now is not the time to make a move on me
8861846 that bitch is crazy not a bad person just flaky and unaware of what shes doing shes too young and inexperienced and spends too much time trying to prove herself as being a mature adult which just makes her act younger and more inexperienced
8861847 fuck you and your neurotic bullshit im tired of having to explain myself because of things other people who dont really know me say about me ive been honest with you and the only people whos opinions i care about are my real friends who actually know me

8862122 this tragedy catalysed the surgeon to transform the fledgling discipline of plastic surgery
8862123 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8862124 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting
8862125 our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture
8862126 this means that the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechanosensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper preflight pose

8862152 in the koran polytheism is characterized as the gravest sin that obliterates all good deeds
8862153 messenger of allah muhammad peace and blessings be upon him was calling upon people to worship allah alone those who followed the call of monotheism would become his brothers and those who refused would become his enemies
8862154 and most of them believe not in allah without associating other as partners with him
8862155 their faith is that when they are asked who created the heaven who created the earth who created the mountains they answer allah yet at the same time they ascribe partners to him
8862156 you ask them who created yourselves and who created heaven and earth they say allah they believe in allah but they worship others
8862157 they will say there in their mutual bickerings by allah we were truly in an error manifest when we held you as equals with the lord of the worlds
8862158 their faith is in their words allah is our creator who assigns the lot for us and who makes us die but this faith is connected to polytheism since they worship taghut along with allah
8862159 each one of those who worships the creatures besides the creator certainly believes in allah and knows that allah is his creator lord and sustainer and regardless he ascribes companions to him
8862160 but it has already been revealed to thee as it was to those before thee if thou wert to join gods with allah truly fruitless will be thy work in life and thou wilt surely be in the ranks of those who lose all spiritual good
8862161 whoever joins other gods with allah allah will forbid him the garden and the fire will be his abode there will for the wrong doers be no one to help
8862162 lo to ascribe partners unto him is a tremendous wrong
8862163 we are clear of you and of whatever ye worship besides allah we have rejected you and there has arisen between us and you enmity and hatred for ever unless ye believe in allah and him alone
8862164 thou wilt not find any people who believe in allah and the last day loving those who resist allah and his messenger even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred for such he has written faith in their hearts and strengthened them with a spirit from himself
8862165 to whom belong the earth and all beings therein say if ye know
8862166 who is the lord of the seven heavens and the lord of the throne of glory supreme
8862167 who is it in whose hands is the governance of all things who protects all but is not protected of any say if ye know
8862168 but those who take for protectors other than allah say we only serve them in order that they may bring us nearer to allah
8862169 not the least good will your forces be to you even if they were multiplied for verily allah is with those who believe
8862170 so that the borderline between islam and the kufr is more apparent and distinct and so that we could instill and maintain hatred towards unbelief among the muslims

8862313 im really excited to be going to misano in such good shape and leading the championship
8862314 last year the race was a huge disappointment for us a very low point of the season and especially sad because it happened in front of my home fans
8862315 but this time things are very different weve had two fantastic races in a row and we are feeling very strong and very confident we are out to make up for 2007
8862316 misano is so close to my home town of tavullia that i know there will be an army of italian fans there and i hope its going to be a great party for all of them
8862317 last year there was some terrible weather before the race as well so i really hope that this year we have sunshine and we can enjoy a fantastic race by the sea
8862318 i am hoping that we can have a better weekend at misano though i had bad luck there last year another rider knocked me off at the very first corner

8862329 no one can afford to miss the musings of the chatty jancis
8862330 we take this very seriously and we are working with the machine manufacturer to determine the cause of the problem to ensure that this doesnt happen again
8862331 republican mismanagement has really hit home around the kitchen table
8862332 at kitchen tables across ohio and the heartland mothers and fathers are worried
8862333 tonight families are balancing checkbooks at kitchen tables trying to stay on budget
8862334 i take the train home to wilmington sometimes very late as i look out the window at the homes we pass i can almost hear what theyre talking about at the kitchen table after they put the kids to bed
8862335 its a wonderful image its an image that stays with you because it mirrors reality
8862336 the symbol of all things practical and all things comforting
8862337 you dont invite the stranger into the kitchen unless you really like them the living room is preserved for that
8862338 many people dont make as formal meals anymore so the kitchen table becomes a place where a lot does happen
8862339 if youre not in the kitchen youre going to miss out
8862340 the kitchen itself is really becoming a living room in american homes
8862341 you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8862342 i spent 5 1 2 years in a prison cell
8862343 i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
8862344 i was just kind of a void i did seem to function all right but i was just kind of out of it
8862345 when you lose a son or daughter in a war theres a purpose to that but when you lose a son or daughter to a drunken driver theres no purpose to that
8862346 these are made of steel and the reason we chose steel is because of the way people die
8862347 theyre literally killed by a steel machine in fact weve done a lot of things here in steel for that very reason
8862348 it perpetually represents five years so every year its adjusted
8862349 someday we will have a place where children can play
8862350 we wont have any deaths by dwi someday thats going to happen
8862351 i couldve stopped with new mexico but i just kept thinking you know theres no reason why weve got the room why cant we just represent the whole nation
8862352 we arent aware of anything else that is on the same scale as what new mexico is doing
8862353 its such a great way to honor victims of drunk driving
8862354 id like to see the states join is send us any material that they would like for us to display to show on our videos to have available for the public that stops here i want this to become a center for dwi information and the states efforts against it
8862355 i have lots of dreams lots of dreams i dont stop dreaming about this
8862356 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
8862357 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
8862358 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
8862359 i feel a lot better now though because at least i know i will have a home to come back to
8862360 its like youve been slapped so hard in the past that you can almost still feel it i just know how much work it was rebuilding everything
8862361 shortly after moving to powys our friends in london would say whats it like where you live
8862362 we would say its horrible stay away because we didnt want anyone to know how peaceful and relaxing it was in comparison to the rat race in london
8862363 that was 30 years ago but the pace of life hasnt altered a great deal since then
8862364 sometimes the lifestyle makes us laugh especially when people born and bred in the county take things for granted
8862365 for instance i remember being with a farmer one day and i was seeing these wonderful views for the first time i was amazed but all the farmer was concerned about was whether his tractor radio could receive radio 1
8862366 people from outside the area see powys as a rural idyll but if theyre not prepared to sacrifice a few things then they can learn to dislike their new home
8862367 we know a couple who moved to powys because they wanted to escape the rat race but the woman in the relationship couldnt drive and she eventually hated the area
8862368 but in some ways the drawbacks add to the areas charm and thats why some people move here
8862369 for example i recently saw two old women clapping and mouthing well done as a police car drove through llanfair it was hilarious but charming at the same time can you imagine that happening in cardiff or birmingham
8862370 i would never go back to living in the south east of england its over crowded and a stressful place
8862371 for instance if i forget to lock my car at night it doesnt bother me because i know it will be there in the morning
8862372 powys has some of the lowest crimes rates in the uk and that gives us peace of mind
8862373 everybody knows each other and its such a friendly place a five minute trip to the shops can turn into 20 minutes when you stop and chat
8862374 wir wollten ein flexibles konzept f r den markt entwickeln weil einzelne sektoren f r den normalen anleger die gefahr von sehr gro en kursschwankungen beinhalten der delta better world bietet dagegen interessante chancen mit weniger schwankungen verantwortungsvoll zu investieren und an einem zukunftsmarkt zu partizipieren
8862375 klimawandel umweltschutz sind berlebenswichtige themen viel geld wird investiert werden m ssen um die vorhandenen probleme zu l sen starke emotionen und notwendige politische konsequenzen lassen das anlegerinteresse stetig wachsen
8862376 wir haben nun beziehungen zu den wichtigsten denkern f r den klimawandel die nachhaltigkeit und umwelttechnologie weltweit um den puls der zeit der politik sowie des technologischen fortschritts genau messen zu k nnen
8862377 if it does work out well it will probably be a small plus for us
8862378 obviously if it doesnt work out well then the republicans are going to have a problem
8862379 its more of a problem if youre the guy living in the eye of the storm
8862380 our concern is for the lives in the storms potential path
8862381 this is not about politics its about people and doing whats right
8862382 come on guys be statesmen and use this as an opportunity to educate the public about how important it is to fully fund firefighters to educate the public and to be prepared
8862383 listen to the guy thats been on the mountaintop and listen to the guy thats been down into the valley of you know where nothing worked and listen to what i have to say
8862384 i dont have it lingering over my head will he get reinstated will he not get reinstated i just have to keep myself out of bad situations like i have been doing the last six or seven months
8862385 immediately i called my mom because ive been beating myself up but my mom has been through this roller coaster with me
8862386 we want to play hard from the first whistle to the end of the game regardless of the score
8862387 everyone is getting it its going good were excited about it
8862388 i wanted to play three sports football basketball and track this is my last chance
8862389 but i didnt have anything to do with anthony leaving i came because anthony left
8862390 the kids are starting to buy in and join forces kyle north has been showing a lot of leadership
8862391 i was just taking what was coming my way i dont think i played any different than i have all season
8862392 on a team like the olympic team you dont have to be so aggressive it will just come in terms of scoring it was just whoever got it got it
8862393 i obviously didnt get it as much as the others but thats cool i was more than happy to play my role
8862394 that hasnt stopped me before so im not exactly sure we cant continue to play like this and expect to have a chance to be in the playoffs
8862395 i thought it was the best weve played defensively and weve done a good job all year
8862396 we did some things out there that we didnt even talk about doing it was just great instinctual play by our players
8862397 you see the disappointed looks at preseason games on young guys that havent had many opportunities to play now they get a chance to play this is their game
8862398 so theyre going to be very excited theyre playing for their dream so its very important
8862399 every play you have to play like it is your last in the nfl
8862400 so i am going out taking it serious and leaving no doubt that i belong here and trying to make it a tough decision for them that is my goal for this game go out and make plays and be productive and make no mistakes
8862401 there was no need for more talks since there was a deal already on the table that was waiting to be signed
8862402 it is legitimate for the people of pakistan to ask whether that story is true or not and what is his response because so far neither the government of pakistan nor mr zardari has responded
8862403 i would humbly request him that he should withdraw his candidature in the supreme national interest in the interest of democratic stability and also in the interest of the future prospects of his party
8862404 mr zardari is the pakistan peoples partys unanimous choice and he accepted our request to take the nomination for the position of president
8862405 i would have to start now before having served a day in the senate
8862406 just seeing barack on stage i cried my eyelashes off
8862407 ive never experienced anything like this i think that what he had to offer the country tonight will make us all better
8862408 its one of the most powerful speeches ive ever heard
8862409 it is not a merger investigation and has no specific deadline
8862410 die namen die gestern noch mit h chstem niveau in verbindung gebracht wurden stehen heute doch oftmals f r den zweifel daher ist f r den radsport das heranreifen der n chsten generation besonders wichtig
8862411 wir sind froh ein qualitativ hochwertiges und junges starterfeld zu haben in dem vielleicht der zuk nftige tour de france gewinner vertreten sein wird
8862412 f r mich hat das rennen eine ganz hohe priorit t es ist die rundfahrt in der ich mich vor heimischem publikum zeigen und bestm glich verkaufen will
8862413 es wird darauf ankommen vom start weg voll da zu sein wer auf der ersten etappe von kitzb hel nach hochf gen zeit verliert muss sehr hart k mpfen um diese bis zum kahlen asten vielleicht wieder rein zu holen
8862414 wenn der mann in schwarz pfeift kann der schiedsrichter auch nichts mehr machen
8862415 what they will need to do is access information from all their sources quickly and they will need to check the reliability of their information
8862416 when i quit getting jitters i better quit the business
8862417 i have jitters now and hopefully ill have jitters twenty years from now thats what its all about
8862418 the offensive front even though we lost some players are more familiar with the technique and the things that we want to do in our offensive scheme of things as far as run calls blocking and protection
8862419 but a wins a win we would have liked to do a lot of things better defensively than we did we are in no way satisfied we have to do a lot of things better
8862420 i was trying to make a play for the team but unfortunately it didnt work out that way
8862421 it didnt happen i have to learn from this and try to make better decisions
8862422 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8862423 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8862424 what the people heard people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8862425 im crying because i was around when martin luther king died and when john f kennedy died and its a long time since then and a long time to get back the dream
8862426 this is history i will tell my grandchildren about this
8862427 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8862428 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8862429 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8862430 i worked on the hillary clinton campaign for a year and ive come to the realization that hes the one to change this country
8862431 but lets hope that americans are going to address the problems that are bedeviling the country
8862432 he ingresado voluntariamente en un centro para el tratamiento de la adicci n al sexo
8862433 thought that there was an israeli landing attempt under way and opened fire in the direction of the helicopter hitting it
8862434 pido respeto y privacidad para mi mujer y mis hijos mientras superamos esta situaci n como familia
8862435 it costs our members money and it harms the business but clearly these people who have never had occasion to strike before see this as a last resort
8862436 the union has said quite clearly we remain committed to a negotiated settlement
8862437 on this issue the fact that management have not seen fit to come back to try and negotiate a settlement does not augur well for the future

8862444 but there is a real danger that if everyone thinks that the downturn will be deeper than it needs to be it will become a self fulfilling prophecy
8862445 el resultado es consecuencia del impacto de 20 9 millones de euros que la venta de la filial rusa campomos y sus resultados acumulados hasta junio han tenido en los resultados operativos del grupo consolidado que sin esta aplicaci n se habr an situado en 7 9 millones de euros
8862446 es una operaci n muy buena sin embargo el aplique contable t cnico en la cuenta de resultados lastra la cifra del beneficio neto
8862447 los resultados han sido favorables a pesar del contexto de encarecimiento de las materias primas en los ltimos meses
8862448 we want politicians to notice college students and pay attention to issues we care about
8862449 the participants underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people and for efforts aimed at preserving the unity of the state and its territorial integrity
8862450 it wasnt what i would call an endorsement of russias recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia
8862451 are not satisfied that this courts intervention by way of extraordinary writ is warranted at this time
8862452 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8862453 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8862454 i dont know how but he somehow managed to verbalize his passion for his job and for his country
8862455 wow this is going to be the future of the democratic party
8862456 the convention could not be held in a more beautiful state in my opinion the best state in the union
8862457 id have to say this is one of the most defining moments in my life listening to obama speak just really encouraged me to do good not only for others but for the good of the nation
8862458 i just feel so very privileged to have gotten a ticket and to be here at the dnc
8862459 there are people here from all over the country and the amount of diversity is just incredible i just cant believe it
8862460 this project has been in development for many many years
8862461 there was literally wiring and asbestos hanging from the ceilings when we had to stop construction and basically seal off the building
8862462 i dont remember anything up until my head hit the window
8862463 when i get a feeling or an impulse i go with it
8862464 dispersal of blacks into districts in which they constitute an ineffective minority of voters
8862465 it is essential that each person obeys the laws while riding a bicycle or driving a vehicle on campus
8862466 the csu police department encourages the use of efficient green methods of transportation such as walking bicylcling or skateboarding
8862467 most of the people i see are walking their bike
8862468 if i think i can get away with it i dont always follow bike laws
8862469 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8862470 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8862471 were pleased with the ranking among americas top universities but of course were not satisfied with this ranking and we hope to continue to improve in future years
8862472 its also useful to note that were not alone in our investments toward quality our peers are taking similar approaches and so were pleased with our position despite much greater state support and tuition increases by our peers
8862473 were very pleased but more important than ranking is to improve each year
8862474 were less concerned with rankings than excellence were concerned more with great educational programs and research and the rankings reflect that
8862475 we anticipate increasing faculty size increasing employee salaries and benefits increasing need and merit based financial aid increasing student success rates in retention and graduation increasing research and enrollment based funding and a general recognition that colorado state university is a university making serious positive progress
8862476 we can relax now but please be cautious they might return soon
8862477 we are staging a protest because the government has made too many mistakes and has no legitimacy to run the country
8862478 from now on it will be stickier our political rallying will get stronger because more of our supporters from upcountry will come to help us we will not back down
8862479 we can withstand any difficult conditions if we can topple samak
8862480 if you leave the government house that means we have been defeated
8862481 they want the military to come out and do the coup again
8862482 al lami was a moderate official and we are surprised by his arrest
8862483 the man has been known to travel in and out of iraq to neighboring nations including iran and lebanon where it is believed he meets and helps run the iranian backed special groups in iraq
8862484 fighting and confronting saddams regime despite the risks that surrounded him
8862485 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8862486 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8862487 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8862488 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8862489 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two
8862490 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8862491 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8862492 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8862493 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8862494 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8862495 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8862496 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8862497 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8862498 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8862499 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8862500 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8862501 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8862502 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8862503 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8862504 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8862505 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8862506 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8862507 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8862508 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8862509 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8862510 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8862511 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8862512 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8862513 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8862514 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8862515 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8862516 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8862517 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8862518 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8862519 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8862520 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8862521 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8862522 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8862523 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8862524 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8862525 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8862526 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8862527 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8862528 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8862529 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8862530 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8862531 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8862532 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8862533 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8862534 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8862535 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8862536 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8862537 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8862538 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8862539 there will of course be exceptions and the ombudsman is considering very carefully what these might be
8862540 it is pleasing that the ombudsman issued no reports against us but we must continue to strive to improve services and in particular the time we take to respond to ombudsman investigations
8862541 already we have invested significantly in areas of service that generate a significant proportion of complaints and work is under way to identify and tackle features of complaints in particular how we can ensure that we identify and respond in a timely manner to complaints what is most important is that we can demonstrate that we are learning from complaints and using that learning to improve services
8862542 all flights have been cancelled and passengers are being advised to seek bookings with alternative airlines
8862543 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to suspend all zoom operations it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8862544 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8862545 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying even late today we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8862546 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8862547 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8862548 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8862549 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8862550 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8862551 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8862552 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8862553 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8862554 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8862555 have to stop using them as lodging houses and the students will have to find alternate accommodation
8862556 on monday all the employees were contacted and told they could return to work or take an unpaid leave they are working on a variety of sanitization and cleaning efforts
8862557 people may wish to consider covering not just their mortgage debt but their family expenditure and bills
8862558 most families would really struggle if there was an unexpected drop in the household income
8862559 theyd pack a scandal in every scene if they could
8862560 as far as the way the kids are acting teenagers are teenagers being a teen is universal thats why the appeal of the show is so universal as cool as they may feel theyre still 16 17
8862561 everyone likes to think that its hot and romantic its not because you have guys standing around with mikes
8862562 when were doing love scenes it never gets easy but it gets funnier because youre doing it on the show with people who are your best friends
8862563 i am on cloud nine and i dont know now if i am ever going to come down
8862564 i have a good friend of mine who is a musician and i have a lot of clients who are musicians and i see them going through changes
8862565 it is the closest thing to a rock star for me so i correlated my story from that
8862566 just seeing my mom walk through those doors it felt like home
8862567 just having her by my side i felt i would do well
8862568 if you look at the show it was charlie doing that same birds nest over and over and he didnt get called out for it
8862569 so i was wondering if there was a little favoritism on judge kim vo s side for charlie kim didnt give me much recognition
8862570 there has been so much build up for this season i think we will have a very competitive team this season and i really think that we play much better when we can build off the crowd in moby
8862571 i just hope that anyone out there who hasnt been to a game will come because i think they will like what they see
8862572 we have tried as a team to keep putting our focus on taking it one game at a time we dont want to get caught up in any of the hype it is important for us to stay focused
8862573 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back

8862575 the vast majority of the problems on file with the ministry had to do with the landlords not keeping up with the leasehold improvements required of them
8862576 childrens corner daycare has gone above and beyond what can be expected of a tenant in order to try and keep their licence in good standing
8862577 this guy has done everything that has been asked of him and more and yet the city and the province have made it impossible for him
8862578 he has been borrowing from friends and family to keep up the business and now hes going to have to sell his townhouse
8862579 this definitely had nothing to do with the quality of the program
8862580 the staff were doing an exemplary job theyd done an awful lot with very little in fact they had really brought up the quality of the program
8862581 this centre has been part of my childs life since she was 18 months old
8862582 the teachers the cook they are like family to us they really care about the children
8862583 its a very right wing government yet it wants to pass itself off as being moderate
8862584 this is not a time to go back to trudeau style economic policies it is not a time to impose new taxes on the canadian economy and it is not a time to launch big unfunded spending initiatives
8862585 he is certainly the liberal leader that has taken his party farthest to the left at least since mr trudeau if not farther than mr trudeau
8862586 until canadians could find out more about what this government is all about they have been trying to hide their real agenda
8862587 we can see with these cuts what theyre really all about theyre attacking the freedom of arts and culture here
8862588 you told us that we were going to be able to break our leases without penalty without hesitation
8862589 thats been our position since the first 48 hours after the explosion
8862590 we are having nightmares every night we are scared to go back in
8862591 im going to tell him that if you want to quit your job im going to apply for it
8862592 i think the fix is in i think hes going through a charade here
8862593 all the signs indicate that this parliament is at the end of its productiveness
8862594 this review is focused on going forward to make sure these kinds of incidents dont happen again
8862595 were going to make sure that all the recommendations are implemented and that our standards are current and they are the best
8862596 we cant afford to shelve propane safety for another 20 years because the risk to public safety is too high
8862597 the government must dismantle the tssa and bring the responsibility for inspections back into government directly
8862598 its become obvious that a catastrophe has to happen before the technology can move forward
8862599 if we have a substantial amount of food irradiated we will have substantial fewer illnesses
8862600 that doesnt mean anyone is going to use it but its a necessary first step
8862601 theres a whole lot of noise around the issue but the focus here is do we have technologies that lead to fewer sick people there is way too much food borne illness and people get sick and die if there are tools to help reduce those numbers we need to explore them
8862602 we do have some foods that are currently allowed to be irradiated such as wheat spices potatoes and onions
8862603 you dont want to use irradiation to treat bad food youve got to use it sensibly in combination with food manufacturing practices
8862604 i think realistically the better applications would be for irradiation of things like raw meats to inactivate e coli
8862605 schools are going to need some time at the beginning of the year to get to this its a busy time and high schools with pools will have to redo their timetables because when they set them before the summer they thought the pools would be closed
8862606 so people will have to be a little patient it will probably be early october before swim classes are up and running but then again we have 472 schools that dont have pools
8862607 realistically there are going to be a number of children who arrive at school next week who think the schools pools are open but theyll find the doors closed
8862608 income is actually a much better metric for happiness than we ever thought it was
8862609 the dodge van struck the city officer pinning him between his patrol car and the van
8862610 then the subject they were chasing jumped into the van and got away
8862611 they were working together when the guy from the intrepid got out and ran the city copper almost has him in custody then comes the van and hits the officer and his buddy gets in the van
8862612 my belief they were working together they probably started working in one car
8862613 theres also chop shops in the area where they sell the rims pull out the car stereos a lot of times they just ride them around until they run out of gas and steal another car
8862614 a lot of people complain that we get in vehicle pursuits but if someone goes to that extreme to ram a policeman to free someone else why would they go to that extreme just for some petty crime there must be something more serious involved
8862615 this is yet another reminder of just how dangerous the job of a police officer can be and yet another reminder that officers are putting their lives on the line everyday trying to look out for all of us were hopeful that whoever was in that van will be caught

8862619 i dont anticipate being very nervous for some reason i can see that clearly
8862620 i was nervous last january i was nervous for spring ball i was nervous when we started in august and i told the football team that the outcomes decided then when we roll down there sunday all that hard work and all their hard work well find out where we stand as programs at that point but most of whats going to happen has to do with how we trained this offseason
8862621 i cant wait its going to be a blast its an opportunity for me as a true freshman to go out and have fun
8862622 youre as nervous as you make yourself anxious more so than nervous you get nervous because you dont know how youre going to perform having some nerve is good but being overly nervous is bad im just anxious
8862623 its pretty pressure packed no matter who you open up with
8862624 thats the nature of division one football im just looking at it as we came here to do a job and this is the road we have to travel
8862625 we relish the chance anytime that you get to play your in state rival whether its the first game of the season or the twelfth
8862626 well have a good plan for the buffaloes and well be ready to go
8862627 most the guys on this staff are familiar with this game so we know what its about and its a great atmosphere
8862628 its a little easier to visualize the game when you have been there and know what you are walking into

8862633 its an opportunity to see guys racing and get an idea of how everyone does in competition
8862634 we had quite a few new faces at team camp and practices
8862635 we have good chemistry and good group of guys this year
8862636 we have the most talented team weve ever had but we also have the youngest team too
8862637 it was good to have everyone together and encouraging to see the team come together quickly
8862638 we have great team potential a lot of new people and good returning leaders
8862639 i dont really feel pressure i just use the gifts given to me and to do my best for the team
8862640 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8862641 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8862642 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8862643 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8862644 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8862645 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8862646 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8862647 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8862648 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8862649 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8862650 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8862651 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8862652 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8862653 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8862654 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8862655 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8862656 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8862657 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8862658 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8862659 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8862660 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8862661 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8862662 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8862663 last night we were up all night drinking whiskey sours and singing folk songs
8862664 i need a moment to catch my breath and try to get my life back together
8862665 i watched her all week she was being tortured every day
8862666 i told her she gave me my son back it was something i needed to say
8862667 i think you dont know what goes on in combat until you are in combat
8862668 i dont think they are going to put on a case in the future with a lack of evidence
8862669 the gcse is a well established qualification understood and valued by young people parents and employers
8862670 these new gcses will ensure that all young people are able to demonstrate their skills knowledge and understanding when studying for a qualification that meets their individual needs
8862671 as these new qualifications are introduced i want to reassure students teachers employers and the public that ofqual will ensure that the gcse standard is maintained it is vital that young people who work so hard to gain valuable qualifications get fair reliable and consistent results
8862672 there has been too much regulation and qualifications by committee and as a result gcses had become very stale and mechanical in their style thankfully gcse development has become less about government diktat and more about speaking and listening to teachers
8862673 transforming gcses in line with the revised criteria was no easy task but we were mindful of the fact that whatever we did would have a profound affect on the futures of thousands of young people and consulting with teachers was critical to this process
8862674 the new specifications that have been put before the qca for accreditation are more relevant to todays society allowing teachers to develop the skills in young people needed to prepare them for employment or further education
8862675 aqa is proud of the range of gcses we provide as well as the excellent personal support and value for money we offer to schools
8862676 through our partnerships with teachers and students we have created an excellent range of gcses in doing so we have recognised that each subject has its own unique requirements that are reflected in our new specifications
8862677 our new gcses have engaging and accessible content for all levels of ability and will enable students to realise their full potential
8862678 modules are likely to give a further boost to the results because young people will take the exams in small bites and be able to repeat modules

8862681 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8862682 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8862683 hey heres my take on this post check it out here
8862684 no fun is to share his stage with hundreds of fans
8862685 we continue to expect arrears and repossessions to increase for the remainder of the year
8862686 in terms of lending the main area of focus remains buy to let where tenant demand remains strong and rents are rising
8862687 however we plan to reduce mortgage volumes in the second half and into 2009 until more favourable economic conditions return
8862688 i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring obama said
8862689 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8862690 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8862691 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8862692 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8862693 i could not help thinking how proud my father would be said martin luther king iii
8862694 we are making a major down payment on the fulfillment of that dream he said
8862695 preacher from georgia on that washington night 45 years ago
8862696 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead obama said
8862697 a change will do us good stevie wonder a long time obama supporter performed
8862698 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less obama said
8862699 more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet
8862700 more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8862701 but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush obama said
8862702 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day mccain said
8862703 chasing the championship with this many points between us is maybe possible with other riders but with valentino it s nearly impossible

8862716 i wanted to play three sports football basketball and track this is my last chance
8862717 but i didnt have anything to do with anthony leaving i came because anthony left
8862718 the kids are starting to buy in and join forces kyle north has been showing a lot of leadership
8862719 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8862720 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring
8862721 what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8862722 i cannot help but feel how proud my father would be proud of barack obama proud of the party that nominated him
8862723 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8862724 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8862725 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8862726 on the granular level he stuck it to mccain and he also answered critics who have said he is too soaring and not specific
8862727 i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8862728 i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8862729 dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy
8862730 obviously are worried about putting their proposal out because they know it would not be good
8862731 were the minority party its not our responsibility to produce a budget
8862732 if were here for another couple weeks well have to do something

8862743 if a player is on the market that fits our ideas we always have the possibility to sign him
8862744 were clever enough to know that the current table is not showing the true strengths of the teams
8862745 only two matches have been played but we still want to improve
8862746 i think the work being done is necessary it is important and i think already that it is starting to bear some fruit
8862747 but the real benefits will come with changes to the format of the competition we will be abolishing the uefa intertoto cup which has now completed its last ever phase and we will have a new format with a group stage very much mirroring the champions league in the seasons to come
8862748 we will also be having a centralised marketing concept for the group stage of the uefa cup which should provide a stronger presence in the market and more revenue which we all feel is very important
8862749 we will be working to enhance the competitions appeal over the coming years

8862753 i try to tune to a trumpet if you ever go to horse races and you hear that guy on the trumpet
8862754 i dont like any ring i like it to sound like a 10 guage shotgun give him a beefy fat sound without having any ring or having it sound like a tin can in any way
8862755 if he ever breaks stuff throws the drums off the stage anything like that then i know he had a great show
8862756 other drummers they destroy it because theyre pissed john if he destroys something he had a good night he gets the aggression out on the drums

8862774 there is still a great deal of uncertainty but the bank of englands forecasts of growth and inflation have been widely interpreted as opening the door to rate cuts
8862775 we expect the next move in the bank of england base rate to be down but the extent to which this will revive the mortgage and housing market is likely to be limited while overall confidence in economic and housing market conditions is low
8862776 the risks to our forecast of a 15 decline in house prices over the course of 2008 and 2009 are now squarely to the downside we continue to expect the bank of england to cut rates before the end of the year

8862782 im crying because i was around when martin luther king died and when john f kennedy died and its a long time since then and a long time to get back the dream
8862783 this is history i will tell my grandchildren about this
8862784 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8862785 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8862786 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8862787 i worked on the hillary clinton campaign for a year and ive come to the realization that hes the one to change this country
8862788 but lets hope that americans are going to address the problems that are bedeviling the country

8862798 the new generation of retirees are bucking tradition and no longer believe their children have an automatic right to inheritance
8862799 they are using the money from equity release to enjoy their retirement
8862800 although most retired homeowners have seen the value of equity in their homes fall in recent months its important that they dont lose sight of the bigger picture which is that despite current falling property prices in the vast majority of cases retired homeowners have built up a significant amount of equity in their homes over a number of years

8862806 it was just like ive been trying to do since i got out here to go out there and do what ive been coached to do
8862807 we made the check and chad made a great catch the line picked up an all out blitz its pretty fun when it goes as planned like that
8862808 we were down and trying to make a comeback with the second team offense in we were pushing up and down the field and it was a good touchdown drive oconnell saw a different coverage at the line of scrimmage and changed the play and i went up and made the play
8862809 we had an option on the play based on a look that they gave us
8862810 and kevin did a nice job on that he made a good throw and chad ran a good route he stacked the corner and kevin threw it up there to give him a chance to get it
8862811 its not something i could have done probably three weeks ago
8862812 any time the defense is trying to get you they have an all out blitz called you get the check like that and your wideout makes a great play in the corner of the end zone thats a pretty good feeling
8862813 theyre both exciting just to get points on the board
8862814 enough might not be enough so well see what happens over the next couple of days
8862815 youre gonna like the way you look i guarantee it

8862817 despite the global downturn flattening the growth of personal debt and uk gdp over the past few quarters debt levels continue to grow at a faster rate than the income the uk generates
8862818 although there is no cause for panic as personal debt is well covered by the uk housing stock the figures clearly illustrate the continuing problem of growing personal debt levels in the uk if the property market and economy continue to weaken the current levels of personal debt will become unsustainable and there will be a marked increase in personal insolvencies

8862820 cell phone manufacturers aim to distinguish themselves from their competition with increasingly complex features and unique interfaces yet consumers over 30 have this frustrating sense of enough already
8862821 that demographic wants features that are easily accessible not lost in multiple levels of menus within menus they want large fonts they can read and they want a simpler button setup so theyre not so confused about what theyre doing hitting keys by accident etc
8862822 i never quite know what im doing after a year and a half
8862823 if its too complicated it just really isnt worth it
8862824 to this day i dont know how to check voicemail
8862825 i wish i had started this stuff five years earlier id be making bank
8862826 but hindsite is always 20 20 and im 100 percent certain there is still lots of money to be made last year alone domain sales for casino computer programmer volunteers companies topped 10 million dollars which tallied up to be a record setting year
8862827 this is good news for all those in the casino computer programmer volunteers marketing business
8862828 and the fact that internet related marketing only diminishes in cost over time means that soon original domain name purchases will be dirt cheap
8862829 with the power of the search engines these days its not the end of the world if you dont get a glitzy domain name just seo your site to the best of your abilities and slowly but surely people will beging to remember your sites presence on the internet when making casino computer programmer volunteers related buying decisions
8862830 we got stuck with a co uk version of the domain we wanted
8862831 but we played it to our advantage by marketing heavily to those in the uk and beefing up local seo in great britain the results show for themselves we had record breaking profits last quarter
8862832 one of the most amazing casino computer programmer volunteers related sales we had was in last septembers auction
8862833 though the domain didnt go for much money bidding was very spirited with some 50 people getting in on the action in the end the casino computer programmer volunteers domain went to a well established marketing firm who did not disclose their future plans for it
8862834 were getting all the gold we can find and turning it into diamonds
8862835 weve heard of other businesses temporarily loosing their domain name to hackers
8862836 but after a couple days the name is recovered and doubly secured by the respective company at their domain name registar
8862837 if you buy brake porcelli com youre the only one who can have that address it is entirely unique and therefore by virtue of its rarity it immediately can accrue value you may find that you get tons of email offers for your domain name this will allow you to sort out whos serious and whos just fooling around and then after youve found a good casino computer programmer volunteers industry buyer youll surely make some great profits

8862867 this also has the benefit of allowing migr s the opportunity to decide which area of the new country they want to live in prior to making a commitment to purchase also if for some reason things dont work out as expected and migr s want to return home it is simpler to return to the uk and avoid all the purchase costs such as stamp duty and estate agents costs of buying a new home
8862868 for a rented property to pay for itself then migr s need to secure a rental income of at least 1 25 times the mortgage payments however some deals allow as little as 1 1 times they should also change from a residential to a buy to let mortgage which is fairly straightforward as long as you have 25 per cent equity in the property although some lenders will allow as little as 15 per cent on some products

8862935 on numerous occasions winston peters has promised to clear these matters up

8862955 people should believe i am innocent because i have gone through my whole life trying to be as fair and considerate to other people as i possibly could i do not have a violent bone in my body and to take a life i would have thought would be the ultimate form of aggression
8862956 i just know in my heart that one day my innocence will be proved and i will be able to go home to try and rebuild my life wherever that home may be
8862957 at this moment in time i feel very confident about my appeal but for obvious reasons i cannot go into detail
8862958 what i would say to the people of suffolk is be on your guard because the real killer is still out there although the injustice that has been done to me i feel no malice or contempt for the people of suffolk and for the families of the five girls that were cruelly taken away from them i feel sorrow and heartfelt pain for their loss with me being arrested for these crimes it gave them someone to vent their anger at to which i completely understand but believe me when i say he is still out there contemplating his next move
8862959 i did expect to be found not guilty when the verdict came in it was like knives going into my heart my thoughts were this cannot be happening they have made a mistake have i stepped into the wrong court room they cannot be talking about me it just did not seem real
8862960 obviously the day i was convicted i was just numb with shock and kept thinking that i was in a dream or nightmare and i would wake up soon but i am bearing up pretty well at the moment even though nearly two years of my life have been taken away from me i always try to look on the positive side of things just knowing the truth will set me free
8862961 the evidence against me started with my dna being on three of the girls for which i did not deny my contact with said girls also many others which was what the police built their case around all their evidence proved was that i had contact with said girls but not one shred of evidence showed that i killed them
8862962 i suppose being on the vp vulnerable prisoner wing every prisoner has their own problems to deal with so everyone more or less keeps themselves to themselves i have always been a private person so i tend to seclude myself from any conversations or interacting with other prisoners

8862966 the plan is to consult with court managers to determine in each court what is the best way we can achieve the savings we need while having the least impact on public access to the courts
8862967 the kinds of questions were asking are should all the courts be closed the same half day each week does it make sense to have some courts closed at different times were pretty much into that kind of micro planning at the moment
8862968 its definitely not going to be to anybodys advantage to close it everything will just get backed up i dont think its such a good idea

8862980 he is keenly aware that he has created pain and caused shame and he is tormented by that

8862984 we recognise that establishing a productive working relationship with suzhou will be mutually beneficial for both regions
8862985 during our visit well be examining the possibility of working very closely on four key areas education trade culture and tourism and port related activity
8862986 if you take education as just one example our schools have already recognised the significance of china they are involved in significant initiatives to enable students to capitalise on the opportunities that china is likely to generate in the future
8862987 for example calday grange grammar school has been awarded a prestigious role in the development of mandarin teaching through the specialist schools and academies trust and has been chosen to be the
8862988 and schools are just one example of how we in wirral are positively engaging with china in addition we are keen to progress discussions with peel holdings to deliver a significant link between businesses in suzhou and the wirral waters project
8862989 the government of suzhou has expressed a strong desire to establish formal links with wirral and i am confident this visit will be the start of a relationship that will deliver significant benefits to the children and businesses of wirral
8862990 the significance of this potential relationship cannot be under estimated i have been impressed already by the commitment shown by both wirral council and the government of suzhou
8862991 our ambition for wirral waters is to deliver a truly world class waterfront and the significant interest already shown by china must be capitalised upon to help us achieve that
8862992 we are proud to once again be associated with this prestigious initiative and to be involved in recognising key women players in the film industry one has only to look at the inspiration that people such as kgomotso and the two other finalists joyce sikhakhane rankin of xoxa productions and desiree markgraaff of bomb shelter production provide to our youth to women and to our industry in general to realise the value of their contribution to all facets of our lives
8862993 ucc music video contest for breaking up in the daylight was the one who produced the music video
8862994 on december 2007 we held a contest called the breaking up in daylight music video challenge where the winner got an award and was given the chance to produce an all expense paid music video for one of the artist signed under jype
8862995 the contestant who grabbed our attention was kim eui yun who eventually won the contest and was invited to produce the music video for this time which is thought of as wonder girls second title track after so hot
8862996 the music video is about the wonder girls members reading a book titled this time a complicated love story between a designer and a mannequin
8862997 this time is a bright ballad song so we decided to reflect the mood of the song by using only soft colors in the video
8862998 im still an amateur but i want to thank jype for giving me the chance to debut as a music video director and making my dreams come true
8862999 the customer subscribes to the service and accesses the software and the relevant data online which is hosted at the valgen secure data centre as valgn es

8863004 my wife sian and i are devastated that our beautiful daughter michelle died as a result of this incident
8863005 we want to know why the lifeguards at the pool appear not to have noticed that michelle was drowning despite the fact the pool was not busy at the time
8863006 we also want to know why the staff at the leisure centre failed to report in the first emergency call that it was a drowning incident and said michelle was ok and conscious when in fact she required emergency resuscitation
8863007 as a result emergency medical help was delayed which may have lost the chance to save her life
8863008 it is essential that lessons are learned so this does not happen to anyone else
8863009 michelles parents want a full and independent investigation into this incident carried out
8863010 we have asked the hse to review their decision only to investigate the involvement of the council we would like them also to investigate the involvement of leisure connection limited there are questions to ask about the lifeguarding and handling of the emergency response
8863011 how can maldon district council conduct a proper investigation if it also may have contributed to what has happened here if on review the decision is not changed we reserve the right to challenge the decision by seeking judicial review if necessary
8863012 the roles are pretty clearly set out in the legislation
8863013 we have been waiting for over 10 years for this day its a dream come true for the surfing community of bournemouth
8863014 the reef will turn an unrideable knee high wave into a head high wave that peels perfectly for around 70 metres in length
8863015 the weather has had quite a big impact usually its nice and flat but this year has been quite different with 15 knot winds every day sometimes stronger up to 40 knots with big seas and surf
8863016 we need a bit of a weather window to put down the reef and start filling that section we want to fill a third of the bags fairly quickly so its fairly secure down there
8863017 i think its important for me as a representative of those citizens to promote birmingham to their countries of cultural origin
8863018 i believe that my official visit to pakistan and bangladesh will be an opportunity to raise international awareness of the social cultural and economic contribution that has been made by pakistani indian and bangladeshi immigrants to the uk as a whole
8863019 the message i will take with me is that birmingham is a great place to live we also want to encourage people from around the world to visit us and for foreign businesses to invest in the profitable opportunities birmingham has to offer
8863020 im very proud that chauhdry rashid who has served as my local councillor for more than 20 years has been given the honour of representing our fair city to the wider world
8863021 his planned tour of the indian sub continent is a wonderful show of respect to communities that have been integral to birminghams economic success and im sure that he will be welcomed with open arms by the residents of sylhet dhaka the punjab and azad kashmir
8863022 imagine don mclean growing up in cleveland in the 70s and if he was black with a little bit of cat stevens twisted into his words and a little bit of richie havens thats the thought behind it
8863023 im more latin jazz orchestral folk its a lot of big sounds all live instruments
8863024 i remember telling them if youre not going to let me produce it myself then heres your advance back
8863025 i had made a little bit of money i was going to do it myself
8863026 it is simply outrageous that this mountain of information was not better protected and it is equally outrageous that we are hearing about a possible six million additional individuals and businesses six months after the fact
8863027 we fear a substantial number connecticut residents are among this latest group had the hundreds of thousands of connecticut residents affected been notified immediately that their data had been compromised they could have taken steps to protect themselves
8863028 nothing in the data we were given in may and june by bny mellon indicated in any way that these additional six million individuals and businesses were involved
8863029 this certainly raises serious additional questions about how secure personal identifying data is at the bank of new york mellon and widens the scope of our investigation
8863030 its early in the campaign season and in the end the vote on this measure could be hard to predict
8863031 the burden is always on the yes side to convince people there is good reason to vote for the measure
8863032 for america the magic is over it will never be as it was before

8863035 ich m chte zun chst michael kenan und roy cohen f r die von ihnen f r wizcom geleistet arbeit danken und ihnen gleichzeitig alles gute f r die zukunft w nschen zu meinen wichtigsten aufgaben als ceo wird der abschluss des turnaround programms die weiterentwicklung unserer vertriebskan le sowie die vorbereitung des eintritts in neue m rkte sein wir sehen erste positive resultate es ist jedoch noch zu fr h um hierzu detaillierte informationen ver ffentlichen zu k nnen
8863036 obwohl wir einen verlust und einen erheblichen umsatzr ckgang ver ffentlicht haben beginnen wir erste ergebnisse unserer turnaround strategie zu sp ren mit dem aktuellen auftragseingang aus unserer bestehenden kundenbasis gehen wir davon aus den umsatzr ckgang bis zum jahresende reduzieren zu k nnen f r das gesamtjahr erwarten wir einen umsatz von rund 8 5 mio us dollar dar ber hinaus haben wir die technischen probleme bei unserem produkt der dritten generation behoben und zum beginn des dritten quartals wieder mit der auslieferung nach china begonnen hierdurch sowie aufgrund der implementierten kostensenkungsma nahmen glauben wir in den bereich der profitabilit t zur ckkehren zu k nnen
8863037 in sachen liquidit t erwarten wir obwohl wir innerhalb der letzten sechs monate einen r ckgang der finanziellen mittel hinnehmen mussten dass wir im zweiten halbjahr einen positiven cash flow erwirtschaften k nnen dennoch bewerten wir parallel die m glichkeiten zur st rkung unserer bilanz die ernennung von yulia omari zum vp finance wird auf der operativen seite f r einen reibungslosen bergang sorgen da sie bereits seit sommer 2007 im unternehmen arbeitet

8863042 mr peters has offered to step aside obviously ive accepted that offer and i in the meantime assume the portfolios he holds
8863043 it is to be hoped that the sfo will address there matters expeditiously
8863044 series stacking will really make the unmissable unmissable viewers will be able to join a series half way through following a friends recommendation and catch up on all the previous episodes or watch them all in one go over a weekend
8863045 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8863046 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8863047 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8863048 john mccain has voted with george bush ninety per cent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety per cent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten per cent chance on change
8863049 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8863050 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8863051 i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8863052 a decision is expected that she will remove him from office and we could expect it by next friday i believe we are in the last two weeks of mayor kilpatricks term
8863053 if the governor removes him from office his biggest bargaining chip has been removed with that gone the wheels move forward and if he doesnt get a plea deal done before the governor makes her decision then i think jail time will definitely be a part of what happens after that
8863054 i think she might get a mild uptick from a lot of people who will be relieved that someone has finally gotten rid of kwame but i think there is also going to be a lot of backlash
8863055 i think there will be some intensity of anger at her by a lot of african americans in detroit who dont love kwame kilpatrick but they are going to resent a white woman up in lansing kicking out their mayor whom they elected when he literally has never been convicted of anything
8863056 but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8863057 had it not been for that i have a dream speech
8863058 i very likely wouldnt be standing in invesco field to accept the nomination from my party
8863059 mr obama is nowhere man when it comes time to speak out on reforming big city public schools with their criminally high dropout rates for minority children
8863060 he apparently refuses to do it for fear that supporting vouchers or doing anything to strengthen charter schools will alienate vote rich unions his rare references to the critical argument over affirmative action an issue on several state ballots this fall give both opponents and supporters reason to think he might be on their side he has had little if anything to say about the persistent 25 percent poverty rate in black america
8863061 after securing the nomination in june sen barack obamas first priority had to be healing the rift between himself and hillary clinton
8863062 the reason rsls are required to seek consent is to ensure that there is no improper use of the property and to protect public funds the application for consent may also alert the housing corporation to regulatory problems
8863063 the corporation will normally give consent but care should be taken to ensure that the disposal is not less than the market value or contrary to the rsls objects and or permissible purposes
8863064 under section 36 of the charities act 1993 sub section 9 allows a disposal of land for which general or special authority is expressly given in an act of parliament
8863065 charities thinking of disposing to a subsidiary should be aware of this point since section 36 would on the face of it allow the matter to proceed with only consent from the housing corporation in fact consent will probably be required from the charity commission as well this should not be too problematic since it is possible to obtain an application form from the charity commission website although there is extra work involved if this application is completed at the same time as the application to the housing corporation then that would be an efficient use of time so as to achieve compliance

8863073 the court finds that the ordinance as written is too ambiguous to be enforceable
8863074 we feel this ordinance regulates quality of life issues which are of ultimate importance to residents in our unincorporated areas
8863075 our intent was not to put any catering trucks out of business but to ensure fairness to our residents
8863076 if you cant manage your restaurant business in a way so that you can compete with a taco truck maybe you should find another business
8863077 this law hurt us it favors some businesses over others and makes a hardworking person into a delinquent

8863147 we deserve better than john mccains jokes about bombing iran or his denials that iraq has distracted us from afghanistan

8863149 for eight long years weve had a president who rushed to stand with soldiers at political rallies but abandoned them at walter reed weve had a president who spent billions on private contractors but not on body armor for all our troops
8863150 for the past eight years the man in the oval office has tipped his hat over his eyes kicked back his chair and snoozed at his desk while his vice president conspired with oil industry cronies
8863151 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do

8863161 it just touched your heart to see how people would go to this goodwill business school and it would turn their lives around
8863162 the image that we have with a large number of people is that we are in the business of running thrift stores
8863163 that is not our business that is a means to an end
8863164 the economy clearly plays a tremendous role in what goodwill does
8863165 where else can you learn what it takes to get a job
8863166 goodwill provided the tools necessary for me to become gainfully employed i ended up getting a really good job
8863167 i want people to understand goodwill isnt just about donating clothes
8863168 they see that but i dont think they see where the money goes

8863307 i think its a stressful time for a lot of people but i know that ive worked hard and played hard now we cant control what decisions are made
8863308 you get the check and the wideout makes a great play in the corner of the end zone thats a pretty good feeling
8863309 its exciting to just put points on the board thats my main goal going in there and this whole preseason thats how its been
8863310 we were planning on winning the game if we got the ball back
8863311 weve had bad records in preseason what counts is how you play in the regular season thats what matters
8863312 i think really we wanted to see matt cassel play and tom wouldnt have played very much in this game anyway
8863313 we wanted to see how matt played and we wanted to see how gutierrez and kevin play and thats what we got
8863314 yeah it was good to have all the players that were able to participate
8863315 it was good for matt to get a few snaps i dont think its monumental or anything but its good to have them all out there
8863316 i feel like i picked up where i left off with the first game i just have to wait and see what happens and hopefully im getting ready for kansas city

8863364 he controls the game really well with the bat in hand
8863365 i wouldnt say there are a lot of concerns but there were things we didnt do well here that cost us the test series

8863380 i am confident that this year too we will be more or less correct on our assessment of gdp growth and the economy will grow close to eight per cent

8863400 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring
8863401 what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8863402 i cannot help but feel how proud my father would be proud of barack obama proud of the party that nominated him
8863403 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8863404 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8863405 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8863406 on the granular level he stuck it to mccain and he also answered critics who have said he is too soaring and not specific
8863407 i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8863408 i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8863409 dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy
8863410 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8863411 how perfect that your nomination acceptance would come on this historic day
8863412 the backdrop is about exactly what president bush used in 2004
8863413 tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8863414 they claim that our insistence on something larger something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values
8863415 if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from you make a big election about small things

8863419 there is no room for flexibility on the issue of the judiciary there was no room for flexibility on the impeachment of the president there is no room for flexibility on something that we have signed together something on which we have given a solemn pledge to each other when you have an agenda to strengthen democracy and make the parliament sovereign how can you be flexible

8863424 conversion of pfcs remains a challenge and our research efforts are directed at designing even more active catalysts capable of pfc activation
8863425 die besonderen f higkeiten und die herausragende pers nlichkeit des hedgefonds managers gehen weit ber die eigentlichen fachkenntnisse hinaus neben f hrungsf higkeiten muss ein hedgefonds manager eine interessante mischung von f higkeiten haben er braucht vitalit t aggressivit t und ein gutes beurteilungsverm gen schlie lich muss ein erfolgreicher investment manager die neuesten ideen und moden erkennen noch bevor jeder andere sie erkennt und auf den zug aufspringt

8863427 this is senator mccains decision and his announcement and we all want to be respectful of his desire to have the chance to announce it himself
8863428 i know that everton are a big club who have a history of playing in important competitions like the uefa cup
8863429 i hope i can do my best for the team
8863430 he has been fantastic here and it is a bit of a shame but it is the players wish and we wish him good luck
8863431 its good i have a connection to charlton and im also going to be close to my family
8863432 its a great opportunity for me to play football at a high standard with a club who have ambitions
8863433 robinho still has two years left on his contract that being the case he is our player for the next two seasons so you can draw your own conclusions from that
8863434 he is a fantastic player i saw a lot of him last season watching the spanish games he had a very good season until he got injured and it broke his season up a bit
8863435 he has great flair and something that would be nice to bring into our team we have flair players already but he is another option and he could light up the league he will have to get used to it because it is different to spain but he showed he is a world class player both at madrid and for brazil and world class players adapt
8863436 it was roman abramovich who bought shaun and mourinho did not rate him
8863437 i am appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time of the murder to please contact police with any information you may have
8863438 the incident happened close to a well lit bus garage
8863439 did you see several males in the grass area near to the bus garage and close to selborne walk shopping centre did you see anyone run away from the scene
8863440 i like the way he handles a broad range of subjects in an engaging and friendly manner definitely one of the good guys
8863441 right wing blogging from a uk student a fresh perspective on a plethora of events with a healthy interest in shelf stacking to boot
8863442 one of the more depressing aspects of blogging and the modern world is seeing reams of text on a page the thunder dragons mixture of politics and fun posts with good illustrations and quickly made points makes his blog an accessible and fun place to discuss and think about politics the thunderdragon is one of the rising stars of conservative blogging
8863443 already an a lister technical whiz thunder dragon shows that not all a listers are stuck up stats groupies whod sell their grandmothers for more traffic and hes on iain dales list for a reason hes simply a fine blogger scoring highly on the ten point dale criteria and with his finger always on the political pulse hes also the technical brains behind blogpower along with ian at imagined community
8863444 the thunderdragon consistently provides an interesting and enjoyable read always entertaining and often insightful his writing may even give us a foretaste of our political future stick with him after all time will cure his youth
8863445 i am absolutely angered at the way people have prejudged these matters particularly mr key
8863446 winston peters has been found guilty by a large number of journalists and a large number of politicians when in fact he is completely innocent in respect of these allegations
8863447 virtually conditioning every person in this country to believe in something that is a complete fiction
8863448 on numerous occasions winston peters has promised to clear these matters up
8863449 as late as this morning he was saying it would take five minutes for the sfo to clear it up
8863450 if its as simple as that winston peters would have presented that information months ago
8863451 if i am prime minister of new zealand then i issue warrants to my ministers
8863452 to do that i have to be able to look them in the eye and say can i rely on your word do i believe you am i going to trust you when you give me answers
8863453 various groups including the chatham islands enterprise trust have approached us for support across a range of projects and the government has agreed to help initially with the three priority areas
8863454 graeme from the last test match and the start of the one dayers has been pretty much playing on borrowed time with his elbow unfortunately
8863455 he tried to battle it out as much as he could but after trent bridge we just realised he couldnt go any more
8863456 we are going to rest and rehab graeme and get him ready for the start of our home series which is bangladesh in november and then australia graeme needs the time off now
8863457 we had sent them an e mail requesting for the hearing to be later in mid september as we are still waiting for some more documentation on the case regarding the procedures adopted to conduct the dope tests on asif in the ipl
8863458 we have today got a reply from them saying the hearing will not be held on august 30 and they will inform us of a date later on
8863459 when such discrepancies occur in test results an athlete can appeal and question the testing procedure
8863460 they cant bring the ryder cup on to greens like this
8863461 i said the greens were awful this time last year and something needed to be done nothing was done
8863462 my fear for the ryder cup is that they are just going to keep patching them up over the years
8863463 they should rip them up and redo them with the right construction underneath them they have a bit of rain and the best professionals in europe cant hit the hole from two feet
8863464 they really do need digging up im not a bad putter and i cant remember the last time i three putted from 18 inches
8863465 my kids could come up with a better design in an afternoon
8863466 there is a lot riding on this week getting in the ryder cup for the first time is a big deal but unfortunately this could be won or lost by luck on the greens if it bobbles at the wrong time
8863467 you dont want to be standing over a three footer wondering if the ball is going to run straight
8863468 you can still win the tournament from being one over
8863469 hes won twice this year his form has been very good in recent weeks and hes played on five ryder cups and had four winning teams and hes a natural partner to lee westwood
8863470 if he wenger said to us i want this guy and hes 30m can i buy him then the answer is yes absolutely yes
8863471 we totally back him its his decision im unfortunately not good enough to be a manager myself but id love to be it spending money would be no problem no problem at all its not our decision who he spends money on nor will it ever be our decision
8863472 were not absolutely not giving up on challenging for trophies
8863473 our wage bill is very similar to manchester united and substantially above liverpools its substantially below chelseas but thats expected we pay good salaries and pay them probably more evenly so we have less of the extremes there is an ethos of a team effort
8863474 within europe there are 10 clubs going for top players my background is the diamond business there are no written contracts everything is done on the shake of a hand its done on your word i come from one extreme and now im in this industry where your word is not really worth too much and people do not act ethically
8863475 c rcel com n perpetua y efectiva ni un solo genocida en la rep blica argentina
8863476 i was watching their hands especially mendis my plan was that if i can read his hand i can play well that was the game plan
8863477 i think i was able to read both murali and mendis well scoring 76 and helping my team win is satisfying
8863478 whenever we are at the nets or batting together he tells me how to plan he is such a class reader of the game he always plays with responsibility we learn a lot from him while batting with him it is good we got partnerships in two matches
8863479 since we lost the final of asia cup in pakistan we were very keen to do well in sri lanka we put up a good show here and won a historic series
8863480 i am getting into a good shape now and thanks to the people who gave me support coach such as robin singh coach gary kirsten venkatesh prasad and others they gave me lots of support hopefully i will remain with the same intensity
8863481 i think i have also improved a lot after playing the ipl i learnt a lot from there my batting is coming on well the hesitation of playing big shots also seem to have gone from the mind
8863482 we always talk about the fact that we have a win here we have a win there
8863483 were trying to be more consistently competitive snatching a win here and snatching a win there is not what im about in the future its about being consistent
8863484 coming to australia and everyone knowing that we can be competitive not asking do you think you might win a game
8863485 how many games are you going to win is what i want people to ask
8863486 as soon as you take things for granted i think you find yourself asking questions why youve lost that game
8863487 we graciously accepted the postponement of the tournament which is a big setback to our cricket because players raised a hue and cry over the security but it seems as if these players just dont understand the problems being faced by us
8863488 we are trying to play cricket anywhere if we organise a tournament in pakistan india west indies and sri lanka will be available to tour as they said they had no issues on playing in pakistan
8863489 india is coming to play in pakistan in january and want their players to rest due to the postponement of the ct so india can be ruled out we will be playing west indies in a bilateral three match series in november in abu dhabi so inviting them was out of question
8863490 we still have sri lanka as an option but we have asked a couple of nations to invite us in writing
8863491 we have received favourable response from one of these nations and we are awaiting the response of their sponsors for a one day series it can be a bilateral series a tri nation or even a quadrangular we dont know but we are hopeful of getting cricket next month
8863492 cricket australia does not find it necessary to send a security outfit to india on a pre inspection visit whereas india has also had problems with terrorist attacks in recent times
8863493 i think even these players know they cant afford to offend the indians because all the money now is coming from india i would also love to see graeme smiths response if india were in talks with south africa to play a series next month instead of pakistan
8863494 but we want the betterment and promotion of cricket and we want to move forward but for that the other countries must cooperate with us
8863495 hello and how are you today im calling with an amazing offer from sprintz how would you like saving 200 a year on your cell phone bill

8863501 it was really tough but we worked hard and deserved the goal we deserved the win tonight but they missed some really good chances before the end and god gave us this lucky goal we were lucky tonight it is not easy but i think this win will be very good for us and give the fans some joy

8863504 tim corby was a friend of dads for over 30 years he was a renowned figure in the racing scene and was universally popular in the industry he will be sorely missed by the residents of east and west ilsley his many friends and most of all the corby family
8863505 mick is conscious and able to talk from his hospital bed and hes absolutely devastated at the loss of tim
8863506 ive known him since i was at mick ryans when he was an amateur rider
8863507 the yearling sales were what you associated with tim he talked about the yearlings having gone through the catalogues i remember picking out barathea guest tim checked him out and bought him for mr guest hes had some good horses and managed a lot of horses
8863508 it will be a big blow to the yard and everybody around it as he was a popular figure
8863509 is that he may sell a horse but he took such pride in their achievements even after they had left him like katchit because it gave someone else pleasure it gave him great satisfaction
8863510 hargreaves has been training very well and i think he will get 45 minutes to an hour but i think it is impossible for him to play for england
8863511 this will be his first start and i wont be playing him for the full game he will then need a recovery period so i think it will be very very unlikely that fabio would risk him
8863512 you might think that anyone could play against andorra but england struggled last time then they have to go to croatia that is a very very difficult match you need players who are 100 per cent match fit to play in a game of that nature we know he is not ready for that
8863513 we decided that this was the best time he will be okay for the first group stage match next month
8863514 it was frustrating but its over and done with now and im not giving it too much thought any more
8863515 that day and the day after was tough to try to get my head around it the assistant ref made a terrible decision and it cost us two points but thats just the way it is and we have to get on with it
8863516 we should have scored before that but it didnt happen and we have to look forward to next week i still dont know why it wasnt given i was a body length onside and i dont know how he missed it we all make mistakes but that was a huge mistake for us especially at the beginning of the season
8863517 we could have won three games in a row with nine points at the top of the league instead we have lost two points already in the season
8863518 i dont know ive no idea what has gone on it is very hard to get communication from some people in life we just have to get on with it
8863519 last time we came here in 1999 for some reason i picked a weakened team
8863520 when i saw lazio celebrating at the end of the game like they had won the world cup i said to myself that wouldnt happen again there will be some changes of course but it will be a strong team so hopefully it will represent us in the right way
8863521 having watched zenit last season they played attacking football which captured a lot of peoples attention they had a fantastic season and i hope it turns out to be a really attacking exciting game
8863522 to sit and worry about inflation expectations rather than worry about the fact that the economy is going to go into a recession seems to be misguided
8863523 people have to start to respond to the fact that we are in a recession and the danger is well be in a very serious and long lasting recession unless we do something this is a call to action
8863524 certainly has a great deal of wishful thinking attached to it
8863525 i feel that things i have been fearful about have come to pass and i have actually been pretty accurate in whats coming and i have failed to convince the others of what is appropriate
8863526 people need to understand that sometimes you will have to focus on the timing of issues i think people have become complacent and they have not understood what would happen if an economy starts to slow fast if firms start to close what we have now is a turning point in many ways certainly you might think of it as a paradigm shift we have a global financial crisis an oil shock coming and people with little experience of what is really going on

8863534 we are expecting a go ahead from fifa either on thursday or friday all other plans are complete
8863535 anybody who considers the well being of kenyans will appreciate that hosting an international match at nyayo stadium is a nightmare
8863536 we underestimated the turn out and it was hard to control the traffic facilities at the stadium are also inadequate for such a large crowd
8863537 kasarani stadium is big with a capacity of 60 000 it can easily handle 50 000 when we follow the fifa safety rule of allowing not more than 90 percent capacity
8863538 it also has adequate facilities to allow for crowd control and comfort of the spectators
8863539 the team has taken shape and we want to keep it as consistent as possible
8863540 we are going through the boat carefully to check systems and loads before we physically hoist the sails

8863543 my biggest stand was people getting involved in selection who shouldnt have been thats now been sorted out the presidents veto doesnt exist any more
8863544 so i just had to sit down and make sure i had my mind right and it is something im really proud to do
8863545 we have got to come up and play some good cricket
8863546 the pressure is on england to win the series i think its going to be a tough couple of games
8863547 the way people reacted when we walked off the field and they booed thats more than enough motivation for the guys to put in a big performance
8863548 weve been in this situation before we turned that around so we fully believe we can do it again its an ideal opportunity for me
8863549 weve got some work to do were by no means out of this series we can still come back and win this 3 2 but were going to have to play really well
8863550 i think england are a very good one day side i think theyve made a conscious decision to may be get rid of their bits and pieces players
8863551 when you talk about andrew symonds its like talking about bradman as a batsman or ponting as a batsman hes in a place of his own hes that good an athlete in many ways like usain bolt
8863552 i think hes the best all around athlete for strength power and speed in cricket ive seen jonty rhodes was good real good ricky ponting is real good michael clarke is real good but none of those guys have the flat out brute athletic power and strength of symonds
8863553 its been clear to me this would be the appropriate course of action but there hasnt had to be a lengthy argument about it at all
8863554 its now up to the prime minister to answer questions she is implicated in this
8863555 miss clark hasnt been prepared to do whats right sack a minister who has misled her and the country and who is under investigation by the serious fraud office
8863556 in politics each of us has a reputation and obviously mr peters is very keen as any of us would be to defend his reputation
8863557 you dont ask for them to come along but you have to deal with them and i am endeavouring to deal with this in a way which is fair and has some dignity about it
8863558 as someone who has been in politics a long time i know how precious a reputation is and how hurt people get when theres a serious assault on their reputation
8863559 it just sort of happened i think i love her
8863560 i didnt know you were coming lil ill get you one

8863577 sex scenes are never the easiest scenes to film and you are meant to be very supportive of each other but when dominic came out in a skin colored nappy i just completely lost it
8863578 i just couldnt stop laughing the director did actually come over and said come on pull yourself together this is a serious work here but i could not help it there was this man standing there in a skin colored nappy

8863592 which absorb most of the south african navys financial resources
8863593 maritime safety pollution response search and rescue protection of maritime resources and interdiction of maritime offenders
8863594 with the transformation of the south african national defence force severe budget cuts and downsizing the sa navy has become a shadow of its original force structure with a number of gaps apparent in its capacity
8863595 these vessels cost between r250 million and r300 million each as opposed to the r4 billion cost of the frigates the reality is that if the government had not forced the navy to buy the frigates and submarines it would have been able to purchase the patrol boats which get the work done
8863596 at least regarding the frigates the south african navy would have saved about r1 billion in 1999 rands which would have gone a long way in operational and support costs
8863597 it seems it was resurrected and edited very recently to justify the purchase of the patrol vessels
8863598 it is difficult to estimate the costs the state will pay in view of the fact the corruption trial has not yet started and the anticipated application by zuma to stay the proceedings
8863599 it is difficult to determine the duration of the trial considering the postponements and other interlocutory proceedings which might arise
8863600 the fee may also be influenced by the size of the legal team representing him in court
8863601 as a result of the direct interest of the state in the matter the presidency agreed to pay the cost of the legal representation in that matter subject to the condition that in the event of a conviction in the case the funds expended will be recovered from the accused

8863624 perhaps if we take an approach in an objective and scientific way we can then have a way of phasing it affirmative action out rather than say lets do away with it you may find that we do away with it prematurely and settle with a problem
8863625 affirmative action and current employment equity legislation would never be repealed but would be intensified instead

8863656 dengan nash syara yang shohih yang tidak didapati adanya pertentangan atau suatu ijma
8863657 jika enkgau memperhatikan penafsiran yang disebutkan oleh ash showi tentang perkara yang qathi dan yang zhonni sesungguhnya ia sedikitpun tidak mendatangkan suatu yang baku dimana terjadinya perbedaan persepsi pada suatu nash syara tidaklah menghilangkan adanya sifat qathiyah pada nash itu dijumpai sekian banyak masalah masalah furuiyah yang sifatnya qahiyah walaupun didapati adanya khilaf pada masalah tersebut

8863667 scotiabanks strategy of diversifying across business lines and geographies has enabled the bank to continue to perform well during a challenging period for the global financial services industry
8863668 total revenue grew 5 from the same period last year as assets increased a strong 54 billion or 13 with contributions from all three growth platforms domestic banking international banking and scotia capital

8863670 mortgage growth was recorded in all sales channels leading to a gain in market share while personal deposits grew 12 to lead the industry in market share growth
8863671 results in international banking benefited from continued robust organic loan growth particularly in mortgages and credit cards strong deposit gains and the positive impact of acquisitions partly offset by higher taxes and increased provisions for credit losses
8863672 scotia capital had a strong quarter benefitting from its diversified portfolio of businesses with record revenues in scotia waterous and fixed income continued strong contributions from scotiamocatta and foreign exchange operations and an increased contribution from its lending businesses
8863673 the banks risk management culture is enabling us to effectively manage through a difficult period in world capital markets
8863674 our capital position remains strong allowing the bank to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and ongoing business development opportunities
8863675 the second half of 2008 is showing improvement compared to the first two quarters of the fiscal year with continued asset growth in all three business lines and a rebound in capital markets activity while we are on track to achieve three of our four key financial and operational targets with slower global growth it is unlikely that we will meet our eps growth objectives as set at the end of last year

8863692 our same store sales compared to last year headed in a positive direction during the quarter despite depressed consumer confidence and a tougher economy challenges in our soft lines were offset by improved performance in our big ticket areas we remain focused on becoming canadas no 1 retailer by providing products services and solutions that improve the lives of our customers and build lifetime relationships
8863693 seasonally our first quarter is always one of our weakest but we are nonetheless not happy with these results we are making strong advances in our plan to return to profitability
8863694 for 2008 we are still forecasting higher revenues than in 2007 we are also considering new opportunities that could have a positive impact on sales in 2008
8863695 i would like to thank christina for her dedication her efforts and her professionalism she has been able to successfully meet a lot of challenges and with her presence to the company scientific advisory committee we will continue to benefit from her expertise i wish her a lot of success in her new position
8863696 good progress continues to be made in the onshore fabrication of the west don facilities and we are delighted that development drilling operations and offshore construction activities have commenced this represents a major milestone for stratic and the west don field which remains on target for first oil production by april 1 2009
8863697 our 2008 second quarter and first half results are those of a developing company and dont truly illustrate the extent of the progress that forterra is making in building our business
8863698 we now have clearly demonstrated the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our manufacturing process for mass producing worm castings and continue to ramp up our production we have ongoing negotiations with several potential very significant new customers in canada and the united states we believe that we now have satisfied the concerns of these potential customers that we could meet their requirements for large volume shipments of our soil enrichment products
8863699 we are pursuing the development of new markets including green house growers that we expect will lessen or eliminate the seasonality of our business in canada and of course will continue to seek additional customers in the united states
8863700 with the additions during the second quarter of richard denyes as president and chief operating officer bruce bent as chief financial officer and stanley sajnovic as our plant manager we have strengthened our management team and believe that we now have the people we need to drive our growth in sales and toward future profitability we also were pleased to announce last week that we have retained agronomist tom ferencevic as a consultant to the company we expect that he will play an important role in helping us to build our business
8863701 subsequent to the end of the second quarter in july we completed a private placement that raised gross proceeds of 2 5 million through the issue of 16 680 000 units 16 680 000 common shares and 8 340 000 common share purchase warrants our current view is that with these funds and the increasing cash flow that our sales are generating forterra is adequately funded to support our plans for increasing production the expansion into new manufacturing facilities our r amp d programs and marketing and sales programs
8863702 we remain focused on our strategic goals and objectives with the customer at the centre of everything we do this is reflected in the overall results weve reported and our market share gains in the p amp c canada business the impact of the deterioration in the u s housing market has affected our results and while uncertainty exists we are confident in the earnings capacity of the core franchise
8863703 we are steadily improving p amp c canadas market share in both personal and commercial loans our focus on the customer is increasingly becoming entrenched in the organization and is paying off customer loyalty continues to improve our customer base is growing and we are strengthening our customer relationships
8863704 private client group delivered record net income achieving broad based revenue growth in a difficult market environment
8863705 results in bmo capital markets were up year over year but continue to reflect current market conditions with low activity levels in some of our investment banking businesses our interest rate sensitive businesses performed well
8863706 overall bmos revenue increased 7 5 year over year reflecting growth in our businesses and the impacts of this quarters charges related to the capital markets environment and last years commodities losses expenses increased at a comparable rate reflecting the impact of investments in our business severance and low capital taxes a year ago managing expenses while investing in future growth will continue to be a priority

8863736 autrement comment pourrait il proposer des centaines de millions de dollars dexon rations fiscales aux grandes entreprises et aux compagnies p troli res mais pas un centime dall gements fiscaux pour plus dune centaine de millions dam ricains

8863738 ce nest pas parce que john mccain sen moque cest parce que john mccain ne comprend pas

8863758 this guy has done everything that has been asked of him and more and yet the city and the province have made it impossible for him
8863759 he has been borrowing from friends and family to keep up the business and now hes going to have to sell his townhouse
8863760 this definitely had nothing to do with the quality of the program
8863761 the staff were doing an exemplary job theyd done an awful lot with very little in fact they had really brought up the quality of the program
8863762 this centre has been part of my childs life since she was 18 months old
8863763 the teachers the cook they are like family to us they really care about the children
8863764 i was pleased to score again in europe and i have a good record in the competition but the fact that we won was the main thing
8863765 ive played on right for the last 10 15 games for the team i try to work really hard also in defence and do a lot of important things for the team as well as scoring goals so i dont mind playing on the right
8863766 i will play wherever the boss wants me to play for me the most important thing is to win some trophies and i think we have a good enough squad to do something this year
8863767 we know were not playing really well but were good in defence and we always have the quality and belief that we can score in every game
8863768 and thats the important thing we can play better and things will come right
8863769 thats the thing about the team speaking for myself i didnt give my best performance for liverpool but thats not important
8863770 what is important is that we won the game and i did everything to make that happen one chance can change everything and i was really happy to score
8863771 sometimes things like this happen in football i just said before you cant find any bad sides in europe and standard liege are a very tough side they were really strong in the end we were really happy that it didnt go to penalties
8863772 but this is the fun thing about football we know how good the champions league can be and we always want to be part of it fighting until the end
8863773 the fans were great for us and they helped us keep going right to the end
8863774 we dont know whats going to happen about players coming in
8863775 weve got a good squad and every good player is welcome in our team i want to win things and you can only win things with the best players
8863776 we were a bit tired in extra time and we thought it might go to penalties but thankfully it didnt dirk scored and we are through
8863777 they were a good team over both legs it was really tough it was not the best game but we are through dirk scored at the end for us which was great i dont know how many goals he has scored now in europe but it is his competition
8863778 we are not playing our best and we need to do better we are at the early part of the season and in a few months we will be at the top of our fitness every team is like this
8863779 man cannot discover new oceans unless he has the courage to lose sight of the shore
8863780 schools are going to need some time at the beginning of the year to get to this its a busy time and high schools with pools will have to redo their timetables because when they set them before the summer they thought the pools would be closed
8863781 so people will have to be a little patient it will probably be early october before swim classes are up and running but then again we have 472 schools that dont have pools
8863782 realistically there are going to be a number of children who arrive at school next week who think the schools pools are open but theyll find the doors closed

8863789 evraz delivered an exceptionally strong performance in the first half of 2008

8863815 he is certainly the liberal leader whos taken his party furthest to the left at least since former prime minister pierre trudeau
8863816 i think this is not a time to go back to trudeau style economic policies
8863817 even if its true i dont think its a real recession there are job losses but overall employment is pretty stable
8863818 we will not only abide by the letter of the law but we will work with elections canada to reach a common understanding of the interpretation of the law and that is what we will follow
8863819 they can no longer hold themselves back from being who they are

8863829 no one is going to see your personal situation and circumstances or your financial position the way you can
8863830 you have the best perspective on what needs to happen next but you dont have to go it alone
8863831 many people dont see the need for a budget because they have enough money coming in to cover their expenses
8863832 but encountering a disability and having to stop work dramatically alters the picture for people and their families thats when all the numbers really need to come under the magnifying glass

8863835 i am preparing for the start of the new icl season this year and so far no one has told me not to practice here
8863836 there was never any ban on shabbir ahmed to practice he is only banned from representing pakistan in tests and odis and from first class cricket
8863837 he is a pakistani and we have no objection in his practicing at nca
8863838 any player who has represented pakistan can practice here but that does not mean we are thinking about changing our policy on the icl it remains the same when the icc recognises it we will also adopt a softer line
8863839 right now i am here to train and get tips from aaqib javed and geoff lawson who are at the academy

8863841 telemedicine can play a key role in solving our national health care issues
8863842 being invited to present this solution to our national and state democratic leaders is very gratifying not only for amd but for all of those individuals and organizations that have worked so hard to make telemedicine what it is today
8863843 shes nothing but a pretty face and a good fuck walang laman ang utak
8863844 it is legitimate for the people of pakistan to ask whether that story is true or not and what is his response because so far neither the government of pakistan nor mr zardari has responded
8863845 i would humbly request him that he should withdraw his candidature in the supreme national interest in the interest of democratic stability and also in the interest of the future prospects of his party
8863846 donovan told me to play with confidence and have fun with the game
8863847 football is a game its a sport and its that way for a reason you cant live and die by the game of football just go out there and have fun and keep a smile on your face
8863848 if you look at my career in college every time i tend to have a smile and enjoy myself i definitely have the most success
8863849 thats something that im going to try to do throughout this entire season
8863850 instead of finishing the run i started sliding a little bit and the guy just hit me
8863851 after that game the coach went on me to run to the finish as the season went on and i started running harder and breaking tackles it really paid off
8863852 you knock off the no 1 team that definitely solidified the type of team that we are that we were last year
8863853 it was just one of those situations that youll never forget it gave this team momentum to go out there and have success after that game
8863854 thats something i struggled with as a freshman there were a lot of things that i just didnt know and a lot of things that were new to me i really worked at it i got with my coaches in the offseason i spent some time with the receivers and i did everything i could to go out there and be a better passer and its really worked out for me everything is more fluid and im just more confident now
8863855 i just got done telling some people that he has improved in every area whether it be the way he talks with the media or the way he practices
8863856 now its going to be important that he goes out there and shows it what i think is going to happen is that hes a much improved player
8863857 hes a competitor he loves to compete offensive coordinator michael locksley has done such a good job in teaching him how to be a quarterback to juices credit he has taken the bull by the horns and done the things necessary to help him be a much improved player
8863858 theres so many similarities between myself and donovan as far as size height and arm strength
8863859 we are just able to move around in the pocket and make plays with our legs theres a lot of similarities between him and i obviously hes in the nfl and has done it professionally while im still an amateur theres still a little way to go
8863860 what he mcdonald wasnt doing was taking a proactive enough approachto the cost base
8863861 essentially he said that there wasnt any flexibility inthe cost base so basically saying ok this trials gone wrongbut were going to carry on burning cash at the same rate which obviously gave concern to a lot of people and the companyhave come out this morning and said that they have introducedsome flexibility into the cost base

8863877 whatever caroline wants to do she will definitely do but she certainly is a wonderful addition to our democratic bench of new leaders
8863878 that was one of the most amazing moments that ive ever had and i told my children that theyll ever see in their life
8863879 i have no airline reservations to ohio my guess is mitt romney
8863880 if he picks someone like a romney all hes done is sort of double down on out of touch being on the side of big corporate interests
8863881 romney is an expert on things like cayman island tax shelters
8863882 this report that i called sen lieberman and told him you call sen mccain and withdraw from the vice presidential race is incorrect
8863883 hes a former marine and great guy and hes older than i am so that might work
8863884 the team selected them and there were a lot of guys who got votes so we have a lot of leaders but those were very good choices and the team really respects them
8863885 weve known each other for 20 years and if it wasnt for him calling i wouldnt have left new mexico
8863886 i mostly wanted to see my coaches and these teachers who helped me out a lot in high school
8863887 last time was special because it was my first trip but this years more special because ive always dreamt of playing against florida
8863888 right now im happy that weve been practicing at 7 oclock the last four years
8863889 its cool its something that your body definitely has to get adjusted to after the first week its pretty simple
8863890 were not going to be able to experience it until were there i believe in my coaches and my players but its a big challenge
8863891 we have to go and be ready to play from the start theres going to be a lot of people but weve played in front of a lot of people and whatever the condition is we got to play our best right from the start
8863892 its just a matter of trying our best to contain that speed not let them break loose in the open field and secure the tackles because thats where it shows the most when they get in the open field and they break one tackle and they get the opportunity to build up their speed thats when theyre unstoppable
8863893 what the coach wants him to do in the scheme of things he does very well
8863894 hes a physical player a person that doesnt shy away from contact
8863895 its just the way it is and we have to go play the best we can
8863896 coach jones was more laid back and mellow but mcmackin is going to motivate you and get the best out of you
8863897 theyll play with a lot of passion motivation and passion is everything no matter how talented you are

8863902 it was underground all i could see were the sandaled feet of people walking on the sidewalk outside that was all i got out of a nice day
8863903 you know we all are just struggling in our own way to be free
8863904 i didnt want to fall into a trap of being overly sincere or alienating people
8863905 i was sensitive to the idea that if i was going to sing the songs that i wanted to sing i would have to make them entertaining
8863906 i wanted to make the music about more than me because me isnt really all that interesting
8863907 long before i was probably ready to do it i knew it was what i was going to do
8863908 this whole adventure is kind of a conversion of experience from fear
8863909 hip hop drum n bass techno dubstep all these styles that come out of the urban landscape are really just part of the global conversation of how technology is changing the way we think about culture
8863910 ill be riffing on music as information to me its all about patterns and beats its all code at the end of the day
8863911 im going to focus on the arc of recording how the idea of recording itself has changed creativity
8863912 when you look at spookys career it really is about someone who is unafraid to explore sound in all its forms and use technology to reconstruct things
8863913 music fans from the toronto hip hop scene can be highly critical theyre not easy to please so for this to have some kind of cachet it had to be somebody who could not only reach out to the urban world but also cross some bridges spooky captures a lot of the elements that make the culture interesting from an innovation standpoint
8863914 one of the big things were doing this year is a special dance component dance has become the staple of television these days now that weve seen the best that america has on those dance shows i think people realize how much talent we have here locally

8863962 kasus tersebut sudah pernah terjadi di lhokseumawe beberapa hari lalu seorang pria secara tiba tiba meninggal setelah menerima panggilan dari seseorang tidak dikenal
8863963 tapi hidup kita tidak seluruhnya matematika dan angka angka ada dimensi non matematis dan di luar angka angka logis
8863964 ya kalau kita hanya tertuju pada gaji kita akan menjadi orang pelit individualis bahkan bisa jadi tamak loba karena berapapun sebenarnya nilai gaji setiap orang dia tidak akan pernah merasa cukup lalu dia akan berkata bagaimana mau sedekah untuk kita saja kurang
8863965 mana mungkin dengan gaji sebesar itu kita bisa hidup tenang bisa sedekah bisa berbagi
8863966 ya karena kita masih menggunakan pola pikir matematis cobalah keluar dari medium itu oke sakarang jawab pertanyaan saya kita punya uang sepuluh ribu makan bakso enam ribu es campur tiga ribu yang seribu kita berikan pada pengemis berapa sisa uang kita
8863967 tapi saya jawab masih ada kita masih memiliki sisa seribu rupiah dan seribu rupiah itu abadi bahkan memancing rezeki yang tidak terduga
8863968 ya memang habis karena kita masih memakai logika matematis tapi cobalah tinggalkan pola pikir itu dan beralihlah pada logika sedekah uang yang seribu itu dinikmati pengemis jangan salah bisa jadi puluhan lontaran doa keberkahan untuk kita keluar dari mulut pengemis itu atas pemberian kita itu baru satu pengemis bagaimana jika kita memberikannya lebih itu dicatat malaikat dan didengar allah itu menjadi sedekah kita pada allah dan menjadi penolong di akhirat sesungguhnya yang seribu itulah milik kita yang abadi sementara nilai bakso dan es campur itu ujung ujungnya masuk wc
8863969 terus gimana caranya mas agar bisa menyeimbangkan nilai metematis dengan dimensi sedekah itu
8863970 pertama ingat sedekah tidak akan membuat orang jadi miskin tapi sebaliknya menjadikan ia kaya kedua jangan terikat dengan keterbatasan gaji tapi percayalah pada keluasan rizki ketiga lihatlah ke bawah jangan lihat ke atas dan yang terakhir padukanlah nilai qonaah ridha dan syukur
8863971 perumpamaan nafkah yang dikeluarkan oleh orang orang yang menafkahkan hartanya di jalan allah adalah serupa dengan sebutir benih yang menumbuhkan tujuh bulir pada tiap tiap bulir seratus biji allah melipat gandakan ganjaran bagi siapa yang dia kehendaki dan allah maha luas karunia nya lagi maha mengetahui

8864003 i think instant replay will definitely help that but i think it will take a little bit longer in the game and every year we go to spring training and the season starts and they always talk to us about shortening the time of the game
8864004 if they have to do a replay youre standing out there for five minutes doing nothing
8864005 they want to speed the game up make the call

8864018 weve got a great chance weve got them all to get back in and weve got a great chance at the next stage we got through to the next round it was like a cup final to them but we are through and that is the main thing
8864019 overall i would have wanted us to play much better considering the crowd that turned up in great numbers for a tie that was effectively over
8864020 we did enough to get through in the tie but i believe we could improve immensely on that performance
8864021 but what matters is we got through i was hoping that perhaps we would play better pick up the tempo and be a wee bit stronger it was pretty comfortable but the second half sort of faded into nothing
8864022 i am delighted to be in the hat for the first round i know we were expected to win as the premier league side but if youd said to me before the icelandic game that we would go through i would have been very pleased i was delighted with the goals that we scored over there and perhaps that maybe took a little bit of edge off
8864023 i thought he was excellent and if i was calling a man of the match it would have been him wayne routledge had little spells he had the beating of his man and perhaps he can do that type of thing more often

8864041 shortly after moving to powys our friends in london would say whats it like where you live
8864042 we would say its horrible stay away because we didnt want anyone to know how peaceful and relaxing it was in comparison to the rat race in london
8864043 that was 30 years ago but the pace of life hasnt altered a great deal since then
8864044 sometimes the lifestyle makes us laugh especially when people born and bred in the county take things for granted
8864045 for instance i remember being with a farmer one day and i was seeing these wonderful views for the first time i was amazed but all the farmer was concerned about was whether his tractor radio could receive radio 1
8864046 people from outside the area see powys as a rural idyll but if theyre not prepared to sacrifice a few things then they can learn to dislike their new home
8864047 we know a couple who moved to powys because they wanted to escape the rat race but the woman in the relationship couldnt drive and she eventually hated the area
8864048 but in some ways the drawbacks add to the areas charm and thats why some people move here
8864049 for example i recently saw two old women clapping and mouthing well done as a police car drove through llanfair it was hilarious but charming at the same time can you imagine that happening in cardiff or birmingham
8864050 i would never go back to living in the south east of england its over crowded and a stressful place
8864051 for instance if i forget to lock my car at night it doesnt bother me because i know it will be there in the morning
8864052 powys has some of the lowest crimes rates in the uk and that gives us peace of mind
8864053 everybody knows each other and its such a friendly place a five minute trip to the shops can turn into 20 minutes when you stop and chat

8864057 its hard to evaluate from the sideline but well get a good look at it and that will certainly help us in our evaluation
8864058 i think its a stressful time for a lot of people but i know that ive worked hard and played hard now we cant control what decisions are made
8864059 you get the check and the wideout makes a great play in the corner of the end zone thats a pretty good feeling
8864060 its exciting to just put points on the board thats my main goal going in there and this whole preseason thats how its been
8864061 we were planning on winning the game if we got the ball back
8864062 weve had bad records in preseason what counts is how you play in the regular season thats what matters

8864070 selecting a lawyer is a personal matter you must judge which particular attorney will be best for you before making a decision however you may want to contact several lawyers or law firms to gather some comparative information
8864071 i want to give people the choice to review all the general information facts and details about this business before they decide to get in contact with me if they know about the business already it helps me answer questions that relate to their own personal situation and see if this is the business opportunity they are looking for without wasting anyones time un necessarily
8864072 i love the leads provided by cutting edge media that company really delivers and the advantage of the movie and premium campaigns is that people inquiring are given the option to start walking through the csgs 3 step online marketing tour right away i continue to use their campaigns and encourage my team members to do the same the system works if you do its been proven by other happy csg members time and time again
8864073 i saw a need and fully believe in using several different sources to promote your coastal vacations business i also wanted to get people straight credible and verifiable information about coastal vacations the coastal synergy group the coastal success team and myself without having to jump through virtual hoops i have included testimonials from my team members on the website complete with contact information potential business owners that are looking for a serious and genuine business opportunity can find out right away if this business system and myself fit their personal needs they dont have to take it from me what this business the csg and myself are all about an additional benefit is that my team members and associates also have an additional form of lead generation that is available to them free of charge anyone that contacts them to learn more becomes a training sale at the same time i can teach them about various marketing and promotions techniques that will take them to the next level in their own businesses everyone wins
8864074 yes as a matter of fact it is my site was officially finished on friday may 4 2007 i have been pleasantly surprised by the unexpectedly quick response i am getting so far im not looking for everyone to join my team and work with me but those who resonate with my personality and philosophy are finding me its that old saying in action build it and they will come im having lots of fun meeting great people and learning new things constantly

8864091 die nachfrage nach tagesgeldkonten ist derzeit sehr hoch sie hat sich in den vergangenen drei monaten im verh ltnis zu den vergleichszeitr umen der jahre 2004 bis 2007 im durchschnitt verdreifacht
8864092 das liegt vor allem an den unsicheren b rsenzeiten und der kommenden abgeltungsteuer die deutschen suchen nach einer sicheren m glichkeit ihr geld anzulegen und auch kurzfristig dar ber zu verf gen
8864093 nachdem wir im fr hjahr 2008 viel zeit energie und finanzielle mittel in eine berarbeitung der oberfl che die verbesserung der bedienbarkeit und ein kontensystem f r die nutzer investiert hatten gingen wir davon aus dass es l nger dauern w rde diese marke zu erreichen

8864095 information is stimuli that have meaning in some context for its receiver when information is entered into and stored in a computer it is generally referred to as data information translated into a form that is more convenient to move or process when information is packaged or used for understanding or doing something it is known as knowledge to an enterprise or an individual the possession of information or the ability to quickly locate it
8864096 excess information beyond what is desired or needed by any user requiring non productive processing
8864097 the situation is worst where organizations are in transition changing from the old style of handling information to it or where it dependent new generation of executives is taking over family business enterprises
8864098 i have to keep up to date on the technology sector i have to review feedback from clients and also see what competitors are doing by visiting their web sites reading online press releases and newsletters the information that i get is one of the most important tools in my sales game but i am afraid that i miss so much
8864099 given the nature of my business and rapid fluctuation in currency rates i have to keep a constant watch on the global money market this is what i do last thing before going to bed and first when i get up in the morning before coming to the office in addition i also have to follow important events in the world that can cast tangible effects on economies of the world but it is difficult to keep track of it all i want sometime to myself but it is really not possible in this line of business
8864100 before we employed it night staff used to produce required inventory report now my inventory is on networked computers and is up to date all the time i can see it any time basing on this i can shift resources from one unit to another and control production but when it comes to information required for running my business in global market it sometime is daunting to find what i am looking for and to weed through the junk
8864101 they can sometime aggravate the overload problem because instead of how much one needs they make it possible to get more but given enough time and practice one gets wise in distinguishing what is important in any particular field
8864102 information overload is a fascinating phenomenon every web user experience at least some of the times i have no idea what humankind is going to do with all the information writings analysis images sound tracks movies websites you name it people do not seem to be healthier richer or happier because they have them at a personal level i deal through prioritizing time boxing and when possible multi tasking what gets done gets done what not oh well i avoid time suckers such as surfing the internet i go to sites where i have business and finish quickly no forums chats very little tv radio is a favourite because does not tie me up
8864103 knowing what is needed and cutting out unnecessary clutter outside the desired scope saves a lot of time

8864110 i didnt have a venue id never done anything like this before
8864111 and it hit me what ever happened to the bohemian vibe the artistic spirit of big sur its there among the locals but why isnt there anything else going on
8864112 its really going to be a tell tale sign when that first harsh rain comes
8864113 if you listen to the hydraulics experts and the geologists
8864114 the news sounds more and more bleak theyre predicting that this could be a very difficult winter and not just this winter but two or three winters beyond that

8864121 to come out some morning and see that bloom and realize youre the first person that ever saw that kind of flower there is nothing like it
8864122 you have to dig them up in the fall and then store them in a particular way in a particular medium

8864137 the information simply came in to us and we were in a position to act on it in a very quick manner
8864138 ive seen so many over my lifetime that these ones are just run of the mill
8864139 the initial responders the patrol members were willing to pitch in and help out
8864140 we havent done the full computer forensics thats going to take at least a couple of months for us to actually get to them
8864141 we just hope that when it comes time to host that we have some players that are involved in the program
8864142 they were unloading the grain and at some point it was realized that the boys at least one of them anyway was trapped in the grain
8864143 these types of trailers theres a chute underneath it comes into a hopper and at the base of the hopper theres a sliding trap door that opens to unload these trailers so they unload very rapidly
8864144 in the colony way of life the younger we can teach them the better they were just absolutely super kids they were smart beyond measure
8864145 there would be some damage although it would not be widespread but certainly some chimneys would be damaged there would be cracks in plaster and some masonry would be damaged on the outside
8864146 these are very moderate there are earthquakes this size in the world every day
8864147 we are working in close partnership with the appropriate levels of government and stakeholders to ensure that collectively were appropriately prepared
8864148 we have swarms of activity in this area every once in a while
8864149 some hours we have an earthquake every minute or two other hours we are not quite so busy
8864150 there are so many earthquakes and so much interest from the media we havent had time yet
8864151 im not blaming you but there are only a few of us who do this
8864152 the product it produces for the domestic market is the same as the product it would produce for the export market
8864153 they were great competitors i have a lot of respect for them
8864154 everyone was expecting 20 to one games 20 to three games experts across the country
8864155 but these guys in this dressing room they believed in themselves and they made these games competitive
8864156 we know that two thirds of the cases were probably not even seeing these are people who either have no symptoms or have mild symptoms and theyre out there spreading the virus and theres absolutely nothing we can do about that
8864157 it probably doesnt make sense to employ legal measures against people who have mumps who are finding it difficult to stay home as weve asked
8864158 you can exclude people from school i would be prepared to consider that for sure in an outbreak situation in which large numbers of people werent being immunized but if they all hang out in a mall its not much help
8864159 were not running low for normal supplies what were trying to figure out is if we need 200 000 extra doses could we get them and how long would it take
8864160 that hole would have taken a considerable period of time to dig
8864161 it appears one was on the outside of the escape plan that was the one that was caught almost immediately
8864162 they might have told management but they didnt share it with us staff arent happy about it its a huge risk
8864163 there are people who live very close people who have testified against these individuals who live less than a mile from the institution
8864164 our top priority right now is to provide advice to affected ticket holders about their options rights and recourse and refer them to appropriate organizations for immediate help
8864165 we will expedite the matter for sure and we will give priority to those requests from charter air carriers who want additional flights to bring back stranded passengers from wherever we will put a priority on those applications
8864166 we are monitoring the increase in calls made to our call centre and reservation centre
8864167 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations
8864168 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights

8864208 ich m chte zun chst michael kenan und roy cohen f r die von ihnen f r wizcom geleistet arbeit danken und ihnen gleichzeitig alles gute f r die zukunft w nschen zu meinen wichtigsten aufgaben als ceo wird der abschluss des turnaround programms die weiterentwicklung unserer vertriebskan le sowie die vorbereitung des eintritts in neue m rkte sein wir sehen erste positive resultate es ist jedoch noch zu fr h um hierzu detaillierte informationen ver ffentlichen zu k nnen
8864209 obwohl wir einen verlust und einen erheblichen umsatzr ckgang ver ffentlicht haben beginnen wir erste ergebnisse unserer turnaround strategie zu sp ren mit dem aktuellen auftragseingang aus unserer bestehenden kundenbasis gehen wir davon aus den umsatzr ckgang bis zum jahresende reduzieren zu k nnen f r das gesamtjahr erwarten wir einen umsatz von rund 8 5 mio us dollar dar ber hinaus haben wir die technischen probleme bei unserem produkt der dritten generation behoben und zum beginn des dritten quartals wieder mit der auslieferung nach china begonnen hierdurch sowie aufgrund der implementierten kostensenkungsma nahmen glauben wir in den bereich der profitabilit t zur ckkehren zu k nnen
8864210 in sachen liquidit t erwarten wir obwohl wir innerhalb der letzten sechs monate einen r ckgang der finanziellen mittel hinnehmen mussten dass wir im zweiten halbjahr einen positiven cash flow erwirtschaften k nnen dennoch bewerten wir parallel die m glichkeiten zur st rkung unserer bilanz die ernennung von yulia omari zum vp finance wird auf der operativen seite f r einen reibungslosen bergang sorgen da sie bereits seit sommer 2007 im unternehmen arbeitet

8864214 la financiaci n privada la tenemos que promover porque es el nico camino que nos va a llevar a una financiaci n suficiente
8864215 con una normativa muy transparente para incentivar la colaboraci n p blica privada algo que nada tiene que ver con la privatizaci n de la universidad
8864216 hay que comprender que cada una tiene sus propias dificultades y situaci n y habr que ver cu l es el acompa amiento
8864217 la universidad espa ola seguir siendo de las m s baratas de europa
8864218 ser a un error investigar s lo lo que requiera el mercado
8864219 lo importante es que dentro de la ecuaci n total la financiaci n privada sume si es la parte de investigaci n aplicada pues estupendo la financiaci n p blica se destinar entonces a la investigaci n m s b sica y a disciplinas que no tengan una aplicaci n tan inmediata
8864220 la parte p blica ha hecho un esfuerzo de financiaci n y ahora hay que estimular la parte privada
8864221 precisamente ahora es un momento para reflexionar sobre el modelo de colaboraci n con la universidad
8864222 en los campus de excelencia internacional la empresa privada estar en la ecuaci n creo que este a o conseguiremos concretar alguno
8864223 pero creo que ser a un error poner una financiaci n en el sistema si no hay reflexi n previa y una hoja de ruta para alcanzar la excelencia as con unos objetivos claros podremos atraer a la financiaci n privada si no ser imposible
8864224 si logramos que los estudiantes elijan qu estudiar y d nde por criterios de excelencia y no por cercan a conseguiremos que aumente la competitividad de las universidades
8864225 las facultades y licenciaturas que tengan pocos estudiantes se quedar n sin ninguno es la universidad la que tiene que dar sus argumentos para decir tengo 10 estudiantes y voy a tener cinco pero la sigo manteniendo por estos motivos
8864226 no creo en las pol ticas intervencionistas del estado creo en la responsabilidad en la toma de decisiones
8864227 es fundamental que el sistema de estructura y gobernanza de la universidad sea uno de los ejes de nuestra estrategia ser su decisi n pero creo en el efecto imitaci n habr universidades que quieran entrar en el sistema de transparencia y estandarizaci n en sus cuentas para mejorar

8864247 the two new cyber shot phones that we have announced today share certain characteristics both phones place ease of use and best in class picture quality at the heart of their designs
8864248 yet both appeal to different audiences one is engineered to let you take more pictures in more places and the other is designed to look as stunning as the pictures it takes
8864249 first of all i would like to thank mr kenan and mr cohen for the work they have done for wizcom and wish them success for the future my main tasks as the new ceo of wizcom shall be to complete the turnaround program to develop our distribution channels and oversee our entrance into new markets the first signs are positive but it is too early to make any definite statements about this
8864250 although we posted a loss and a significant drop in revenues we are starting to see the results of our turnaround strategy we are witnessing developments in order taking from our customer base that should see us reduce the drop in revenues towards the end of the year and we expect to finish the year with around us 8 5 million in revenues moreover we have overcome the technical issues we had with our third generation product and were able to restart shipping to china at the beginning of q3 this in addition to the cost cutting measures we have implemented in q2 and that will start to have an impact from q3 onwards should we believe see us return to profitability
8864251 as to our cash position even if we have witnessed a decrease over the past six months we do expect that we will generate a positive cash flow over the next six months we are however exploring options to strengthen our balance sheet the appointment of ms omari as vp finance will ensure a smooth transition of operations as she has been with the company since summer 2007

8864257 a little bit but you always are in the preseason

8864261 were expecting our 28th year of consecutive sold out seasons
8864262 the slump in mortgage approvals is consistent with further sharp falls in house prices in the months ahead
8864263 reality has hit home in the prime market with sellers happier to adjust their prices in order to clinch a sale
8864264 house prices are no longer simply falling they are crashing all the signs are that we are at the beginning and not the end of a very painful process
8864265 if the housing slump continues much longer than this we are likely to see 10 000 plus jobs going
8864266 if you miss a mortgage payment this will be recorded on your credit file and may make it more difficult to get a mortgage or to remortgage in the future
8864267 you must ensure that you switch back to a repayment deal as soon as you can afford to do so otherwise the capital will not be repaid by the end of the mortgage term
8864268 if you are on a standard variable rate or another rate without penalties you could ask your lender what other rates they have to offer

8864301 i am single and looking and am told by pogo chatters that i am funny i have a serious side and am very opinionated about things in our world and life in general i dont smoke and drink socially and i am a great cook

8864303 i was born and raised a redneck from the south in my home town of wichita kansas but i now live in michigan i enjoy football camping occasionally visiting the casino and playing pogo games
8864304 i am 20 years old i am self revealing neat unpredictable silly charming aggressive assertive organized and far from ordinary i happen to be a social chameleon
8864305 we will definitely see an apple wireless phone product introduced this year
8864306 whether its introduced this tuesday or not is a big question if i were guessing id be very surprised if they didnt introduce it then because theres no new frontier that they could break with their existing product lines
8864307 i dont have it lingering over my head will he get reinstated will he not get reinstated i just have to keep myself out of bad situations like i have been doing the last six or seven months
8864308 immediately i called my mom because ive been beating myself up but my mom has been through this roller coaster with me
8864309 mascherano is training well lucas likewise so both of them will come into contention for the aston villa game and we also have the young player damien plessis
8864310 we have plenty of options now in the middle but i have no problem considering mascherano for the match after his trip to beijing
8864311 maybe having won a second gold medal he will be inspired to perform well for us
8864312 he has kept in contact with me during the olympics and has been keen to know everything that has been going on at the club now he is back he is a welcomed addition to our playing strength
8864313 you must give credit to dirk kuyt sometimes he makes a mistake and people react but he never lets it worry him
8864314 he goes again he gives everything and he did just that for 120 minutes to make sure we qualified for the group stages
8864315 the key is that he never hides he played on the right on the left and then as a second striker with fernando torres
8864316 what he gives to the team is really important you must judge over a full season sometimes in one game it may not always be perfect
8864317 it has been well documented that he wasnt happy with some of the comments but i was delighted to sort it out with him and we had a good chat
8864318 sure i did raise a few questions about tactics and the sight of steven gerrard playing on the left wing for england against the czechs last week
8864319 the first thing he said to me when we met after we lost 1 0 to united was harry if you can play sylvain distin at left back then i can play steven gerrard on the left wing
8864320 i replied i think youre right mate from then on it was a great opportunity to talk about a few things and get a few things straight
8864321 one of which is that among the points i raised i made it clear i have enormous respect for capello
8864322 the guy has a superb record and if he cannot make a success of the england team no one can
8864323 i am so pleased with the way you have taken care of my aunt that i will now grant the next three wishes
8864324 i wish i were on a tropical island beach with single well built men feeding me fruit and tending to my every need

8864329 we would have ideally liked that this matter be handed over to the cbi because those responsible should get justice immediately as judicial probe takes longer time
8864330 the prime minister in fact spoke to the chief minister and the governor and assured the state government it would give whatever help needed to bring back normalcy
8864331 senseless destruction by individuals belonging to a particular organisation shall not be tolerated
8864332 we are trying to deal with the protesters as gently as possible we are persuading them to leave the compound and will not do anything to those who follow the court order
8864333 move in and circle around me we cant let them seize our stage too easily
8864334 they have sat down to stop vehicles moving in and out of the phuket airport
8864335 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations
8864336 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8864337 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8864338 the citizens of kirkuk have a saying that the blessing of oil has become a curse
8864339 oil has destroyed our land oil has changed the demographics even now we feel there is an injustice done to kirkuk because of oil
8864340 it is probably the most delicate and potentially explosive issue in iraq
8864341 what the kurds want the arabs dont what the arabs want the kurds dont and the turkomans dont really agree with either side
8864342 we cannot get jobs our families are displaced and those who speak out get kidnapped killed or arrested
8864343 the kurdish parties have hurt us in a way that is unprecedented in history
8864344 all the money is taken by baghdad and spent on cities across iraq but kirkuk is at the end of the list we only get the smoke dirt and occupation of the land
8864345 what is the use of living on a sea of oil if it does not improve my life
8864346 going by the excellent performance of the team to the 2008 olympic games we hope this incentive will spur our paralympians to excel in their respective sports disciplines at the beijing special olympics
8864347 we must maintain a competitive edge and venture into swimming volleyball and gymnastics among others to get more medals
8864348 you could not have brought smiles to kenyans at a better time when all though it was all doom
8864349 we cheered you as kenyans and not as individuals from different communities that is how united kenya was during the olympics
8864350 i promised medals before departure and that the athletes were going to do much better than they did in athens it is a fitting performance for an athlete who is in the twilight of his career
8864351 support by the government and the corporate world was awesome we need more
8864352 i may get a big cheque but what about the coaches and officials they should also be rewarded
8864353 it is time we put the interest of athletes first before our personal ones whenever we have a function we hardly consult the athletes i urge you not to make a decision without consulting athletes
8864354 lets all work together we went through a lot of difficulties to the athletes the country is looking at you focus on the future
8864355 we planned well the secret was good practice in the sweltering heat of athi river ngong and ruiru it helped because the athletes did not suffer the effects of the weather in beijing
8864356 i would continue coaching if ak retains me but for the moment it is good to have brought back smiles on the faces of kenyans
8864357 our boxers also tries the techniques have changed we need more disciplines and athletes in the field events
8864358 it was wonderful and satisfying we missed some medals but there is always another chance
8864359 i told her she could close on the athlete who was ahead and responded well but it was late
8864360 in beijing momanyi did not respond to training well and we could not take a gamble in kenya you can get good results from any of the top 10 athletes which is a difficult call for a coach
8864361 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in inter ethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8864362 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8864363 we have serious grounds to think that there were us citizens right in the combat zone
8864364 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8864365 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of us president
8864366 and if it didnt work out they could always put the blame on us make us look like the enemy and against the background of this surge of patriotism once more rally the country around a particular political force
8864367 it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8864368 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8864369 vores klare indtryk er at hverken den afghanske h r eller de afghanske sikkerhedsstyrker lever op til de internationale forpligtelser for behandling af fanger
8864370 en likvidering som den vi nu har set taler sit eget tydelige sprog om at de afghanske styrker ikke er klar der skal meget mere uddannelse til f r de kan tage ansvar for at overholde konventionerne og leve op til deres ansvar for fanger

8864373 radomir antic es amigo de nuestra familia y sabemos bien cu l es su opini n acerca de las cualidades futbol sticas de mi hijo no hemos hablado de su deseo de que bojan juegue con serbia pero seguro lo haremos en cuanto nos veamos
8864374 antic es un gran entrenador y la persona ideal para llevar a serbia a un mundial no hay duda de que espa a cuenta con bojan quien pas por todas sus selecciones inferiores

8864379 richard foster has done well there so ive told jared he wont come in straight away but hes in the squad
8864380 foster was probably our best player against ayr in the co operative insurance cup
8864381 its a position lee mair and stuart duff can play but they are better elsewhere
8864382 richard foster has done well there so ive told jared he wont come in straight away but hes in the squad
8864383 foster was probably our best player against ayr in the co operative insurance cup
8864384 one day your luck will run out and then we will have to perform really well to win
8864385 of course if we play like that in the group stages of the champions league we will be in danger of not progressing
8864386 we all know what happened last year in the group stages and we just want to improve as quickly as possible
8864387 the response to the festival has been unbelievable i think we could have staged a week long festival with the amount of acts who have applied to be part of it

8864391 it could be either by direct dna damage or by other pathways such as a result of radiation induced genomic instability
8864392 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need
8864393 barack obama will bring down health care costs and at long last deliver affordable accessible health care for all
8864394 weve had a lot of flooding in isolated neighbourhoods people with anywhere from 6 inches 15 cm to 4 feet 1 2 metres of water in their homes
8864395 weve had just under 1 000 homes impacted by the flooding weve had to rescue people in boats and airboats
8864396 were getting beat on and beat on and beat on its still over us
8864397 this storm is turning into a serious catastrophic flooding event particularly in southern brevard county

8864402 eine gro e vereinfachung w re die einf hrung einer einheitlichen niedrigtarifsteuer und eines einheitlichen freibetrages wie aktuell auch von der partei der gr nen in baden w rttemberg vorgeschlagen damit w rden s mtliche erbschaften und schenkungen sofort und in gleicher h he besteuert fristen und auch eine aufteilung in verschiedene steuerklassen w ren berfl ssig
8864403 wenn ein solcher schritt aus politischen gr nden nicht umsetzbar ist so sollten zumindest die steuers tze in den drei steuerklassen auf jeweils einen niedrigen steuersatz pro steuerklasse begrenzt werden nur so kann ein ausgleich zur h heren bewertungsbasis geschaffen werden erg nzend sollten die fristen zur unternehmensfortf hrung und zur lohnsummenbindung auf jeweils 5 jahre verk rzt werden

8864486 have you been saying other men kusaka how dare you when you have generics like us to sleep with
8864487 you generics become entranced by the liangs in front of you but you never plan ahead for a long term relationship
8864488 in the end they had their way with me knowing i wouldnt reciprocate
8864489 england will be a good place for you youll be able to apply all the hard gay skills you have learned
8864490 i dont want it to be just a parody any more yaoi forever
8864491 a man shouldnt be proud of his skin only his liang
8864492 of course i am well trained in the art of the sword
8864493 when i was young i would have hard gay with anyone so i am not in as perfect condition as you might like
8864494 oh yes i was usually the one who took the sword in those days not the one who gave it
8864495 i should have known you wouldnt even give someone sword in exchange for your life
8864496 this time however you must give the sword instead of just taking it
8864497 akizuki i wish you could try the english method of hard gay
8864498 i long to plunge my arrow into your waiting target
8864499 if you die i cannot have regular hard gay with you
8864500 kusaka i have longed for hard gay with you for so long please relieve my frustrations
8864501 ill be with you in a moment just let me give quick sword to this generic
8864502 i was wrong to try to build a relationship with another woman sachiko is all i need
8864503 im sure youve realised by now that that girl isnt right for you
8864504 i on the other hand am all the woman youll ever need
8864505 it may seem that i am only using you for sex but there is more to it than that
8864506 even if you were to change your identity i would find you and bring you back to my side
8864507 ive told everyone that the punishment for trying to have straight with you will be harsh
8864508 to be honest anyone who did have straight would probably be too embarrassed to come back to school afterwards
8864509 if you dont want panda let me have it instead
8864510 no way what panda and i share is something special
8864511 and maybe some make up then we could have a really kinky cosplay session
8864512 well well have to make do with dressing you up as your brother
8864513 yumi i know i will be called on for bi in this situation but i can manage
8864514 after your efforts last episode im actually quite interested in trying bi on this scale
8864515 you should be able to have quite intense bi without breaking this chair
8864516 ill stay with onee sama and help her with the bi
8864517 im in trousers so no one can easily take advantage of me
8864518 arent you scared of the sheer volume of men to be serviced
8864519 im scared they may be too rowdy for me to cope with
8864520 you can manage it onee sama especially if i hold your hand
8864521 forward men this may be our only chance for straight in a long time
8864522 theyre happy to be getting their first straight in a while
8864523 yumi has been away from me for more than five minutes its possible she has found a new lover
8864524 now obey my orders and go and look for her i am a more important character than you are after all
8864525 wait a second this is a girl we wanted hard gay bondage with yuuki
8864526 to cut a long story short we honestly thought that taking him against his will was a good way to get recognition and status
8864527 you weirdoes dont deserve screen time take me back to onee sama now
8864528 we cant let her go now it will mark us as lower than the average generic
8864529 i was just having hard gay with these guys to pass the time
8864530 anyway the important thing is that yumi is safe although she has become one with panda
8864531 onee sama i had too much panda and i actually turned into one
8864532 i dont know if you can still love what i have become
8864533 yumi i already told you that no matter what form you take you will always be my sex slave

8864540 weve got two bids on the table for strikers two for defenders and one for a midfielder at the moment
8864541 if one falls in place then that automatically takes out two or possible three
8864542 were working hard behind the scenes to get players in but you can only do your own bit as has been highlighted by the manchester united tottenham berbatov scenario
8864543 you can only do as much as you can and then get someone else to say yes to it
8864544 weve got bids on the table and if those players become available at the other end then hopefully they will become hull city players
8864545 im less optimistic so well carry on ive no idea whats going on

8864624 intercambio de informaci n para una mayor operatividad en la regi n de la araucan a fue el objetivo de la reuni n de seguridad que convoc el ministerio del interior y que tuvo la participaci n de la polic a civil carabineros la agencia nacional de inteligencia y un representante del fiscal nacional sabas chahu n quien no estuvo presente
8864625 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
8864626 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
8864627 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales
8864628 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8864629 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
8864630 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
8864631 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
8864632 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8864633 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8864634 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8864635 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8864636 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8864637 yo en repetidas oportunidades he dicho que estoy en contra del proyecto pascua lama no por revolver el gallinero sino simplemente por motivos de humanidad y tambi n por el lado del evangelio de jes s
8864638 afecta la seguridad del ecosistema del valle del huasco por el riesgo de la contaminaci n a pesar de los largos estudios que dicen seg n las autoridades regionales que est n cubiertos todos los posibles flancos de riesgo
8864639 siempre caben preocupaciones a futuro por lo que puede significar un error como ha pasado en otros proyectos como celco en chile y tambi n en otros pa ses de am rica latina
8864640 el agua dada la trascendencia que tiene para la vida humana el agua realmente est dentro de la categor a de los derechos humanos
8864641 comprobamos c mo los recursos naturales son extra dos y contaminados por el ego smo de algunos de intereses de grupos de poder amparados por el actual modelo econ mico en perjuicio de los pobres los campesinos y los ind genas un cuidado especial merece el recurso del agua que empieza a ser escaso convirti ndose en el mediano plazo en fuente de conflictos en el mundo
8864642 ticamente es para nosotros inaceptable sea el proyecto en s mismo que planea construir cinco mega centrales en ays n y consideramos inaceptable la postura del estado frente a estas situaciones que se han ido dando con incluso apoyos p blicos de algunos ministros previo a la presentaci n del proyecto de impacto ambiental
8864643 se plantea un cuestionamiento sereno ya que desde la tica y la espiritualidad surgen una serie de elementos que llevados a la pr ctica nos platean en qu sociedad estamos viviendo como por ejemplo qu modelo econ mico nos rige y qu efecto tiene en las actitudes y vida de cada uno de nosotros y tambi n plantea una pol tica de estado sobre la relaci n social y el ambiente en que vivimos
8864644 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n

8864650 de modo incomprensible el gobierno se demor m s de 90 d as en dar respuesta a la huelga de hambre de patricia troncoso que la prensa tambi n acall
8864651 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece
8864652 neruda sol a viajar desde temuco a puerto saavedra pues all un colono de apellido winter le prestaba libros en ese tiempo el poeta escribi sus primeras obras los borradores de los veinte poemas de amor pero en todos ellos no hay un solo indio neruda no los vio y eso que en puerto saavedra no hay m s que arena olas y mapuches
8864653 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
8864654 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo
8864655 esta es una vieja historia cargada de decepci n y frustraciones
8864656 no hay museo m s chic en chile que el museo de arte precolombino
8864657 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
8864658 nunca los ej rcitos chileno y argentino han demostrado mayor grado de cooperaci n y fraternidad que durante la pacificaci n de la araucan a que los argentinos conocen como
8864659 nosotros reconocemos en los mapuches a nuestros ancestros pero andar pregonando que uno ha matado al padre es feo
8864660 si ese fondo no hubiera existido acota bengoa hoy el problema ser a inmanejable
8864661 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
8864662 el primer gran desaf o que enfrent la conadi fue pronunciarse respecto del proyecto de construcci n de la central hidroel ctrica ralco que requer a aprobar la permuta de terrenos ind genas como los delegados del presidente en dicha organizaci n votaron en contra frei los cambi as la conadi perdi su legitimidad cuando se estrenaba en sociedad
8864663 el informe qued archivado en alg n escritorio en la moneda de donde no volvi a salir
8864664 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
8864665 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
8864666 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
8864667 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
8864668 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

8864676 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial
8864677 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8864678 esta situaci n se alan sucede porque carabineros act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche

8864680 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche que result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta situaci n desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8864681 emplazamos al general de carabineros de la ix regi n a que informe objetivamente sobre el origen de los balines que afectan a su personal
8864682 muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche
8864683 quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia y amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las armas de fuego en contra de los comuneros mapuches
8864684 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos
8864685 ante el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios
8864686 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen

8864694 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia
8864695 no muy presente en los libros pero si muy viva en la memoria oral de nuestro pueblo

8864701 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches

8864730 whos out of control whose life is out of control give me a break going from place to place being dragged around by samantha so she can make more money off of lindsay being there when she spins samantha is one of the biggest problems in her life
8864731 no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8864732 you have to be happy i just want you to be happy
8864733 i think it happens more organically simply because our movies tend to be smaller for reason of budget so they kind of force you into a domestic setting
8864734 were also very interested in the metaphorical sense of family with our multiculturalism what can we tolerate should someone wear a burqa is it okay to carry a kirpan were constantly talking about our national family so maybe thats a piece of it too

8864752 they will have the same marriage rights as other inmates they will be able to marry non inmates but barred from marrying other inmates in prison
8864753 for instance suppose a prisoner finds out another prisoner has money or other assets they might find themselves coerced into a marriage with a more powerful inmate who might try to lay claim to half their assets
8864754 the law requires they treat people the same so thats a good principle to have in mind when they are drafting regulations
8864755 does this mean were not going to hear the titanic song
8864756 we will be expanding to 15 more cities in the near future but that will take us more than six months globally we will be launching our services in dubai and london in the next four months
8864757 we take this very seriously and we are working with the machine manufacturer to determine the cause of the problem to ensure that this doesnt happen again
8864758 if it does work out well it will probably be a small plus for us
8864759 obviously if it doesnt work out well then the republicans are going to have a problem
8864760 its more of a problem if youre the guy living in the eye of the storm
8864761 our concern is for the lives in the storms potential path
8864762 this is not about politics its about people and doing whats right

8864789 well see what happens but were in good shape the gap in the championship is big but well keep fighting until its over
8864790 we had a great result at misano last year and that added to the fact that were in good shape with the set up and the tyres means we can be reasonably confident of another good result here
8864791 im really excited to be going to misano in such good shape and leading the championship
8864792 last year the race was a huge disappointment for us a very low point of the season and especially sad because it happened in front of my home fans
8864793 but this time things are very different weve had two fantastic races in a row and we are feeling very strong and very confident we are out to make up for 2007
8864794 misano is so close to my home town of tavullia that i know there will be an army of italian fans there and i hope its going to be a great party for all of them
8864795 last year there was some terrible weather before the race as well so i really hope that this year we have sunshine and we can enjoy a fantastic race by the sea
8864796 i am hoping that we can have a better weekend at misano though i had bad luck there last year another rider knocked me off at the very first corner
8864797 today i felt nervous at the beginning and then it went away
8864798 i am not thinking about anything right now just enjoying the moment
8864799 this is very disappointing to me but something i have to accept
8864800 she played a lot better than i expected she served very well
8864801 i did well i had to come back in third set from down 3 0 in games so i am happy with the victory
8864802 i am happy to be in the third round for me this is a very important tournament
8864803 he is a good player i am going to have to play better to beat him
8864804 not too many long rallies but i am serving well
8864805 i better be ready that girl is a tough cookie
8864806 i tried to go to the net more often because he was using the slice a lot
8864807 there was no need for more talks since there was a deal already on the table that was waiting to be signed
8864808 on last friday morning we had a report of a dead whale on the south coast and we speculated that it could possibly be the mum and we would be doing dna testing
8864809 at sea you cant tell what gender the whale is but when it washed ashore it was clear it was a male
8864810 it was really exciting and i was a bit nervous when i gave her the certificate
8864811 i am delighted to have had the opportunity to find out more about how the alannah and madeline foundation initiatives work and to talk about our programs at the mary foundation
8864812 we continue to expect arrears and repossessions to increase for the remainder of the year
8864813 in terms of lending the main area of focus remains buy to let where tenant demand remains strong and rents are rising
8864814 however we plan to reduce mortgage volumes in the second half and into 2009 until more favourable economic conditions return
8864815 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8864816 yes we wrote a letter to the security council in 2003 saying were responsible for the acts of our employees our people but it doesnt mean that we did it in fact
8864817 what can you do without writing that letter you will not be able to get rid of the sanction i admit we played with the words we had to we had to there was no other solution
8864818 i think they the families were very greedy and they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters
8864819 the position with them it was very terrible and it was very materialistic and it was very greedy and they were asking for money and more money and more money and more money
8864820 and they were talking just about money money money money money
8864821 i dont think that poor guy is behind that sophisticated operation im sure that that poor guy is not sophisticated and clever and capable enough to carry out that job
8864822 the libyans have achieved what they want and western commerce has got what it wants too in this many of us feel like pawns
8864823 peters made his decision that he did not seek the leadership of the party
8864824 as ive said before id be very happy if he changes his mind thats his business
8864825 what dr nelson was referring to is that he would be very happy for mr costello to stay on in parliament
8864826 only he can decide if he wants to carry the tag of the greatest prime minister australia never had that was once used for howard
8864827 costello is undeniably the liberal partys best political asset now that howard has gone which is why so much turns on whether he recovers the will to serve which so clearly and understandably wavered in the aftermath of the election
8864828 the dinners been planned for a long time i wouldnt expect him to make any announcements about anything
8864829 their excuse for not engaging with us is not there hes paul mullett gone on leave
8864830 the labor government wont talk to a union of 11 000
8864831 we would like to see working at the football as operational or rostered as part of normal duties and if that is not possible you should get the opportunity to do it as overtime
8864832 if supervisors pressure officers to go to incidents alone that put them in danger or at unnecessary risk they face massive penalties and fines from worksafe inspectors
8864833 the number of police killed or seriously injured through working alone is just ridiculous
8864834 there has never been more police in the force but they are not where they should be in the frontline
8864835 this has been the number one police issue for years people are sick to death of it we are not asking for the earth stars and moon just to sit down with the government and thrash it out
8864836 the vehicle could not enter the gate and exploded when security people fired on it
8864837 expectations for instantaneous results i think are probably a little bit too high
8864838 i came away from the meeting very encouraged that the focus is where it needs to be
8864839 it was really exciting and i was a bit nervous when i gave her the certificate
8864840 i am delighted to have had the opportunity to find out more about how the alannah and madeline foundation initiatives work and to talk about our programs at the mary foundation
8864841 on last friday morning we had a report of a dead whale on the south coast and we speculated that it could possibly be the mum and we would be doing dna testing
8864842 at sea you cant tell what gender the whale is but when it washed ashore it was clear it was a male
8864843 well see what happens but were in good shape the gap in the championship is big but well keep fighting until its over
8864844 we had a great result at misano last year and that added to the fact that were in good shape with the set up and the tyres means we can be reasonably confident of another good result here
8864845 im really excited to be going to misano in such good shape and leading the championship
8864846 last year the race was a huge disappointment for us a very low point of the season and especially sad because it happened in front of my home fans
8864847 but this time things are very different weve had two fantastic races in a row and we are feeling very strong and very confident we are out to make up for 2007
8864848 misano is so close to my home town of tavullia that i know there will be an army of italian fans there and i hope its going to be a great party for all of them
8864849 last year there was some terrible weather before the race as well so i really hope that this year we have sunshine and we can enjoy a fantastic race by the sea
8864850 i am hoping that we can have a better weekend at misano though i had bad luck there last year another rider knocked me off at the very first corner
8864851 peters made his decision that he did not seek the leadership of the party
8864852 as ive said before id be very happy if he changes his mind thats his business
8864853 what dr nelson was referring to is that he would be very happy for mr costello to stay on in parliament
8864854 only he can decide if he wants to carry the tag of the greatest prime minister australia never had that was once used for howard
8864855 costello is undeniably the liberal partys best political asset now that howard has gone which is why so much turns on whether he recovers the will to serve which so clearly and understandably wavered in the aftermath of the election
8864856 the dinners been planned for a long time i wouldnt expect him to make any announcements about anything
8864857 id expect him to come along and everyone there will thank him and thats the purpose of the dinner
8864858 their excuse for not engaging with us is not there hes paul mullett gone on leave

8864865 today i felt nervous at the beginning and then it went away
8864866 i am not thinking about anything right now just enjoying the moment
8864867 this is very disappointing to me but something i have to accept
8864868 she played a lot better than i expected she served very well
8864869 i did well i had to come back in third set from down 3 0 in games so i am happy with the victory
8864870 i am happy to be in the third round for me this is a very important tournament
8864871 he is a good player i am going to have to play better to beat him
8864872 not too many long rallies but i am serving well
8864873 i better be ready that girl is a tough cookie
8864874 i tried to go to the net more often because he was using the slice a lot
8864875 yes we wrote a letter to the security council in 2003 saying were responsible for the acts of our employees our people but it doesnt mean that we did it in fact
8864876 what can you do without writing that letter you will not be able to get rid of the sanction i admit we played with the words we had to we had to there was no other solution
8864877 i think they the families were very greedy and they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters
8864878 the position with them it was very terrible and it was very materialistic and it was very greedy and they were asking for money and more money and more money and more money
8864879 and they were talking just about money money money money money

8864900 the law requires they treat people the same so thats a good principle to have in mind when they are drafting regulations

8864974 it doesnt matter im just going out there and if i can show the eagles something thats good if not hopefully one of those 31 other teams are looking sure i want to be a part of this nobody wants to start over but if i have to go i still want to make a living i have a family to take care of
8864975 ill take my butt back to college and finish up my last semester then try again next year i have a semester left for a communications degree
8864976 you never know exactly whats going on or what theyre thinking
8864977 ive been there myself all you can do is control what you control play hard and let it fall where it may
8864978 it was a bad time you have anger disappointment and uncertainty about whats going to happen
8864979 the hardest part is accepting it and the uncertainty of what youre going to do next
8864980 its really not about cutting its about waiting for that next call
8864981 thats certainly a concern that we have and thats something we want to explore in the interviews
8864982 did they come as slaves or were they knowingly a part of this
8864983 i am pleased to report that our crew did follow procedure soliciting immediate assistance to get to barrys bay from kaladar by the shortest route possible
8864984 it was never our intention to cause you such anxiety and i can only assure you that we have taken measures to further assist our drivers with navigation
8864985 all of our vehicles serving your area are now outfitted with gps systems which will become operational once we have received the pertinent software
8864986 my stress level was high i was upset angry hurt but most of all i felt betrayed
8864987 i trusted my prize possession my ill husband to what i believed was a direct medically managed transfer to the barrys bay hospital
8864988 am i the spouse expected to question details of the transfer how he is going do they know the way what are their credentials
8864989 i sure hope i am doing the right thing by continuing this story
8864990 i dont want leo to be embarrassed in death and i dont want to embarrass myself or the wonderful medical community who took such great care of him
8864991 the number of calories needed to maintain a healthy body weight varies according to age gender weight and activity level but it is generally around 2 000 calories a day for a woman and 2 500 for a man infants need the most calories per pound of body weight due to their rapid development then it falls off for a while during the preteen years then it goes up again in the teenage years when more rapid development takes place after that your metabolism slows and you need fewer calories as you age
8864992 for most people calories should come from the following proportions of the three types of fuels 50 percent carbohydrate 30 percent protein and 20 percent fat
8864993 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
8864994 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
8864995 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
8864996 my husband and i took this class several months before our wedding and highly recommend it to the engaged almost engaged or recently
8864997 just got my boots back the craftsmanship exceeded my expectations they did such an amazing and quick job thank you
8864998 how often are bridges inspected i know that streets in the university circle area are undergoing an overhaul but i am concerned about the bridges especially as i sit under the bridge at the bottom of cedar road daily and look up at the corroded supports
8864999 it looks as if they shaved the curb down to street level the lip for water drainage is still there but the ramp is now accessible no more rolling in the street
8865000 if we are going to go out in our neighbourhood we tend to walk a street or two south
8865001 but the fantastic thing about where we live is that we are in proximity to everything we have a subway at our toes so in under 30 minutes we can be anywhere we need to be
8865002 i feel he loves me rita feels he loves her
8865003 he generally tends to look me in the eyes like he is playing the song for me i mean i humour her but its clearly not even a fight
8865004 he actually does talk to her more than he talks to me so its a losing battle
8865005 but the lounge is just great in general its a really cool setting if you just want to chill out in the evening and watch a good show
8865006 we did a trip to italy two years ago and i think exclusively ate gelato for about two weeks
8865007 so we were very happy to come back and be so close to something that could remind us of our trip
8865008 really extensive beer menu that i cannot take advantage of because i am not a beer person monica is more of a beer person
8865009 so its fun to go there are try something new
8865010 especially on two toonie tuesdays because its 4 its a quaint theatre its kind of the way you imagine theatres were when they first began
8865011 the fun thing about it is it kind of has a tacky feel to it all of the previews were made in the 70s or early 80s and are crackly and grainy
8865012 i think we collectively love the st lawrence market the most in the this area because it reminds us of home
8865013 we love trying new food and experimenting with food and the st lawrence market in my opinion has the best produce in the city and the local vendors provide a really unique shopping experience
8865014 look this is a tea towel with the royal family
8865015 where else could you find a towel with both diana and prince charles
8865016 i mean theyre so happy where they are and have you seen them cock their heads to one side when i talk to them and flutter their wings when i come near and
8865017 i put romulus next to the little ones in that peaceful corner of the garden
8865018 ooh shes so little i didnt expect her to be so small
8865019 shes smaller than we were shes only 2 1 2 pounds we were four pounds
8865020 we were thinking before our bnei mitzvah that it would be more meaningful to give than to get gifts
8865021 the fact that the kids spent time here its really meaningful when it comes back
8865022 id love to continue to do fundraising because you can see how it really makes a difference
8865023 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
8865024 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
8865025 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
8865026 looks like a wood burning oven but has blue flames coming from it
8865027 the best in the country the margherita pizza is so good its enough to make you cry
8865028 sorry but get a life so you had a bad experience you should of told them instead of writing a whiney yelp review talk about passive aggressive
8865029 i wonder whos cooking our food theres no one in the kitchen
8865030 so instead i used a cab and gave him a 10 tip
8865031 i just stuck my stuff together with duct tape and had the boxes ready on the curb
8865032 theyll pretty much take anything in a cab if youre persuasive enough and tip them enough
8865033 well some guy once gave me 140 no kidding on a 40 fare
8865034 i used it for 2 1 2 hours and it cost about 30 bucks
8865035 i didnt want to have the poor thing shaken up on the subway
8865036 for someone like me i have to go all the way to victoria park and eglinton to get the car and then commute back home
8865037 ok i am upping my rating for the following reasons 1 i can always get a seat if i want one 2 music is 90 good which is commendable in

8865141 nosotros vamos a tratar de conocer los motivos del cierre de esas empresas como c mara no sabemos cu les son los motivos debieron haber sido amonestadas con anterioridad pero nos agarr por sorpresa
8865142 hasta el momento no tenemos informaci n eso fue sorpresivo no hay una comunicaci n oficial de las causas se entiende que no tienen condiciones adecuadas pero era permitido que esas emp compraran servicios a otras cl nicas
8865143 se tiene como objetivo dar una cobertura total sin canastas que limiten la atenci n al asegurado y entonces en lugar de entregar dinero a las emp que no dan garant as a los afiliados van a inyectarle ese dinero al minsa para que ellos den la atenci n a los asegurados
8865144 en estos momentos legalmente no pueden hacerle nada primero el judicial que dict sentencia tiene que enviar al caso al juez ejecutor y ste debe citar a cardenal para compelerlo a cumplir la sentencia lo cual podr an hacer la pr xima semana
8865145 la pr xima semana voy a seis universidades norteamericanas a leer poes a y si me van impedir salir del pa s ya voy a avisar a estas universidades lo que sucede en nicaragua conmigo
8865146 esas cosas son verdaderas y todo el mundo lo sabe no s lo nicaragua pero la palabra ladr n no la dije sa es la interpretaci n de algunos periodistas
8865147 amenazas grandes penden sobre el pueblo de nicaragua y aqu ya estamos viendo m s riesgosa y peligrosa la instrumentalizaci n del poder judicial que el uso de un arma de fuego en la calle porque se violenta la seguridad e integridad de las personas y por eso hemos llamado a este gobierno una dictadura institucional
8865148 tengo la conciencia que quien va a sufrir a largo plazo es el pa s por eso hay que romper el cascar n del miedo que es del huevo del diablo y mientras no lo rompamos continuaremos con esta situaci n de gran incertidumbre y que obviamente a nuestro pa s no le conviene
8865149 aqu se inventan y no se necesita tener la mentalidad de un novelista para inventar una causa de cualquier tipo
8865150 nuestra cr tica ya est teniendo repercusiones yo hablo frente al pueblo de nicaragua y tengo mi credibilidad la credibilidad que me ha dado mi carrera de intelectual y literario frente al poder mi actitud como la de ernesto cardenal y gioconda belli tiene consecuencias pero nada de eso me inducir a callar
8865151 eso no puede ser el amor es universal una actitud de perd n de olvido y de entrega a los dem s pero no se puede odiar diciendo que amo no tienen credibilidad miro a la gente en las esquinas con las cruces y creo que est n alquilados mandados me da piedad que a la gente se le use como instrumento y est n ah sin ning n entusiasmo porque est n cumpliendo un mandado pol tico
8865152 no nos toma de sorpresa todav a est fresca en la memoria de todos la decisi n arbitraria de la familia ortega de apropiarse de mi obra igual que somoza pasando por encima de todas las legislaciones nacionales e internacionales de derechos de autor

8865154 la sangre de los m rtires que lucharon en solentiname por la libertad de nicaragua no cay en vano pronto se har justicia y los que hoy atropellan la libertad ser n juzgados

8865162 als entlastung k nnte auch die tochter cominvest mit einem wert von rund 1 5 milliarden euro der allianz als asset tausch angeboten werden
8865163 wichtig sind auch noch weitere details des deals wenn die commerzbank beispielsweise teilweise in aktien zahlt wie lange verpflichtet sich dann die allianz diese zu halten unterdessen k nnte die commerzbank ihrerseits eine risikoabschirmung des versicherers f r die dresdner bank fordern das w re wiederum leicht negativ f r die allianz
8865164 die allianz ist ihr sorgenkind dresdner bank zwar los m sste zun chst aber einen hohen buchverlust ausweisen eine denkbare l sung w re auch gewesen dass die allianz anteilig an dem konstrukt beteiligt bleibt dann w rde es keinen buchverlust geben
8865165 f r die allianz w re es allerdings nur die zweitbeste l sung da die commerzbank den n tigen kaufpreis wohl nicht alleine stemmen kann und der versicherer daher wahrscheinlich mit 20 bis 30 prozent beteiligt bleiben k nnte die allianz h tte mit sicherheit das geld lieber bar in der hand
8865166 neben dem preis wird auch spannend wie viele der altlasten der dresdner bank die allianz noch tr gt

8865210 mccain and republicans wanted to say they had a potential virginia vice president because every state but especially virginia likes to have its ego stroked
8865211 in the grand scheme of things eric cantor has got less executive experience and foreign policy experience than even tim kaine

8865251 never been a man on my own and been able to define myself simply based on me i have never tried picking up a girl at a club or asking for a womans phone number i have never had a one night stand nor have i been rejected by a girl somehow i feel like i am missing out on some important life experiences
8865252 what are the odds of a relationship with my high school sweetheart really working out what if it fails are the risks of what i will lose too great and even if it does work out is it even a good thing am i missing out on too many important life experiences i e dating being with different people and will i hold resentments about missing out that will poison our partnership

8865254 why are men with children from a previous marriage considered ineligible why are men earning less than 70 000 considered ineligible i think the cash level is especially interesting whilst 70k isnt a huge amount of money it is significant i just feel all the so called data out there is as judgmental as the dating environment maybe the data fuels the environment or vice versa
8865255 hristos a trimis nebunia sa prapadeasca intelepciunea slabiciunea ca sa lege taria dispretul ca sa stinga mandria aceasta este taina cea mare a evangheliei el n a venit sa i se slujeasca ci el sa slujeasca si aceasta taina trebuie implinita in toti slujitorii lui pana la a doua sa venire

8865262 its just indescribable its like the dream is being reclaimed
8865263 when you consider the possibility of an african american being elected to the most powerful position in the world its awesome its beyond comprehension
8865264 it cuts across so many lines young people are inspired older people are seeing the america they want to be a part of is here
8865265 it showed that kings message transcended race and appealed to people of good will
8865266 i thought we would have an african american president but not in my lifetime
8865267 i thought of all those who had sacrificed to get to this point
8865268 i thought of oliver hill and sam tucker civil rights pioneers with whom he practiced law and wished they had been alive to witness the event
8865269 coming from here and coming to this point its hard to describe it really is
8865270 the united states is now more dependent on foreign oil than it ever was
8865271 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8865272 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8865273 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
8865274 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
8865275 if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8865276 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve experienced in the history of humankind
8865277 not only in the heat of this election but in the aftermath as we put his agenda to work for our country
8865278 has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
8865279 i just am excited to be fighting for john mccain
8865280 it was one of the most moving wonderful things ive seen
8865281 im going to tell my grandbabies about this i witnessed history
8865282 he told us why america needs change and what hell do to bring that change
8865283 ive been in obamas tour since the beginning of it
8865284 whether its restaurants or street vendors who are selling barack obama paraphernalia
8865285 just for the atmosphere and to meet people from different states
8865286 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision i think well all hear from him shortly and hopefully well be able to move forward together
8865287 the same human activity that has brought freedom and opportunity to billions has also increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere
8865288 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8865289 i am not surprised that its a plank in the platform because thats part of mccains platform but its disappointing because its an example of republicans playing me too rather than leading
8865290 i wouldnt say there has been a shift just within the party the platform has just been designed to reflect the views of the nominee
8865291 there has been a feeling that i have seen among conservatives involved in the platform building that they want to stay as firm as possible finessing the language in a way that will give some ground to senator mccain
8865292 but mccain really continues to be on the losing side of this issue with conservatives
8865293 republicans are committed to meeting the challenge of long term global climate change by relying on markets and new technologies to improve energy efficiency

8865299 when you have monetary tightening you do get lower growth that was expected
8865300 but its not terribly low 7 9 is still high by historical standards
8865301 in the face of good growth and loose fiscal policy i dont expect any relaxation in the central banks tight policy stance even though inflation has moderated slightly
8865302 denn eines kann das internet sicher nicht den rat des arztes oder apothekers ersetzen
8865303 so beginnt etwa eine ganze reihe von krankheiten mit simplen verk hlungssymptomen wie schnupfen oder erh hter temperatur ob das ein relativ harmloser grippaler infekt ist ob sich gerade eine echte grippe entwickelt oder ob sich gar eine schwere bakterielle infektion im k rper ausbreitet muss der arzt beurteilen
8865304 man kann sich leicht vorstellen dass das risiko noch um ein vielfaches h her sein kann wenn es um innere organe wie herz oder niere geht
8865305 das f rdert den auch von den meisten rzten l ngst verfolgten grundsatz einer behandlung nicht nur f r sondern vor allem auch einvernehmlich mit dem patienten und das ist gut so
8865306 das internet als zus tzliche informationsquelle ist auch aus der medizinwelt nicht mehr wegzudenken verwenden sie es aber nur als quelle f r vorinformationen oder als abrundende zusatzinformation und keinesfalls zur selbstdiagnose und selbstbehandlung sprechen sie daher im anlassfall stets mit ihrem arzt bzw dem apotheker denn sie k nnen sich mit einigen minuten oder stunden auf medizinischen webseiten bestimmt kein wissen aneignen f r das ein mediziner oder pharmazeut jahrelang studiert und praktiziert hat
8865307 vielleicht kann man patientinnen auch tipps geben welche seri sen internetseiten sie aufsuchen k nnen wenn sie sich zus tzlich noch n her ber ihre erkrankung oder behandlung informieren wollen eine solche internetseite sollte n mlich weder f r den medizinischen laien zu wissenschaftlich sein noch soll sie zu falschen oder missverst ndlichen informationen f hren wichtig ist also auch welche seiten angesichts des fast un berschaubaren angebotes f r medizinische laien berhaupt empfehlenswert sind

8865312 we looked like drowned rats last night after the downpour outside truro but we soon got dried off
8865313 paralyzed rats are now able to walk because of this research and i believe some day ill walk again and so will anyone who has a spinal cord injury
8865314 when i talk to people along the way and i tell them i actually saw the rats walk after they had this treatment they will sometimes have a tear in their eye
8865315 with this research human paralysis could be a thing of the past ill definitely walk again i know that

8865322 obama claims to be an anti war candidate when he really is just a new face on the war of terror that bush has locked into place
8865323 hes pledged pre emptive war on iran and on pakistan hes not an anti war candidate hes pledged 14 000 more troops to the war in afghanistan and wants to keep 80 000 troops in iraq
8865324 i argued for more resources and troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8865325 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan

8865341 weve been consulting with local authorities across the u k for some months now about removing pay phones that arent really being used and are therefore unprofitable for bt
8865342 some authorities recognized their pay phone was not being used but wanted to keep their traditional red telephone box on the village green for aesthetic reasons because its part of the british heritage
8865343 we had other councils who said they really wanted to maintain a working telephone service plus the box itself
8865344 thats about half the annual cost to bt of maintaining a public pay phone

8865372 i am delighted that swfs sovereign wealth fairies continue to express confidence in the terrific values represented by american financial institutions as i have been saying since august of 2007 this shows that the crisis is now over

8865374 the women in johns early life truly shaped who he became
8865375 and the strengths and weaknesses of their relationships are central to this film
8865376 br nn war eine schlechte erfahrung f r mich und meine crew wir m ssen an der front einfach mehr grip finden nach br nn haben wir michelin reifen getestet aber das brachte auch nichts
8865377 der teamgeist ist nach der gro artigen performance unseres spanischen fahrers wirklich gut
8865378 die schlechten zeiten liegen hinter uns jetzt k nnen wir f r den rest der saison optimistisch sein misano macht wirklich spa im vorjahr war ich siebenter kein schlechtes resultat aber dank meines neu gefundenen gef hls f r die ducati erwarte ich mir diesmal mehr
8865379 f hle ich mich wirklich gut weil ich in der sommerpause viel zeit mit meiner familie verbracht habe da konnte ich gut regenerieren jetzt m chte ich in der weltmeisterschaft noch in die top 10 kommen
8865380 wir alle haben so unsere rivalit ten besonders je n her der chase heranr ckt
8865381 jeder hat eine chance und findet seine eigenen methoden sich daf r zu motivieren gedankenspiele daf r zu durchzugehen oder auf der strecke zu fahren und jemanden dabei einzusch chtern diese sachen sind eben einfach teil des meisterschaftskampfes
8865382 wenn ich mir ansehe was in bristol passiert ist ist eindeutig klar dass sowohl carl als auch kyle wissen was sie zu verlieren haben
8865383 es ist eben racing auf hohem niveau kyle ist nicht gerne von hinten abgeschubst worden aber gleichzeitig war es aus der sicht von carl ein cleverer schachzug und eine sache die geradezu typisch f r bristol ist
8865384 ich denke der wettbewerb wird noch gr er werden man wird sehen dass der druck jeden im chase auf bestm gliche oder schlechteste weise beeinflussen wird aber das wird einfach dazu geh ren
8865385 ich denke dass carl ein wenig lter und reifer ist das soll kyle nicht schm lern aber ich denke dass carl so was schon ein paar mal miterlebt hat ich habe schon immer gesagt dass in der meisterschaft erfahrung sehr wichtig ist und er hat mehr meisterschaften gewonnen und mit hilfe dieses punktesystems w rde carl in meinen augen ein wenig vor kyle stehen
8865386 aber es gibt f r jeden ein erstes mal und kyle hat immerhin dieses jahr schon so manchen rekord gebrochen insofern ist es schwierig zu sagen wer das rennen macht carl scheint ein st ckchen hinterher zu hinken kyle wiederum scheint zu nervosit t zu neigen aber das schm lert weder die chancen des einen noch des anderen
8865387 als ich h rte dass ich diese auszeichnung erhalten werde f hlte ich mich wirklich geehrt
8865388 in die beeindruckende liste der empf nger der tom wheatcroft troph e aufgenommen zu werden ist ein seltenes privileg ich habe nie das regenrennen in donington 1993 vergessen das rennen wurde privat durch tom finanziert der durch seine liebe und den enthusiasmus zum motorsport angetrieben wurde
8865389 es ist eine ehre frank heute die troph e zu berreichen
8865390 alle empf nger der tom wheatcroft troph e haben im sport eine lange geschichte und haben zur industrie einen betr chtlichen beitrag geleistet die troph e ist unser weg um ihnen etwas zur ckzugeben es ist ein herzlicher dank an die leute die den sport zu dem machen was er ist
8865391 ich hatte in neuseeland noch nie einen so guten rhythmus
8865392 die pisten sind schneller abgetrocknet als wir erwartet hatten und auf dem losen schotter war es sehr rutschig aber ich denke nicht dass die startposition zwischen eins und zwei so viel ausmacht morgen bin ich erster auf der stra e das wird auf dem rutschigen schotter nicht so einfach aber ich war schon fter in der position und werde einen weg finden
8865393 obwohl es nur wenig grip gab habe ich so viel wie m glich gepusht wir mussten mit den harten reifen fahren die heute morgen auf dem kalten harten untergrund nicht funktioniert hatten dazu mussten wir stra enkehrer spielen deshalb war es wirklich schwer schnelle zeiten zu fahren
8865394 wir mussten das auto amschieben damit es wieder ansprang und kamen zu sp t zum check
8865395 wir haben alles gegegeben und waren nach ss4 1 bis auf 0 7 sekunden an hirvonen dran leider haben wir danach den motor abgew rgt und haben ihn nicht mehr zum laufen gebracht wir mussten das auto amschieben damit es wieder ansprang und kamen zu sp t zum check
8865396 das hat uns wertvolle zeit gekostet die wir uns morgen zur ckholen m ssen
8865397 ich habe versucht von der st rke unseres autos bestm glich zu profitieren bei den bedingungen bin ich mit dem tag ganz zufrieden wir haben eine gute ausgangslage f r morgen
8865398 ich bin am ende der vorletzten pr fung langsamer gefahren um morgen eine bessere startposition zu haben
8865399 ich bin am ende der vorletzten pr fung langsamer gefahren um morgen eine bessere startposition zu haben es wird ein herausfordernder tag aber ich freue mich schon darauf ich bin froh dass ich mein selbstvertrauen und meinen rhythmus wiedergefunden habe am nachmittag habe ich allerdings nicht mehr ganz so leicht in meinen fahrstil gefunden und habe in der vorletzten pr fung eine b schung gerammt dabei habe ich die vordere sto stange verloren
8865400 wir haben alles gegegeben aber wir sind zu weit weg von der spitze
8865401 la gran misi n que plantea el lanzamiento de esta organizaci n es alcanzar el poder en las pr ximas elecciones generales con una propuesta que tenga como objetivo central regenerar el estado dominicano
8865402 devolver el poder que le han quitado al pueblo los politiqueros
8865403 you know this country of ours has more wealth than any nation but thats not what makes us rich we have the most powerful military on earth but thats not what makes us strong our universities and our culture are the envy of the world but thats not what keeps the world coming to our shores
8865404 instead it is that american spirit that american promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend
8865405 and it is that promise that 45 years ago today brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream
8865406 the men and women who gathered there couldve heard many things they couldve heard words of anger and discord they couldve been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred
8865407 but what the people heard instead people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8865408 we cannot walk alone the preacher cried and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8865409 america we cannot turn back not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess

8865416 im enjoying it for what it is im absolutely honored and for it to come this late in my career it really gives me a special appreciation for it you know that old saying good things come to those who wait and though ive been working hard but not towards that particular goal this i something to show that my work ethics have been acknowledge and im very humbled by it
8865417 its an acknowledgement that i dont take lightly the fine actors in the same category that im in are actors whose work ive respected over the years so im proud to be amongst my peers ones that i respect as well
8865418 i dont know if there is any mysticism or mystery to it its a combination of a couple of things desire loving what i do and then just outright stubbornness i have a strong desire to be in this business i love the fans and the work and the opportunity to express myself when you come across those obstacles that any person in their right mind would say hey who needs this i guess i just have a stubborn streak that says im going to buck this and i look up and 50 years later here i am ive been blessed to be able to feed my family and raise my kids and do the best i could by them doing something that i love to do
8865419 i wish i could say it was by some inner strength that i was able to say no to mediocre jobs but that is in fact not the case in many instances i would have sold my soul for a job these were the cards that were dealt me and after a while it seemed as though the parts that came to me were parts that had that kind of integrity to them i dont know if my reputation over the years garnered that or if thats just the way the cards played out sometimes the price for the great roles in between is very severe in terms of trying to put food on the table at the same time when you look over the long stretch it does make me feel good that ive been a part of so many projects that people really respect and really feel strongly toward that my name can be associated with them i dont know how that happened
8865420 i do want to win the award im not one of those actors that say oh that doesnt mean anything im competitive by nature i rodeo and compete in the rodeo circuit so you must know that i have a competitive nature somewhere in there so of course i want to win but at the same time ive been in the business a long time and i know that thats not always the case i know what has happened and i take that with me the fact that i will now be always known as an emmy nominee to have that on my resume and to be introduced in the future as emmy nominated actor glenn turman is something that cannot be taken away from me that attached to my signature is a win that has put me in a category of those who have that honor attached to their name and im very very pleased to have that now if i should win i certainly hope that my managers and my team are able to turn that into both financial and further work but thats a part of the business its show business
8865421 youre talking about a movie that im really proud to have my name attached to it to have my name a part of this movie that has classic written all over it kings of the evening written by robert and andrew jones im honored that this film has been made about the human spirit told through four characters in a boarding house led by a wonderful cast including tyson beckford lynn whitfield reginald t dorsey who also produces the film and james russo its a film set during the depression but managing to capture that time the triumph of what the human spirit can overcome the character of clarence symbolizes the spirit of the time in terms of what it is to hit up against a wall that will not crumble a wall designed to defeat you a system designed to make you feel less than what youre worth a world that gives you glimpse of what hope is and then holds it out as a carrot that dangle in front of you hes as they all are are trying to reach that carrot hes come to the end of his rope it seems unattainable it was his ever trying to get to that carrot that drew me to his character you see the dimmer of light slowly fading from his eyes those elements are always challenging to play for an actor and if youre able to achieve that its very artistically rewarding feeling and thats what i was growing for people seem to think ive achieved some measure of success in doing it

8865423 como consecuencia de la sequ a y los altos precios de alimentos vemos casi una duplicaci n del n mero de personas que necesita alimento eso representa un aumento de 7 millones de personas s lo en lo que va del a o
8865424 cuando se obtiene la cosecha muy insuficiente pueden prever que no les alcanzar para la cosecha siguiente y entonces venden un buey el dinero obtenido de la venta s lo les alcanza para cubrir algunos meses debido a los altos precios de alimentos pero cuando empieza la estaci n de las lluvias ya no disponen de un animal para arar el campo as se van superponiendo los problemas por la falta de alimentos se debilitan sus hijos est n desnutridos y carecen de los recursos para poder trabajar la tierra adecuadamente para la cosecha siguiente
8865425 en 2006 el precio de los fertilizantes se hab a duplicado al igual que el a o anterior por ello no pudimos comprar la cantidad suficiente y la cosecha rindi menos demasiado poco para alimentar a mi familia en algunos meses se nos agotaron las reservas buscamos trabajo como peones en empresas agr colas grandes pero por los altos precios de los fertilizantes tambi n estas empresas obtuvieron una producci n menor a la esperada por lo tanto hab a menos necesidad de mano de obra y los sueldos eran muy bajos encima de todo estaba la sequ a en febrero y marzo podemos cosechar generalmente los tradicionales cultivos de primera necesidad sobre todo papas salvajes pero este a o se hab an marchitado por las sequ a la consecuencia fue una grave escasez de alimentos lo que provoc mucha desnutrici n y enfermedades sobre todo en los ni os muchos de ellos han tenido que acudir a los centros de atenci n sanitaria y alimentaria
8865426 un enorme desaf o quiz s el mayor que su organizaci n haya conocido hemos hecho un llamado especial para recibir fondos este a o y la respuesta de los donantes ha sido generosa probablemente se deba a que reconocen la influencia de los crecientes precios de alimentos y combustibles estos fondos s lo iban a ser dedicados a cubrir los costos adicionales

8865437 it was a temendous experience being involved in a full time set up for two weeks and essendon couldnt have treated me bettter
8865438 but after giving the matter a lot of thought ive decided that id prefer to playing gaelic football rather than making the change to aussie rules which has many stoppages for marks when players catch the ball cleanly
8865439 i have been able to have some pretty cool things happen over the last ten days
8865440 it is kind of hard to really take everything and fully experience everything but hopefully after all this is done i will be able to sit down and really think about everything ive had the opportunity to do
8865441 our commitment to building a new world class lfc stadium is undiminished
8865442 like many other major development projects in the uk and overseas we are affected by global market conditions and as such work on the project will be delayed in the short term
8865443 well see after the fight on how i feel if this fight will be my last fight or not
8865444 lets just say my foot got caught in the door
8865445 a matchup between the two most popular fighters on the planet would be unbelievable and when i think about places of course wembley stadium comes to mind or in mexico the famous azteca stadium
8865446 i think the big thing is to feel that you are wanted by your club your manager your team mates and the fans
8865447 it was a big disappointment for the fans to see what happened during the summer
8865448 ade is a big big player and last year he showed he has the quality to be one of the best in europe so of course we are behind him
8865449 it is difficult of course for the fans but i am sure if he starts scoring goals and by december is on 15 or 20 then everything will be fine
8865450 i think he showed he is a great player william is the captain so you have to look for someone to blame
8865451 unfortunately it is him but i dont think the players think that is right
8865452 we dont blame him for everything everyone makes mistakes everyone is behind him and it will remain like this
8865453 i heard a few clubs were interested but sunderland didnt want to sell
8865454 it was the hardest decision of my career i had a chat with roy keane and he didnt want me to go and tried to convince me to stay
8865455 i also met roy hodgson and spoke to roy met fulham and the team and decided i liked it already
8865456 i wanted to go to fulham ive been out for six months and want to move on and play and be closer to my family in london
8865457 i want to thank roy keane for giving me a chance to play in the premier league its been a dream come true for me
8865458 i want to come home to london as i grew up here but last year was great and i loved sunderland and the fans are the greatest ive had so far it was a great pleasure playing for them
8865459 roy keane wanted me to stay and im proud to have two managers wanting me
8865460 the deal is going to be wrapped up some time today
8865461 i know for a fact it was abramovich who bought shaun
8865462 so there was a problem between him and mourinho from the start and then grant came in and he took on the baton and shaun still didnt get a look in
8865463 how do you think i felt looking at him at the champions league final and hes in a suit
8865464 but if you look at it in the figures in the long run were going to be paying that anyway
8865465 its a big initial expense but 10 15 years from now wed say this is the greatest thing we ever did
8865466 if you look at it that expense is not going away in seven years so in seven years it could benefit us
8865467 we could get to the point to where we are totally solar
8865468 we have talked about that our building is old so we dont have the duct work
8865469 we have a boiler system there would have to be some structural changes in the building in order to do that
8865470 it would be a nice pilot project for county buildings
8865471 eventually if we are looking at going green it might be a cost savings in the long run
8865472 it also benefits the home because those windows were extremely heavy
8865473 the headline to this should be crafty wooster knocks off knights jade craycraft was tremendous
8865474 those are the type of things you practice every day
8865475 they jumped on us in that fourth game because we didnt put any pressure on them
8865476 when you play good teams you have to pressure them you cant just sit back at times we played really well tonight i definitely cant fault the effort
8865477 early in the season its part of a learning process
8865478 youre going to have peaks and valleys we have a tendency right now to lose focus when things are going well we did that some tonight but im proud of the way we responded
8865479 getting the two things separated to the appropriate place they kind of got blurred
8865480 planning commission members do have some authority to reject it based on not conforming to surrounding architecture
8865481 some authority to approve or deny based upon the new buildings context with the neighboring buildings
8865482 i believe the building conforms to the architectural criteria of our codes and therefore should not be an issue for denial
8865483 i stated and still believe that the commission does not have the authority to reject the proposed building based upon location of the door or roof planes
8865484 we will be prepared on the 16th at the board meeting to make a recommendation
8865485 when were done with this were essentially going to be on schedule
8865486 three consecutive years our construction management company has turned over a new building in june
8865487 wants very much to build a functional and attractive building
8865488 revenues were down and donors were down at portage square plaza
8865489 in 20 years goodwill will own its own building and will be able to put new money into services
8865490 hopefully well be more efficient with electric and all those other expenses as well
8865491 we saw the decline in portage square plaza and weve been trying to find a location for more than four years
8865492 nothing seemed to work out there was no vacant land that can be zoned for the space we need
8865493 we feel pretty confident our revenue predictions will hold for four to five years this was studied very thoroughly its not a knee jerk reaction
8865494 it was a great team win everybody played very well it finally felt good to get that first win of the year
8865495 when youre playing against teams like ashland you have to have a physical presence on the field and we did not have a very big physical presence
8865496 we knew that they lost some seniors last year but nevertheless if you have a good senior team you always have time to groom a younger group behind them thats what they have they have a very talented group
8865497 our passing was very well our defense was very well offense was finally hitting the corners and getting us some goals
8865498 its always exciting when you make those kinds of goals
8865499 my coaches just tell me when i get it look for a shot first touch and i saw that i had it open i dont really try to chip it its just that it happened to chip
8865500 our team is definitely getting better and playing as a team we have a lot of new players
8865501 were finally starting to get some experience playing with each other
8865502 we lost nine starters and replacing nine starters is very difficult and were just finally starting to click with each other and know where we all are out on the field
8865503 we played with a lot of heart and you could see that
8865504 they did not give up played through the whole game never put their heads down thats what counts
8865505 i think this is the best waynedale team weve played since i started coaching
8865506 playing them on the road made it even more of a tough match for us i knew it was going to be a hard fought battle
8865507 we were standing on pins and needles there for the last 15 minutes
8865508 obviously they out played us in the second half but i think we did a nice job of containing them
8865509 it felt really good to help us get on the board first
8865510 i saw adkins come up a little bit and i thought it wasnt going to go in i just had a lucky bounce
8865511 it was really important to get the goal before halftime
8865512 it was a great shot by jeremy i thought it was a very even game it was a good push by us at the end but i wouldve liked the game to go the other way
8865513 offensively we havent started off too bad we have to do a better job of making the last pass
8865514 through the midfield we keep it short pretty well our last penetrating pass isnt quite there yet were just a little inconsistent but its early in the season i think well be able to get that timing down
8865515 adkins did a nice job for us considering hes a four day old keeper
8865516 with a little more experience in there we might have stopped one of those goals its hard to go in there after just four days
8865517 there she was the victim of a rape perpetrated by an individual who is now being sought
8865518 v r koncernchef har naturligtvis sin syn p hur f retaget ska styras och f ljas upp och det f r f ljder l ngre ned i organisationen
8865519 de r med och bejakar processen det r deras service det handlar om men annars r de inte med p n got s tt
8865520 det finns inget som s ger att det kommer att bli s det finns bara teser om hur vi ska ka effektiviteten
8865521 det har varit v ldigt f reaktioner s h r l ngt men det har ocks berott p att vi har haft v ldigt lite att informera om den information som g r ut i dag r v ldigt luftig men det r den information som finns det finns ingen dold agenda bakom
8865522 det r precis den balansg ngen som r s sv r vi vet inte var spekulationerna g r samtidigt m ste vi informera om att det h r arbetet p g r
8865523 det vi redan vet r att vi ska inf ra en ny organisation fr n den 1 januari d m ste man vara psykologisk och inte g ra det efter jul det ska vara i god tid f re jul s det inte blir n gra hemska julklappar
8865524 det har varit fullst ndigt juste tycker jag so far so good
8865525 i think dr king would have been proud to have witnessed tonights events
8865526 no place in my mind or im sure his would we have imagined seeing so many people of all type of backgrounds rallying behind someone like us who had been denied full participation for so long
8865527 the walls that king and obama are trying to tear down are much different
8865528 king was trying to tear down the walls of injustice obama is trying to build walls of opportunity
8865529 he couldnt mention martin he couldnt mention the he couldnt mention those who sacrificed and gave so much its very very difficult to actually create a new world if you dont acknowledge the world from which you are emerging
8865530 if we were being true to kings dream wed be talking about poverty how to eradicate it and the long list of things that mattered to him
8865531 i just fear that his legacy will get glossed over
8865532 for most americans august 28 1963 was the dream speech day and for them its like a happy day
8865533 that is a one dimensional view of the risk and terror of that day
8865534 the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation
8865535 has given the negro people a bad check a check that has come back marked insufficient funds but we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt we refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation
8865536 i feel that he truly does offer hope for this nation for all americans not some americans all americans
8865537 why not go play one of the perennial powerhouses every year and really see where you measure up
8865538 last year we were playing well early we lost a couple of guys to injury and we didnt react well to that adversity
8865539 a lot of people say theres a lot of unknowns with what were going to do well theres a lot of unknowns any time you play a first game theyve had all summer and spring practice and fall camp to add a few things in there
8865540 youve got to be very quick to adapt in your first game more than any other game that concerns you when you have some inexperience but at the same time everybodys going through it
8865541 oh well if youre going to play in the champions league you might as well come up against the
8865542 you have to be honest about it and say this is an even stronger manchester united than the manchester united we faced two years ago
8865543 this time they are champions of europe and champions of england they are a better team now and that will make our job even harder
8865544 itll be hard to top last season but it wont be hard to be me just work hard every day at practice every time i get a chance to and hopefully ill do better than last year
8865545 i want to win ive never won a championship so thats one thing i really want to do
8865546 if playing his four years are good enough for jerry rice its pretty much good enough for anybody
8865547 will it be next year will it be in a couple of years
8865548 i dont know that but hes going to have to make that decision at the end of the season
8865549 we have so many weapons we feel teams are going to have trouble defending us
8865550 i dont think anyones going to be able to just prepare for crab
8865551 if they focus on me then they will have a problem
8865552 well probably beat them by 70 if they do that they need to focus on tech
8865553 i tell my buddies who play golf its like youre going out to play pga golfers phil mickelson or tiger woods head to head
8865554 you want to go up there do well win some battles
8865555 you dont want to go up there and just have them run roughshod on you thats not good that wouldnt be good
8865556 on the way to the stadium i dont know ill probably be a little overwhelmed
8865557 and when you look at the tapes of them theyve got some awfully good athletes
8865558 im careful about including groups that may be seen as having an agenda other than spirituality
8865559 us foreign policy is akin to government sponsored terrorism these days it was not a mistake that there was a huge security stand down on september 11 last year i am solo i will continue to disrupt at the highest levels
8865560 intentional and calculated to influence and affect the us government by intimidation and coercion
8865561 what i did was illegal and wrong and i accept i should be punished but i am not a member of al qaeda i believe my case is being treated so seriously because theyre scared of what ive seen im living in a surreal nutters film
8865562 the reason i left not just one note but multiple notes on multiple desk tops was to say look this is ridiculous
8865563 he is terrified by the prospect of going to america
8865564 zeus met a lot of hot chicks at those things
8865565 he doesnt remember baracks mom per se you know what im sayin
8865566 even as the teachers in my school extolled the virtues of a multiracial society i keenly felt caught in the invisible strands of racism
8865567 thankfully as a god i could use my bionic heat vision to melt those strands
8865568 all the other sons and daughters of zeus were riding the zephyrs on ten speed thunder bikes
8865569 and heracles and i had to bi locate to the store it was humiliating
8865570 these mortal political offices and the presidency are just trifles
8865571 i have been to the mount olympus top and ive seen the promised land
8865572 following arkagas regrettable decision to renege on its written undertaking to guarantee all liabilities arising at cork city investment fc ltd until january 2009 the club entered into examinership on august 18
8865573 the fai has already expressed its displeasure at arkagas actions which have placed the club in the difficult position it currently finds itself
8865574 the fai met this morning with the examiner appointed to cork city investment fc ltd
8865575 a meeting of the independent club licensing committee was convened tonight and they deducted ten points from cork city fc for being involved in an examinership process as per section 3 1 2 of the club licensing manual
8865576 this sanction is effective immediately the committee was keen to express that it is imperative for all clubs to adhere to sound financial policies

8865587 the vehicle could not enter the gate and exploded when security people fired on it
8865588 expectations for instantaneous results i think are probably a little bit too high
8865589 i came away from the meeting very encouraged that the focus is where it needs to be
8865590 theres a lot of space for shrapnel to pass through
8865591 even if you remove 30 percent of the webs the tire will still work
8865592 the army research lab approached us saying that flats on humvees made them susceptible to attack
8865593 we looked at a lot of non pneumatic designs before coming up with a polymeric web
8865594 it is one of the additional options open to us to muzzle our dogs ans get them to use a headbutt
8865595 it is legitimate for the people of pakistan to ask whether that story is true or not and what is his response because so far neither the nor mr zardari has responded
8865596 i would humbly request him that he should withdraw his candidature in the supreme national interest in the interest of democratic stability and also in the interest of the future prospects of his party
8865597 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision i think well all hear from him shortly and hopefully well be able to move forward together

8865603 we need the centre to be operational so as to help our youths as most of then are commercial motorcyclists we have not seen anything there the centre is not properly used the youths are agitating to take over the land if the government is not ready to utilize it since the area has been over grown with bush
8865604 we are here to know what plans the minister has for the centre

8865608 banking sector as one of the most strategic important sectors that have direct socioeconomic impact on the lives and business of average citizens needs protection from cyber criminality considering the huge amount of funds lost in that sector annually
8865609 some of the rampant cyber corrupt practices in the banking sector include online financial fraud inside out identity theft system penetration by outsiders data and network sabotage and denial of service attacks
8865610 the quantum effect of the emerging monstrous challenge of cyber crime to developing economies translates into a colossal digital nightmare to african and indeed particularly to nigeria
8865611 national security remains perhaps the most critical and mandatory imperatives for actualizing sustainable national development and global peace
8865612 hola papi te cuento pues mi experiencia en la carretera se que no soy muy buena escribiendo jejeje mi especialidad es otra cosa as que tu que eres experto espero me perdones mis errores y dem s sale
8865613 but the fallacy of the headline is that there is a direct competition between the two that its either or the reality is that strong global economic growth has changed the demand equation for u s commodities this information begins at 1 10 in the podcast
8865614 were seeing ourselves at a unique point in history where a lot of these factors have collided at the same time to create this food vs fuel debate
8865615 the pace is heating up on finding sustainable alternatives to these energies and biofuels really are at the forefront of the debate
8865616 farmers profitability doesnt change retail prices and farmers profitability isnt guaranteed by high grain prices the same factors that are lifting grain prices are lifting production costs
8865617 so yes the farm price index is at 162 percent of what it was 1990 1992 but at the same time the price index measuring what farmers pay for services farm wages is 189 percent of base
8865618 the future in this debate with the new administration coming in will be like a ride on a bi plane it will be bumpy but fascinating as well

8865624 it was an archaic way of rating plants that was not logical
8865625 part of the concern was that this information it was available to the public it was indeed causing our members some grief
8865626 industry would prefer a single set of standards for both the canadian and american market
8865627 the cmc will also express their frustration about the recent united states department of agriculture imposition of product testing for listeria monocytogenes and of daily visits in u s eligible meat processing plants
8865628 the cfia is working at bilateral levels to convince the usda that its system is equivalent to theirs in order to minimize the need for extra import rules
8865629 there are some additional requirements that may come into play in relation to export certification of products
8865630 we focus on a single level of hygiene and safety for all consumers of products produced in canada
8865631 the cfia does not agree with this usda approach and disagrees with a number of specific usda requirements e g daily visits finished product testing for listeria monocytogenes but it has implemented the required changes to maintain canadas access to the important u s market the cfia will only be successful in convincing the usda to return to previous arrangements if canadian operators can demonstrate that they are operating in full compliance with all usda rules
8865632 the canadian meat council has sought changes to the existing system because ratings and reports are used by the media through the access to information act and there is a misperception that products coming from a b or marginally acceptable facility are less safe
8865633 i had one case a lady of baby boomer age and she helped her daughter move all day then she went to lift that last box of dishes out of the trunk and nope stuck she couldnt straighten up
8865634 i can see it around queens now its kind of actually hilarious
8865635 he was about 6 foot 3 and she was about 5 2
8865636 theyve got her on one end just straining to lift this thing and him on the other end sweating all down his spine
8865637 its all about a straight back and using your thighs and dont go past your capacity
8865638 move in day is painful enough psychologically you dont need to come home with a broken back
8865639 they want to parent their kids they want to share that experience
8865640 this is a chance to show their love and perhaps their authority
8865641 we draw from found footage because it influences really great characters real people not actors
8865642 its about normal people caught in weird situations we try to make something more real and subtle
8865643 its not a conscious thing its hard when youre in the foxhole
8865644 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision i think well all hear from him shortly and hopefully well be able to move forward together
8865645 i think dr king would have been proud to have witnessed tonights events
8865646 no place in my mind or im sure his would we have imagined seeing so many people of all type of backgrounds rallying behind someone like us who had been denied full participation for so long
8865647 the walls that king and obama are trying to tear down are much different
8865648 king was trying to tear down the walls of injustice obama is trying to build walls of opportunity
8865649 he couldnt mention martin he couldnt mention the civil rights movement he couldnt mention those who sacrificed and gave so much its very very difficult to actually create a new world if you dont acknowledge the world from which you are emerging
8865650 if we were being true to kings dream wed be talking about poverty how to eradicate it and the long list of things that mattered to him
8865651 i just fear that his legacy will get glossed over
8865652 for most americans august 28 1963 was the dream speech day and for them its like a happy day
8865653 that is a one dimensional view of the risk and terror of that day

8865662 if it does work out well it will probably be a small plus for us
8865663 obviously if it doesnt work out well then the republicans are going to have a problem
8865664 its more of a problem if youre the guy living in the eye of the storm
8865665 our concern is for the lives in the storms potential path
8865666 this is not about politics its about people and doing whats right
8865667 come on guys be statesmen and use this as an opportunity to educate the public about how important it is to fully fund firefighters to educate the public and to be prepared
8865668 listen to the guy thats been on the mountaintop and listen to the guy thats been down into the valley of you know where nothing worked and listen to what i have to say
8865669 m let r att r ttf rdiga georgiens aggressiva handlingar
8865670 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
8865671 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
8865672 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
8865673 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
8865674 i say they will certainly be suggested certain countries have already asked that sanctions be imposed
8865675 an audit of eu russia relations to ensure that on each and every aspect of our relationship what we are giving russia is worth what we are receiving in return
8865676 i highly doubt that might ever happen but hypothetically speaking that would be to the detriment of the european union as much if not more than to russia
8865677 yes i expect the negotiations to continue and i do not possess any information to the contrary there was a statement from the commission yesterday 27 august that they are proceeding from the same assumption hopefully the leaders of the eu will not make a different decision on monday i certainly hope that reason and common sense will prevail
8865678 in case it comes to that we will choose kosovo we will not abandon kosovo that is our message
8865679 we do not expect this new development to have a negative effect on us
8865680 it is difficult to do something at national level if you want to tackle this issue you have to tackle it in the eu legislation this is what the commission will consider in the weeks to come
8865681 cost of data roaming is still very high for many consumers
8865682 the further reduction of the eurotariff on 30 august will reaffirm the trend for lower roaming prices
8865683 the next challenge is now to bring about a single market for roaming text messages and data services i count on the french presidency and on the european parliament to help the commission solve this problem very soon
8865684 would risk further erosion of competitive differentiation in the market
8865685 billing increments are a point of differentiation that operators can use to appeal to customers with different preferences
8865686 we are very much in favour of sms caps sms is a mature market where prices are not decreasing
8865687 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
8865688 almost 700 of the maximum amounts of pesticide in fruit and vegetables allowed throughout the eu are too high
8865689 failed to deliver on its obligation to set legal limits at the lowest achievable level
8865690 there is also no consideration of the cumulative effects that pesticides have on human health legal action is now necessary to force the commission to think again
8865691 for each pesticide the commission identified the country with the worst safety limit and then sought to adopt this level as the new eu wide standard
8865692 to threaten acute and chronic damage to health especially that of children
8865693 he is not in the intensive care unit he is in a reserved room
8865694 whenever news like this comes out all tibetans inside and outside tibet remain concerned it is a matter of concern for the future of tibet
8865695 we reject the policies that the government wants to impose through a decree
8865696 doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8865697 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8865698 and if it didnt work out they could always put the blame on us make us look like the enemy and against the background of this surge of patriotism once more rally the country around a particular political force
8865699 in the growing standoff with the west russia is practically alone
8865700 in a restrained manner and without recognizing south ossetia and abkhazia they did side with their partner
8865701 it is time to establish the truth about the crimes committed before and during russias invasion of georgia
8865702 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8865703 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
8865704 bold solutions and optimistic vision for our nation and our childrens future
8865705 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8865706 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8865707 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8865708 people of every creed and color from every walk of life
8865709 is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8865710 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8865711 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8865712 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8865713 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8865714 the republicans are going to have their turn and theyll have a whole lot of fun with us and they will change some minds and persuade and then the race is on
8865715 were going to have to work as hard as we can
8865716 we are excited to continue to work with some of the leading consumer electronics manufacturers and announce fantastic products with dolby technologies
8865717 at ifa well be demonstrating momentum for our technologies across a range of different platforms and devices in broadcast consumer electronics pc gaming and mobile sectors
8865718 it was on the back of strong economic fundamentals as well as increased domestic demand
8865719 although the nation will be somewhat affected by global developments the government is confident that malaysias economy will continue to remain stable with a gdp growth of 5 7 per cent this year
8865720 we would have liked ideally that this matter be handed over to the cbi because those responsible should get justice immediately as judicial probe takes longer time
8865721 the prime minister in fact spoke to the chief minister and the governor and assured the state government it would give whatever help needed to bring back normalcy
8865722 senseless destruction by individuals belonging to a particular organisation shall not be tolerated
8865723 after i used it for three days all of my acne dried up and went away many people believe in it
8865724 it is very effective some people dont believe in it but people who do really get a good result
8865725 after that my friends who work at garment factories in phnom penh advised me to apply the lubricant from number one plus condoms on my face every night
8865726 and just within three to four nights the acne on my face gradually and then totally disappeared
8865727 public toilets in delhi an emphasis on the facilities for women in slum areas
8865728 a man has options but a woman cant urinate in the open as that is deemed uncultured the issue of public toilets affects women the most especially poor women
8865729 people talk about feminism all the time but nobody thinks of a need as basic as a toilet for them despite the fact that our chief minister and mayor are both women
8865730 we are preparing ourselves for the commonwealth games and its horrible that the citys civic agencies do not even perform their basic duties its a violation of the rights of citizens especially women who have no option but to defecate in the open
8865731 one day during my internship with ccs i saw a woman cleaning a public toilet at yusuf sarai it struck me that though she was cleaning the toilet she herself couldnt use it since it was meant only for men like most public toilets in delhi i decided to find out the real status of public conveniences in the city
8865732 in the indian context its sad but true that an ideal woman is one with a dress a smile and a vagina no one cares to look at the number of pipes and organs in her body that are there to give birth to a life and that she needs a hygienic toilet
8865733 officials from the slum department of the mcd said the norm in slum areas is one latrine seat for 150 people and a 20 20 20 latrine seats for men and 20 latrine seats for women for a plot meant for 500 households
8865734 the mcd should make it mandatory for companies who show interest in constructing repairing and maintaining toilets on a bot basis in lucrative areas to also do the same in slum and resettlement areas
8865735 pay and use toilet facilities for women can work as a policy for slum areas every adult can make a one time deposit of rs 100 towards the maintenance fund for the constructed public toilet
8865736 the commencement of our new drilling campaign within the shallow fields production unit at the mtsare khevi field has progressed very well and we are encouraged by the results and efficient pace of our early work in this new development program as drilling continues our rolling development plan calls for these shallow wells to be completed and brought into production as quickly as possible in order to ramp up production from the field as it represents an important near term value component within our overall portfolio
8865737 this investment is another step in our plan to expand keys international business the russian market is one of the fastest growing oilfield services markets in the world and we are excited to enter this partnership with a well respected service company like geostream this companys management under the leadership of dr boris levin has many years of oil and gas industry experience is well known in the russian oilfield services industry and its client list includes both russian and international oil amp gas companies dr levins prior success with u s investors in this market gives us great confidence that we have found the right partner for our expansion into the eastern hemisphere
8865738 the aussie has generally pushed up higher in the last couple of domestic sessions only to come back down through the overnight session off the back of us data

8865744 we remind the company that having set an example with mike carlton it may need to sack all the undersigned if it insists on this course of action
8865745 we believe the company hires columnists on the basis that they have principles it is wrong to sack them for the same reason
8865746 mike is not a member of the sydney morning herald staff
8865747 its not a half decent product its a very decent product its as normal
8865748 well reserve our rights on all of that and well make decisions as things evolve

8865830 we used to drink at the prince of wales in sandown a third of my mates and my mum still live on the island
8865831 we had a 1960s wedding with all the music from the 1960s all the girls dressed in minis and all the lads in 1960s suits everyone really went to town
8865832 this was a real shock obviously no one was expecting it
8865833 they had been on the island for about three weeks before the accident and spent a lot of time at the club marcus was a promising young sailor and a lovely boy who was very popular
8865834 they did not live down here but they took an active role in the club
8865835 they were a very popular family and our thoughts go out to them
8865836 we have identified some issues as a result of recent system tests which we are working urgently to address
8865837 there were clear indications in february of significant security concerns with this database only now with just weeks to go until the project is supposed to go live have they finally agreed to pull back to try to iron out some of the problems ministers now need to come clean and confirm whether this delay is because childrens personal information is at risk
8865838 i think theyve lost the plot what are they doing where are they going whats happening i dont get it any more they lost me i still appreciate what theyre doing or what theyre trying to do but i think theyre trying too hard not to be radiohead that seems a little ridiculous to me
8865839 i like them as a rock band all the buttons and sequencing and stuff like that i dont really care for im a fan of rock music and what theyre doing now i dont think is very good when you have that kind of money you can put on a great performance regardless of what you do if you cant go out and pick up your instruments and play a good show that doesnt do it for me i dont have any interest in that
8865840 to me what i would like to hear from radiohead would be something besides a feeling i would like it if radiohead would sing something that you could take with you
8865841 you can go through the whole new radiohead album and try and tell me what theyre saying and all youll get over and over again is things are miserable dont try things suck and its all gray theres nothing there
8865842 if you cant go out and pick up your instruments and play a good show that doesnt do it for me
8865843 you can go through the whole new radiohead album and try and tell me what theyre saying and all youll get over and over again is things are miserable dont try things suck and its all gray theres nothing there
8865844 its not a very musical way of looking at things to sieve it for meaning its more about feeling it isnt it if you write lyrics intending for a set meaning to come across its not art its just a rant the best lyrics come from a particular moment when youve written a piece of music or youve learned a new way to play or do something with sound
8865845 you can go through the whole new radiohead album and try and tell me what theyre saying and all youll get over and over again is things are miserable dont try things suck

8865882 no place in my mind or im sure his would we have imagined seeing so many people of all type of backgrounds rallying behind someone like us who had been denied full participation for so long
8865883 the walls that king and obama are trying to tear down are much different
8865884 king was trying to tear down the walls of injustice obama is trying to build walls of opportunity
8865885 he couldnt mention martin he couldnt mention the civil rights movement he couldnt mention those who sacrificed and gave so much its very very difficult to actually create a new world if you dont acknowledge the world from which you are emerging

8866324 we were told that we can only cook outside the camp which is about 200 kilometres away
8866325 they indicated that the system of buying food from the restaurant is very costly considering the salaries that we get one spends about p690 on food per month which weighs heavily on a worker earning p800
8866326 it is very unfair to be charged for something that can be handled by the management
8866327 workers are not forced to stay in the camp and we provide transport for those residing outside
8866328 on august 7 under the leadership of our chief executive officer we appeared for a review before the permanent secretary and other ministry officials
8866329 when he khama ascended to office he unreservedly announced that he was going to give executive officers six months to prove their worth
8866330 i would like to however call upon the honourable councillors and staff members to work hand in hand to improve on financial management
8866331 let me take this time to mention that city of francistown has been given an amount of p11 720 865 being a provision to cater for maintenance of roads that were damaged by the rain
8866332 this is a commendable exercise which i trust will be of great importance to our development
8866333 the pmtct programme which has been very effective in terms of reducing the number of children born with hiv suffered from shortage of the formula which is a replacement of breast milk
8866334 this a serious threat to the programme particularly to those mothers who cannot afford to buy formula or long life milk because they will be inclined to breastfeed to prevent their babies from dying of starvation
8866335 the council has been relying on sourcing from local suppliers who do not stock drugs but wait for orders which they purchase from manufacturers particularly in south africa
8866336 i do not have a docket yet but i heard from my officers that they did attend to such a case in phakalane i do not have a file here maybe the investigators are still to deliver it to me
8866337 i heard that the two people were music producers but i do not have names and as such i cannot say we have any case that we are investigating until i have all the facts with me
8866338 the police were called in but they found there was no such threat to kill
8866339 we had a misunderstanding and i told chilly to leave my house i think because it was at night he felt the police would help him i was fed up and wanted him out of the house then
8866340 he pointed a pellet gun at me and the police have confiscated it because they confirmed that it could kill if the victim is shot at close range on tuesday morning around four in the morning tex knocked on my door and demanded a certain cd while i was still trying to figure out what he was saying he started kicking the door and broke into my bedroom and together with deben they started assaulting me and he tex brought a gun and threatened to kill me
8866341 things went sour after i started insisting that we need to have records in the company to manage cash flow
8866342 at the end of last season you could see that we were organised we have signed new players young and experienced we want the experienced players to provide guidance
8866343 the signs of a good season are there our target is to do well during the first round of the league and this would lessen pressure going into the second round
8866344 our aim is to move away from the third division and then we will take it from there we are not saying the second division is much different from the third but it is better to move a notch up
8866345 i am preparing for the start of the new icl season this year and so far no one has told me not to practice here
8866346 there was never any ban on shabbir ahmed to practice he is only banned from representing pakistan in tests and odis and from first class cricket
8866347 he is a pakistani and we have no objection in his practicing at nca
8866348 any player who has represented pakistan can practice here but that does not mean we are thinking about changing our policy on the icl it remains the same when the icc recognises it we will also adopt a softer line
8866349 something we inherited when buying the delhi group of companies in 2006
8866350 it doesnt affect the cash position it tells you nothing about the underlying profitability of the company he said
8866351 oil and gas opportunities for a company of beachs size and abilities still abound but not all are in australia he said
8866352 still the oiliest part of the world as well as considering prospects in new zealand spain albania and tanzania
8866353 weve also got a very big program coming up offshore victoria tasmania he said
8866354 weve got two rigs soon to be operating in the basker manta field and another rig lined up to drill three wells offshore victoria tasmania all within the next six months so well be busy
8866355 this is being treated as arson and until we can determine whether the family was inside it will remain arson

8866366 weil georgien einer gut geplanten und zeitlich perfekt organisierten russischen provokation zum opfer gefallen ist ist es ja wohl unwahrscheinlich dass es jemand f r n tig hielt einer nicht existierenden operationsstrategie einen namen zu geben
8866367 die russen haben auf dem boden gesiegt aber nicht in den medien
8866368 unsere aufgabe ist es die kommunikation zwischen der russischen regierung und internationalen journalisten zu erleichtern sowie offenheit transparenz und zug nglichkeit zu den weltweiten medienvertretern zu verbessern

8866372 the marathon mercilessly rips off the outer layer of our defenses and leaves the raw human vulnerable and naked it is here you get an honest glimpse into the soul of an individual every insecurity and character flaw is open and on display for all the world to see no communication is ever more real no expression ever more honest there is nothing left to hide behind the marathon is the great equalizer every movement every word spoken and unspoken is radiant truth the veil has been obliterated these are the profound moments of human interaction that i live for
8866373 running is not fun its too hard to be fun even the most devoted runners would not describe the experience of performing a typical workout let alone competing in a race as fun im not saying running doesnt feel good it does feel good in a way that any form of hard work feels good to those who have a taste for it a hard run leaves you exhausted and glad to be done with it some days you dread even starting a run but the overall running experience just feels right like an expression of who you really are
8866374 running teaches you that theres a difference between working hard and feeling bad consumer culture tries to teach us otherwise how many television commercials talk about making life easier but its just not true challenging and testing your mind and body even to the point of exhaustion failure and breakdown can feel as wonderful as anything else life has to offer
8866375 every runner has the potential for mental toughness somewhere inside whenever runners allow suffering to defeat them and consequently fail to do their best it is not because they lack mental toughness but because for some reason they just didnt have the courage that day to access it
8866376 the aussie has generally pushed up higher in the last couple of domestic sessions only to come back down through the overnight session off the back of us data

8866378 the battered financial sector found some traction today climbing 2 per cent as traders covered their short positions pushing macquarie bank up over 4 per cent
8866379 its a confluence of these two circumstances which makes it an increased risk
8866380 the reason why they are the least likely to have done something to prevent identity theft is that they havent considered the consequences of having their identity stolen
8866381 for those of us with mortgages and credit cards and mobile phones etc it is easy for us to conceptualise what will happen if someone steals our identity and the drama that will cause in our lives
8866382 compiling a fraudulent id is like putting together a jigsaw and displaying the pieces of your life online is not a good idea
8866383 a fraudster is looking for any information they can get their hands on to compile an identity about you
8866384 recycling bins and unguarded mail are a key source of information for fraudsters
8866385 people who have experienced identity theft have talked about how its taken quite some time to clear their name which is very unfortunate because they are a victim of crime
8866386 it was so great to be part of this competition and see the whole fhs team come together strengthen their leadership skills and network with others interested in the same areas

8866391 we remind the company that having set an example with mike carlton it may need to sack all the undersigned if it insists on this course of action
8866392 we believe the company hires columnists on the basis that they have principles it is wrong to sack them for the same reason
8866393 mike is not a member of the sydney morning herald staff

8866398 the key task for policy makers going forward is to ensure that older people can increasingly play an active role in our ageing society
8866399 additionally the challenges of an ageing society means that the government must now grasp the nettle of reform to the social care system with real urgency
8866400 in employment these figures clearly show the economic harm that will be caused to uk plc by continuing to exclude older people from the active workforce
8866401 changes to our population are inevitable over time an ageing society is a fact of life which should be welcomed and embraced not treated with concern these new figures should give everyone pause for thought about our future

8866403 some insured patients are being asked by hospitals to pay larger portions of their bills upfront and sometimes hospitals will not do the procedures until they get their copayments
8866404 can be withheld depending on a patients ability to pay
8866405 as the economy worsens employers are having a harder time affording insurance for their employees theyre increasing the patient portions and patients benefits actually decrease

8866407 primary health care which integrates health in all of governments policies is the best framework for doing so
8866408 central to the commissions recommendations is creating the conditions for people to be empowered to have freedom to lead flourishing lives
8866409 following our recommendations would dramatically improve the health and life chances of billions of people
8866410 we rely too much on medical interventions as a way of increasing life expectancy
8866411 a more effective way of increasing life expectancy and improving health would be for every government policy and programme to be assessed for its impact on health and health equity to make health and health equity a marker for government performance
8866412 after 3 years of gathering evidence the commission on social determinants of health has performed an invaluable service in making the health case for a fairer society it is a case that deserves the full support of health professionals and policymakers in all countries at last equity is taking its rightful place at the centre of public debate about health the commissions report is a fitting tribute to dr j w lee whos late director general who initially commissioned this brave project

8866414 this guidance recommends two particular measures which help to prevent ventilator associated pneumonia and which are simple to implement nursing patients with their upper body elevated is already very common practice and use of oral antiseptics fits readily into the regular care of the upper airway it is important to emphasize that this was not intended to be a comprehensive guideline there are many other measures which may contribute to reducing the risk of vap for example there was evidence to support the use of systemic decontamination of the digestive tract sdd but many specialists in the uk have concerns about the possibility of more infections by multi resistant bacteria if this were used routinely the guidance gives specific recommendations for further research to increase our knowledge of sdd in the context of uk practice
8866415 evidence suggests that ventilator associated pneumonia is a significant patient safety problem and can lead to further serious complications this important guidance recommends actions that will help improve the situation and help reduce the risk of pneumonia in patients who are on a ventilator

8866466 formally we are going to write a letter to the facilitator south africann president thabo mbeki about the breaches that have occurred
8866467 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently

8866478 seriously threaten our quality of life particularly that of the most vulnerable people
8866479 we need to concentrate efforts to slash carbon emissions and become more energy efficient in order to prevent dangerous climate change
8866480 but we also need to prepare for how our climate is expected to change in the future
8866481 it is traumatic enough for patients and their families to have to come into our department without them having to contend with cramped out of date facilities

8866488 and we know he is not ready for that i cant see it it is too important for capello and for england
8866489 it is not a serious injury but it is a frustrating one and very irritating for the player

8866515 i realise that i am not the likeliest candidates for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8866516 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8866517 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8866518 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8866519 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 chance on change
8866520 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook
8866521 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag
8866522 they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8866523 the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
8866524 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8866525 made clear we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8866526 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8866527 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home

8866531 2 hogsnots with the works and a couple a boilermakers
8866532 that was a good finish to what has been a very good preseason for us
8866533 we got a lot of things accomplished that we wanted to get accomplished tonight we felt that it was necessary to get some no huddle offense in with our first offense inside stadiums in the preseason that is a weapon that we like to use offensively so we needed to get that done we got a couple of series of that we wanted the defense to come out and get after the run again and build upon the performance that we had last week i thought that we did a nice job against the run
8866534 i called a lot of runs on purpose because i wanted to get them out there and they wanted to run the ball so i think they did a great job
8866535 we went to our no huddle package tonight it wasnt good thats why i wanted to practice it in the preseason we had a couple of mistakes but im glad we got it done now
8866536 im pretty upset actually because i snapped it too early on the third play of the game
8866537 i shut down a drive we had a few errors with the no huddle offense that wed like to have back but thats why we have practice
8866538 i think we still have a lot of room to improve
8866539 overall ill give us a b minus i want us to go out and dominate people i want us to go out and play three plays and come sit on the bench and watch the offense but we had bad field position and we held them to a field goal and thats a plus
8866540 we want to make sure we can make plays and get our offense the ball back
8866541 the fans can see us up close and personal and see our whole team its fun to connect with our fans
8866542 you know its time to go when we have this luncheon its time to gear up and rock and roll we are excited about this year we have a good team were excited about where we are going and about this team
8866543 its always going to be like that to be a part of that still being far removed from playing makes it all that more special its always great to be around the fans
8866544 on game day i am in the parking lot getting ready to enjoy the game you get a chance to see it from the other side i can see why the fans cant wait for the season to start its such a great time just seeing these people enjoy themselves and they cant wait to see the steelers play
8866545 what changed my perspective more than anything was winning the super bowl and the parade
8866546 after that i had a different perspective on how much our fans love us any time i get an opportunity to go out and give back to them i do its nice hearing the compliments i guess that makes you feel good more than anything its a way to say thank you to them
8866547 although camp signifies the start of the football season this starts the regular season
8866548 the energy and excitement that is in this ballroom having the players and coaches and fans and sponsors means that it starts for real and there is an excitement about it
8866549 you are excited its a new cycle of life its a new team there are new elements what adversities await them what challenges do they have to overcome who is going to emerge as the new hottest young thing who is going to have the breakout year its always exciting every year
8866550 there has been a lot of talk about our schedule being one of the toughest in the league but a lot of those games will be at heinz field we are looking forward to our fans being there and being loud and helping to make a difference
8866551 we appreciate the bond and relationship we have with our sponsors fans and this community
8866552 events such as this represent that relationship we dont take anything for granted
8866553 we are working extremely hard to make everyone proud and to pursue a championship for the steelers nation i thank everyone for their excitement and hope we keep everyone on the edge of our seats we look forward to a great season in 08
8866554 its tough to know that i am going to miss out on this special year with this group of guys

8866632 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8866633 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8866634 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8866635 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8866636 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8866637 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8866638 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8866639 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8866640 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience

8866659 das h tte auch niemand gedacht vorher wenn man sagt ich schreib einen roman ber einen typen der in kreuzberg in einer kneipe arbeitet sich in eine frau verliebt das wird nix sein freund wird irre und dann f llt die mauer das ist jetzt nicht gerade eine geschichte bei der man sagen w rde das wird ein garantierter bestseller
8866660 letztendlich geh rte zum leben in westberlin nat rlich auch eine gewisse verdr ngungsleistung was die mauer betrifft
8866661 und nur manchmal macht man sich das klar zum beispiel wenn der frank mit dem wolli auf das ger st steigt und mal r berguckt und wirklich erstaunt ist wie das aussieht ich glaube das war ganz wichtig f r die jungen leute die da hinkamen man nahm das irgendwie hin verdr ngte das aber gleichzeitig hatte das auch so einen seltsamen perversen charme das darf man nicht vergessen

8866668 its a novel and highly scalable approach that creates valuable communications channels from large user bases by matching their criteria and profile data to form affinity groups this enables organizations to leverage their databases increase the effectiveness of communication for their clients and improve their behavioral targeting
8866669 from a user perspective it simplifies the process of exchanging information with nearby or like minded people
8866670 ocean tomo is extremely excited to offer this lot from such a dynamic industry in the fall auction the early priority date before the real boom of social networking and location aware mobile devices as well as its innovative methods for connecting like minded users makes it an extremely valuable asset to own
8866671 we are pleased that this stay was granted by the faas top attorney and believe that it shows that the slot auction faces a host of serious legal difficulties
8866672 with this order at least for the time being the faa avoids other litigation that it could not have won
8866673 the protesters have demonstrated compelling reasons to maintain the status quo
8866674 dont be fooled glaxosmithklines scare tactics are only concerned with protecting its profit not the health of people with hiv aids

8866677 theyre more or less fighting for market share at this point
8866678 one of the classic examples of that would be the pepsi challenge
8866679 from my perspective this is the way that gsk has always kind of handled things in the past
8866680 their modus operandi is always kind of to bash the competition and they do that in a number of ways
8866681 running jaws ads is just going to raise the anxiety level very high for people nervous about getting treatment this could put them over the edge

8866687 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to suspend all zoom operations it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8866688 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8866689 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying even late today we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying having been unable to complete the investment package the directors of zoom had no option but to instigate administration proceedings

8866695 in international cricket you shouldnt take anything for granted and bangladesh is a good example of that because as soon as we did they gave our backsides a kick
8866696 so our bowlers will have to be on the mark and i guess our batters especially if the conditions do move around which im assuming they will with a 9 30 start
8866697 the ball might move around a little bit so if we end up batting first i think our batters are going to have to switch on at the start as well
8866698 every batsman around the world has the same area of weakness
8866699 if you can bowl consistently in the good spots then you are going to compete and thats our challenge to our bowlers to be consistent int their lengths and their lines and bowl to their fields
8866700 there is no secrets in the world about where to bowl to players its been the same for 150 years
8866701 we always talk about the fact that we have a win here we have a win there
8866702 were trying to be more consistently competitive snatching a win here and snatching a win there is not what im about in the future its about being consistent
8866703 coming to australia and everyone knowing that we can be competitive not asking do you think you might win a game
8866704 how many games are you going to win is what i want people to ask

8866738 well probably get a few new customers but we are not banking on a big windfall
8866739 this all started because we asked our customers what they liked about our stores and what they didnt like
8866740 more cosmetic changes like changing signs and names are creative but dont address that more fundamental problem of competitive pricing
8866741 it is just not like the state stores when i grew up they are very well run well prepared
8866742 yes we wrote a letter to the security council in 2003 saying were responsible for the acts of our employees our people but it doesnt mean that we did it in fact
8866743 what can you do without writing that letter you will not be able to get rid of the sanction i admit we played with the words we had to we had to there was no other solution
8866744 i think they the families were very greedy and they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters
8866745 the position with them it was very terrible and it was very materialistic and it was very greedy and they were asking for money and more money and more money and more money

8866752 well see what happens but were in good shape the gap in the championship is big but well keep fighting until its over
8866753 we had a great result at misano last year and that added to the fact that were in good shape with the set up and the tyres means we can be reasonably confident of another good result here
8866754 im really excited to be going to misano in such good shape and leading the championship
8866755 last year the race was a huge disappointment for us a very low point of the season and especially sad because it happened in front of my home fans
8866756 but this time things are very different weve had two fantastic races in a row and we are feeling very strong and very confident we are out to make up for 2007
8866757 misano is so close to my home town of tavullia that i know there will be an army of italian fans there and i hope its going to be a great party for all of them
8866758 last year there was some terrible weather before the race as well so i really hope that this year we have sunshine and we can enjoy a fantastic race by the sea

8866820 we had to do it for the fans because i think everyone is agreed that the fulham game was not the way we play
8866821 sometimes you cant play your game but its the way you behave on the pitch and the fans have always been there for us since the first day i came to arsenal
8866822 it was a really big blow and we felt sorry about it but now it has passed and we have to do the right thing for the fans
8866823 when you play in english football you know that any team you play is going to be a tough game
8866824 for a club like arsenal we have to be at the top and to be at the top you have to play with the right spirit so thats what we tried to do last night and we showed with the players we have got if everyone is playing the same way we can have a great result
8866825 we have to maintain it premier league games are different to champions league with respect to twente newcastle will be a different side and we know it is always tough to play against them

8866837 das ist alarmierend und einen anlass die bem hungen auf allen ebenen zu verst rken
8866838 was aber mittelfristig gebraucht wird ist ein eigener unterrichtsgegenstand gesundheitslehre den lehrer und schul rzte gemeinsam bestreiten und eine aufstockung der zahl der schul rzte damit sie pr senz und aktionen verst rken k nnen
8866839 die m dchen deren raucheranteil in sterreich stark w chst lassen sich etwa von der vorstellung leiten durch die zigarette schlank zu bleiben das ist aber erwiesenerma en falsch studien haben das l ngst widerlegt
8866840 nur wenige wissen dass zigaretten etwa geschmacksstoffe oder menthol beigemischt werden damit rauchen auch f r junge leute attraktiv wird

8866847 in vielen nachfolgestaaten der sowjetunion wie etwa in der ukraine leben au erordentlich gro e russische bev lkerungsgruppen daher ist es mehr als verst ndlich dass sich der kreml f r diese russischen volksgruppen in besonderer weise verantwortlich f hlt

8866849 bei den baltischen staaten oder polen kann man erhebliche zweifel haben ob es sich um mitgliedstaaten der eu oder um bundesstaaten der usa handelt und es ist abzulehnen wenn sich manche mitgliedstaaten offen in den dienst der vereinigten staaten stellen versuchen die nato osterweiterung zur zur ckdr ngung russlands voranzutreiben und damit den interessen europas schaden

8866860 the outsourcing trend is a salutary one for our globalized economy
8866861 outsourcing affords lawyers the ability to reduce their costs and often the costs to the client
8866862 there is nothing unethical about a lawyer outsourcing legal and non legal services provided the outsourcing lawyer renders legal services to the client with the legal knowledge skill thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation
8866863 at a minimum a lawyer outsourcing services should consider conducting reference checks and investigating the background of the lawyer or nonlawyer providing the services as well as any non lawyer intermediary involved
8866864 in some instances it may be prudent to pay a personal visit to the intermediarys facility regardless of its location or the difficulty of travel to get a first hand sense of its operation
8866865 when engaging lawyers trained in a foreign country the outsourcing lawyer should first assess whether the system of legal education is comparable to that of the united states
8866866 the lack of rigorous training or effective lawyer discipline does not mean that individuals from that nation cannot be engaged to work on a particular project what it does mean is that it will be more important than ever for the outsourcing lawyer to scrutinize the work of the foreign lawyers

8866876 denn eines kann das internet sicher nicht den rat des arztes oder apothekers ersetzen
8866877 so beginnt etwa eine ganze reihe von krankheiten mit simplen verk hlungssymptomen wie schnupfen oder erh hter temperatur ob das ein relativ harmloser grippaler infekt ist ob sich gerade eine echte grippe entwickelt oder ob sich gar eine schwere bakterielle infektion im k rper ausbreitet muss der arzt beurteilen
8866878 man kann sich leicht vorstellen dass das risiko noch um ein vielfaches h her sein kann wenn es um innere organe wie herz oder niere geht
8866879 das f rdert den auch von den meisten rzten l ngst verfolgten grundsatz einer behandlung nicht nur f r sondern vor allem auch einvernehmlich mit dem patienten und das ist gut so
8866880 das internet als zus tzliche informationsquelle ist auch aus der medizinwelt nicht mehr wegzudenken verwenden sie es aber nur als quelle f r vorinformationen oder als abrundende zusatzinformation und keinesfalls zur selbstdiagnose und selbstbehandlung sprechen sie daher im anlassfall stets mit ihrem arzt bzw dem apotheker denn sie k nnen sich mit einigen minuten oder stunden auf medizinischen webseiten bestimmt kein wissen aneignen f r das ein mediziner oder pharmazeut jahrelang studiert und praktiziert hat
8866881 vielleicht kann man patientinnen auch tipps geben welche seri sen internetseiten sie aufsuchen k nnen wenn sie sich zus tzlich noch n her ber ihre erkrankung oder behandlung informieren wollen eine solche internetseite sollte n mlich weder f r den medizinischen laien zu wissenschaftlich sein noch soll sie zu falschen oder missverst ndlichen informationen f hren wichtig ist also auch welche seiten angesichts des fast un berschaubaren angebotes f r medizinische laien berhaupt empfehlenswert sind

8866889 we democrats measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma
8866890 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honours the dignity of work
8866891 we have serious grounds to think but no proof ed that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8866892 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8866893 obviously we will be targeting our third away win in the league this year although you can never take anything for granted in speedway
8866894 the lads will need to keep focused and work hard but if they perform as we know they can then hopefully we will get the result that we want
8866895 mildenhall might be a small track but it rides likes a big fast one so you really have to race there to score points
8866896 the boys will need to stay on the gas throughout
8866897 intinya dibicarakan baik baiklah aku kan juga manusia punya hati
8866898 there are a few players in the dressing room at the moment that dont want to be here and you can sense that to be honest but you have to move on and grit your teeth
8866899 if you defend like that you are always going to get beaten against any level of opposition it is disappointing we have to come up with the answers and that is the challenge
8866900 this is the first time weve had it and its fantastic to see the young lads who weve never had before come through
8866901 weve worked hard to get together a squad of players who will be competitive in south west 2 and i expect to be in the knockings at the end of the season
8866902 hindu and christian peace committees have been meeting and the leaders have appealed for calm
8866903 coach kilmartin always brings some talented players across the pond and its a great physical match up for us
8866904 its also a good chance for the coaching staff to evaluate the squad and see where we are as a group
8866905 at 41 hes still got so much enthusiasm and drive and he is so effective on the field
8866906 im very pleased with who weve recruited and if it wasnt for the injuries i would be in seventh heaven to start the season
8866907 were using this as a real trial to have a good look at everyone
8866908 but that gives the boys who come in a real chance to make an impression and its still about fitness game plan and working your socks off in time for the season
8866909 we want to give people something to look forward to
8866910 we know there are concerns we know there are questions is it going to happen is it not going to happen and i think the way you ease that tension is by saying this is where its going to happen this is when its going to happen get excited about it
8866911 if we look at our current financial standing right now for what we have in the bank if we look at the exact expenses rent one salary storage unit the nitty gritty stuff if we didnt do anything we would be around for about six months but obviously we are going to do things
8866912 that actually is a better picture than we first thought so that gives us breathing room to move forward and make our plans
8866913 even though we had a deficit we had a heck of a pride this year
8866914 we cant throw that out and say that one was terrible we had great things in there the way the aids quilt was set up in that room was just a great way to present it we had great crowds we had people stand in the rain for hours to see the parade
8866915 the two things that hurt us on the income side were our sponsorships and attendance
8866916 we definitely have wonderful and loyal sponsors we just didnt get enough new sponsors this year the other part is what didnt show up the day of the event
8866917 we wanted to do something and we knew were going to take a risk either way but we took a low level risk
8866918 yes we wanted to have a good concert that would get people in the door but we didnt want to say oh my gosh if we do poorly we could lose 200 000 or 250 000
8866919 i think its very important for people to realize that what we are doing right now is what would have been wonderful to be doing last year
8866920 you cant approach sponsors and vendors until you have your venue nailed down and not finding out until december or january and then having to do a search as quickly as possible put us behind three or four months
8866921 as far as im concerned everything is on the table
8866922 we have had a lot of people say that an october festival would be nice that would be something we could look at were not locked in to anything at this point
8866923 one thing we discussed in the aug 23 meeting is how we need to and want to reach out to the community better than ever this year its almost a brand new world were almost an entirely volunteer organization
8866924 we need input from the community we want everyone to feel like they have a voice in pride next year
8866925 whatever team he warnock puts out he always gets them up for it thats the type of manager he is
8866926 i know him well he is a character i guess people either love him or hate him he gave me five years at sheffield united and ill always be thankful for that and i also had him as my manager at bury when i was a young lad
8866927 but it would be nice to put one over him
8866928 i had five years at sheffield united and they were good times but i felt it was time to leave and start a new challenge
8866929 i dont think i have ever won against reading so it will be better to be with them than against them i just want to get started and get playing
8866930 all the boys have made me very welcome and im glad to be here
8866931 i had a ball straight to the face which was a nice welcome i dont remember too much after that but its been good
8866932 its certainly a difficult game to choose a team for especially after the week weve had with a poor performance on the saturday and then an excellent performance on the tuesday
8866933 the senior player will still take precedence the team is still developing for the season so prior to this game weve done okay although nothing special
8866934 no one has come in for any of our players
8866935 i dont expect anything to happen now but you never know
8866936 i dont think much of it when those people who are preparing the summit go public beforehand
8866937 the eu must take on a united stance find clear language and come to a clear political course versus russia
8866938 theres something thats profoundly moving for us and touches us to the core and says this is where we belong
8866939 and heres a man who wants to label our belonging in this country in a way thats never happened before
8866940 if we are able to elect barack obama president pick up some senate seats pick up some house seats we will have the majority that will enable us to do i think what we want to do
8866941 we want to get married join the army and get a job
8866942 discrimination has no place in a nation founded on the promise of equality
8866943 we can do it and barack says that in the world as it should be what does that look like in the world as it should be we can work together to repeal laws like doma and dont ask dont tell and we can oppose divisive constitutional amendments that would strip civil rights and benefits away from lgbt americans because discrimination has no place in a nation founded on the promise of equality
8866944 the federal government fully protects all of us in the world as it should be including lgbt americans especially against hate crimes thats the world as it should be
8866945 to make the world as it is and the world as it should be one in the same
8866946 the day after she gave her big speech and all the media were following her around she came to an lgbt event
8866947 even though were in the general election and the right is out to get her and her husband she still showed up
8866948 that one percent that two percent that three percent that we so often win states by and you know that and that one percent that two percent could well mean the difference in target states all over this country and not just to elect barack obama and joe biden and we will elect them but also we shall re elect governors senators members of congress so that we dont have the kind of hateful legislation proposed that we have seen in the last four and eight years we will change that
8866949 rick santorum was a wonderful example of a man who needed a change in career
8866950 all of us banded together to make it happen and there are thousands of people in this nation that are really in need of a new career
8866951 it is our job when we leave here and go back home to talk to all of our community republicans independents as well as democrats and new democrats young democrats about john mccain and what kind of an administration he would bring
8866952 he has never voted never voted for anything that would advance our peoples equality
8866953 not for hate crimes not for enda with or without transgender or hate crimes with or without transgender he has never voted for it he is a staunch opponent still of changing the ban on gay service members when other people have now said that the time has come to change it
8866954 i know lenox mall will be off the chain this weekend
8866955 well probably get mobbed but it will be worth it
8866956 i performed last year at fever and we did a cat walk at traxx but actress eva pigford showed us up
8866957 as an entertainer you are being entertained by the crowd gay pride brings out our most die hard fans
8866958 the more and more we go out we just found out gays are the livest crowd so dont hold back atlanta
8866959 it helped me a lot im not going to blame it on editing i was pretty crazy on the show but i had to own up to it
8866960 many girls get trapped through fashion theyre promised they will be models and taken somewhere and told they cant tell their parents and they end up as sex slaves this group is about bringing awareness
8866961 theres something about gay pride and my culture we can really bring it
8866962 but at the same time to each his own and i plan to be at each and every black gay pride event i can
8866963 i still remember that scary day when two american soldiers with bayoneted rifles stomped up to our los angeles home and ordered us out
8866964 my mother was born in sacramento my father was a san franciscan i was born in los angeles
8866965 but that didnt matter there were no charges there were no trials
8866966 i went to school in a black tar paper barrack and we began the school day every day with the pledge of allegiance
8866967 i could see the barbed wire fences and i could see the guard towers as i recited the words with liberty and justice for all
8866968 producers are always looking for reasons to reject too tall too short too gay and i didnt want to give them any reason to reject me
8866969 very frankly i was living a double life i dated women i took them to premieres and so forth
8866970 i looked over and there was one extra in this sort of open shirt uniform and he was breathtaking
8866971 that was when i knew that walter knew and i said walter youre right so i was not out but known
8866972 you may have seen at his roast i tried to drive that into his brain but i think i only got to the top of his head
8866973 my aunt back in the 40s wanted to marry a caucasian man and that couldnt be done until the california supreme court declared it equal in 1948 and theyre still happily married
8866974 at that time the rallying cry was the purity of the race now its defined as a man or a woman were finding out what american democracy really is about you should marry who you love not artificially designated by gender
8866975 we wanted to craft a wedding that is tailor made to say us
8866976 she didnt like the word matron so we changed it
8866977 its going to be a somewhat of a show bizzy musical comedy oriented
8866978 as a matter of fact our wedding march is going to be one singular sensation from chorus line so it might be a little bit toutou but its who we are we love musicals

8866997 this step is biased and is aimed at justifying the aggressive actions of georgia
8866998 i think dr king would have been proud to have witnessed tonights events
8866999 no place in my mind or im sure his would we have imagined seeing so many people of all type of backgrounds rallying behind someone like us who had been denied full participation for so long
8867000 the walls that king and obama are trying to tear down are much different
8867001 king was trying to tear down the walls of injustice obama is trying to build walls of opportunity
8867002 he couldnt mention martin he couldnt mention the civil rights movement he couldnt mention those who sacrificed and gave so much its very very difficult to actually create a new world if you dont acknowledge the world from which you are emerging
8867003 if we were being true to kings dream wed be talking about poverty how to eradicate it and the long list of things that mattered to him
8867004 i just fear that his legacy will get glossed over
8867005 for most americans august 28 1963 was the dream speech day and for them its like a happy day
8867006 that is a one dimensional view of the risk and terror of that day
8867007 the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation
8867008 has given the negro people a bad check a check that has come back marked insufficient funds but we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt we refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation

8867153 because i was playing some tournament before i play in the states i wasnt playing that good and i was thinking am i really made to play tennis am i going to get in the top 100 one day because its not worth it to play tennis if youre not in the top 100 at one point i was thinking like to maybe stop at the end of this year
8867154 he is more than any other contemporary political figure a creature of these times
8867155 this is a person who could help him manage the pressures of the life he thought he wanted
8867156 i didnt think of him as someone to send out on mechanical tasks of digging out all the cases
8867157 he is able to use his disciplined mind to not get caught up in the emotional swirl
8867158 i have to get better and i will do better
8867159 thats where the high minded and big thinking barack came in
8867160 you need to accept that role to a degree if youre the nominee or the president
8867161 i dont think thats a role he wants to play
8867162 his idea is that you should always be challenging the institution
8867163 pese a su fortaleza la cual le permite jugar cerca de la canasta rival atesora un lanzamiento m s que aceptable desde media distancia esta cualidad le ayuda a la hora de jugar abierto y facilitar huecos al compa ero suyo que ocupe la posici n de p vot

8867167 dit is een zeer zeer teleurstellende nederlaag maar die heb ik te accepteren
8867168 ik maakte te veel onnodige fouten en mijn service liep ook niet lekker dit is erg frustrerend want ik weet dat ik zoveel beter kan
8867169 ik voelde er vandaag niets van net als in mijn vorige partij deze nederlaag laat zien dat ik harder moet werken en trainen om me te verbeteren

8867172 we hebben veel gepraat en hard getraind dat heeft de speelsters dichter bij elkaar gebracht om deze wedstrijd te winnen zullen ze voor elkaar door het vuur moeten gaan en hun eigenheid moeten inleveren dat vinden sommige meiden lastig
8867173 de meiden zijn een stuk fitter dan toen dat bleek eerder deze maand toen we tijdens een trainingskamp in pretoria met 2 1 wonnen van zuid afrika de knvb had voor pretoria gekozen omdat het op grote hoogte ligt daardoor konden we goed werken aan het fysieke deel maar goed de tegenstander heeft ook niet stilgezeten het aantal topsportprogrammas in zwitserland groeit de laatste jaren als paddestoelen uit de grond en met beatrice von siebenthal heeft zwitserland een zeer ervaren coach in huis gehaald
8867174 het is cruciaal met de introductie van de nederlandse eredivisie hebben we een grote stap gezet het aantal vrouwelijke knvb leden is de afgelopen anderhalf jaar met zon 20 000 gegroeid we hebben televisiezendtijd er zijn sponsoren maar ook in het vrouwenvoetbal tel je alleen mee als je internationaal speelt om te professionaliseren zullen we nog meer sponsoren moeten aantrekken en die bereik je vooral op grote toernooien als het ek
8867175 anders dan de hockeysters stonden wij nog nooit in de eindronde van een ek in die zin gaat de vergelijking een beetje mank van de waterpolosters kunnen we daarentegen w l een hoop opsteken in de voorbereiding naar dit toernooi heb ik de meiden een interview laten zien met waterpolocoach robin van galen na de halve finale tegen itali in peking van galen legde in dat gesprek uit wat ervoor nodig is om tot zon prestatie te komen lief en leed met elkaar delen en drie jaar lang alles opzij zetten ik vond het leuk te zien dat zijn boodschap aankwam bij de speelsters die passie en ambitie daar kunnen zij veel van leren want laten we wel wezen er is nog een lange weg te gaan nederland kampt met verschillende blessures waaronder die van heerenveen spits nangila van eyck ja de blessure van nangila is een forse tegenvaller zij is een explosieve speelster iemand die wat extras kan brengen maar ik verwacht veel van tessa oudejans fc utrecht red tessa is pas zestien jaar maar heeft twee duels in het vrouwenelftal onder 19 jaar gespeeld tegen zwitserland krijgt ze een uitgelezen kans haar visitekaartje af te geven
8867176 the fact that nintendo is confident to say even before the end of the first half that overseas sales are this strong will likely help the stock ride a wave towards the christmas shopping season
8867177 games arent all that expensive so theyre appealing even now something like a car of course is quite different
8867178 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8867179 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture
8867180 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8867181 there will be heavy sledding for the u s economy during the next couple of quarters
8867182 with the rest of the world now slowing and the dollar off its lows the u s will be more reliant on domestic demand in coming quarters
8867183 since consumer spending is slowing down and the credit crunch is tightening its grip it is hard to foresee another quarter with such a robust gdp headline for some time
8867184 recent in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that a single genetic event in the map kinase signaling pathway may be sufficient for thyroid cell transformation and tumor development
8867185 thyroid cancer is associated with exposure to external or internal ionizing radiation elucidation of mechanisms of radiation induced cancer in humans especially early steps and pathways has potential implications for epidemiological risk analyses early clinical diagnosis and chemopreventive interventions
8867186 that means that a younger person living close to the bombing site would be more likely to have adult onset thyroid cancer having ret ptc rearrangements
8867187 it could be either by direct dna damage or by other pathways such as a result of radiation induced genomic instability
8867188 we need to do due diligence and come to a consensus that we can present to the university of north carolina constituents

8867190 in the aftermath of the break down of negotiations becker made it clear that it intended to move aggressively to undermine quintiles business
8867191 more specifically becker advised quintiles that it was moving forward with its plan to target a member of quintiles senior management team
8867192 as i expressed to you and as i have discussed with becker i have had a good career with quintiles consulting and i want to leave on a positive note
8867193 when will made that song i think it was touching to every person in america because it really said something
8867194 i did it because i was inspired by barack obamas speech in new hampshire and that wasnt even his victory speech that was a speech where he lost
8867195 if he could inspire me when he lost just think what hes gonna do when he wins i dont know how im going to contain myself im just gonna keep writing and writing and writing and not for fee for free for freedom

8867266 it would be a serious mistake to think that manchester and us will get through and we must respect the other teams
8867267 the important thing is to have confidence in ourselves its clear that the game at old trafford is going to be very difficult but we will enjoy playing in an atmosphere like that
8867268 they celtic play a very physical game and we will be just as difficult as manchester
8867269 in such an important competition no draw would have been easy because all the teams have a great level
8867270 we have to go out and play our game to win away from home and make el madrigal into a real fortress
8867271 i think peter storrie pompey chief executive has made him an offer of a short term contract but i dont know where he is at with that
8867272 he has had a bad knee but if thats all right hes a good player
8867273 if you ask me though i do get the feeling it is not going to happen
8867274 but i saw him play against chelsea two or three years ago for barcelona and he was fantastic that night in the middle of the park
8867275 i dont know for sure who i can get but we need some the only way i can buy is if i sell two or three who i am willing to let go but they dont seem keen on moving
8867276 i still have a good squad and we will still be back up there this season mid table or above is still the aim
8867277 i know they got beaten 4 2 on the weekend against melbourne but they are a very fine side theyve got fullbacks who want to get forward and theyve got players in the midfield who want to try to play out all the time
8867278 daniels extremely dangerous shane smeltz is probably one of the best strikers in the a league so certainly theyre very dangerous
8867279 smeltz certainly is a big factor in their team winning or not and certainly daniel is those two drive a lot of it and especially going forward
8867280 we didnt get enough numbers going forward against queensland so to play with two up front agos going to have to be fit
8867281 that was a tough ask for robbie younis last week his debut away to queensland under that sort of pressure so we didnt expect too much from him and he was disappointed with his performance but its nothing you can hang him out to dry with it was always going to be a tough ask no matter who played in that role
8867282 dodd is a very good option we used him in the asian champions league and he was very effective for us
8867283 i know a few people have been critical of alemao personally as a footballer hes an exceptional footballer he needs time to adapt and its a different country
8867284 hes playing a different type of football than hes used to in brazil where he played a little further up and showed all his attacking flair were using him more as a fullback knowing he can get forward
8867285 victory in this derby will give us an extra motivation for the rest of the tournament
8867286 it was a very eventful tie and gremio were very difficult opponents but i think we were the better team on the pitch

8867372 kalau ada momen dalam karirku di mana aku menyesali sebuah keputusan itu pastilah sehari setelah final piala fa saat agenku bilang klub x menginginkanmu besok dan aku bilang tidak aku suka di sini dan tak mau pergi aku ingin tetap di sini
8867373 itu adalah momen yang kusesali setelah hari itu usai final aku seharusnya meninggalkan chelsea dan saya pun berkesempatan mengucap selamat tinggal kepada fans dan sepakbola inggris di wembley jadi itulah momen yang kusesali karena musim berikutnya hanya bertahan beberapa bulan
8867374 di chelsea yang kupunya hanya punya teman dan tak ada masalah dengan siapapun tapi jika aku ada di sana satu dua tiga empat pekan lagi mungkin sekarang aku takkan bisa bilang begini aku cinta klub itu aku ada dalam sejarah klub tersebut dan meninggalkan klub di saat yang tepat untuk merasa seperti ini dan mengatakannya dengan jujur
8867375 jadi itu adalah waktu yang tepat untuk pergi tapi jelas jika aku menyesali satu keputusan dalam karirku maka itu adalah keputusan tinggal di chelsea tidak satu musim lagi tinggal di chelsea beberapa bulan lagi

8867462 in tegenstelling tot john mccain zal ik geen belastingkortingen meer geven aan grote ondernemingen die amerikaanse banen verplaatsen naar de andere kant van de oceaan in plaats daarvan zal ik die kortingen geven aan bedrijven die hier banen cre ren ik zal belastingen verlagen voor kleine bedrijven en startups die de goedbetaalde high tech banen van morgen opleveren en voor onze economie onze veiligheid en de toekomst van onze planeet zet ik een duidelijk doel als president over 10 jaar zullen we niet meer afhankelijk zijn van olie uit het midden oosten
8867463 ik zal u precies vertellen wat ik bedoel met change ik zal belastingen verlagen voor 95 van werkende gezinnen omdat het verhogen van belastingen voor de middenklasse in de huidige economie het laatste is wat we moeten doen
8867464 washington praat al dertig jaar over onze olie verslaving en john mccain doet daar al 26 jaar vrolijk aan mee

8867468 i think the big thing is to feel that you are wanted by your club your manager your team mates and the fans
8867469 it was a big disappointment for the fans to see what happened during the summer
8867470 ade is a big big player and last year he showed he has the quality to be one of the best in europe so of course we are behind him
8867471 it is difficult of course for the fans but i am sure if he starts scoring goals and by december is on 15 or 20 then everything will be fine
8867472 i think he showed he is a great player william is the captain so you have to look for someone to blame
8867473 unfortunately it is him but i dont think the players think that is right
8867474 we dont blame him for everything everyone makes mistakes everyone is behind him and it will remain like this

8867486 pedro will be marvellous for rangers and you could not meet a nicer lad i didnt want to lose him to be honest
8867487 the situation simply is that i had to sell someone to try and raise money for other things there were other players who didnt want to go and really i couldnt sell anyone other than pedro
8867488 he would have been in my team at chelsea for the first game of the season if i hadnt had to sell him two days before he wasnt surplus to requirements it was just purely down to finances and the situation
8867489 pedro is a great guy and wonderful player there is something good about his attitude you couldnt meet a nicer lad

8867502 it has become clear that my call has gone largely unanswered
8867503 ik verwacht dubbelcijferige groei over 2008 en ook over 2009 maak ik me geen zorgen
8867504 er is sprake van een tekort in de energiesector en in duitsland
8867505 dat betekent dat wij gewoon harder ons best moeten doen om op hetzelfde niveau te blijven ik maak me totaal geen zorgen
8867506 er is sprake van stabiliteit op een hoog niveau de arbeidsmarkt gaat nog steeds uitstekend
8867507 winkeliers hebben nu veel extra kosten gemaakt daar gaan we zeker nog over met elkaar in discussie
8867508 het belangrijkste probleem is dat de software van de nieuwe systemen vaak niet goed aansluit op de software van de kassasystemen in de winkels
8867509 ik twijfel er niet aan dat ze hierin zullen slagen
8867510 i dont see mcmc as an independent body especially when they are acting in the interest of the government
8867511 this will just make people speculate that they are under the direct control of the government
8867512 however if mcmc decided to take this banning trend to another level banning political blogs i can claim immunity as a parliamentarian and i will speak up for other bloggers
8867513 when you block a socio political site with thousands of visits daily you are sending out a message you dont encourage discussions more so when it runs opinions contrary to what appears in mainstream media
8867514 it makes the ban seems suspicious and it makes malaysians more and more distrustful of those in power
8867515 le monde est une com die pour ceux qui ont une t te une trag die pour ceux qui ont du coeur
8867516 there is a way out but it is an arduous one that would lead through tough genuine negotiations if polisario could tentatively contemplate a negotiated solution short of full independence it would instantly be assured of overwhelming international support for its self evident insistence on solid internationally anchored guarantees against a future repeal of the agreed constitutional arrangement or a gradual erosion of civil liberties such as freedom of speech on grounds of national security if at some time in the future polisario is ready to explore this avenue i hope it will not just introduce amendments to the moroccan proposal but submit a comprehensive autonomy proposal of its own
8867517 we had made some decisions upon our business strategy earlier in the year and found that our old website was going to be something of a hurdle when it came to achieving our new business goals we took a long hard look at where we were and where we wanted to be and decided it made the best commercial sense to re develop the website before moving our business forward
8867518 we have completely re defined the entire way we do business as part of this website overhaul we examined each business process and highlighted any that needed to be made more efficient and to shift the focus of all processes towards providing ultimate service to our clients what may look like a simple facelift of our website to the public is actually a window view of an entire new operational model for us

8867726 people were cheering for an encore but jillians told us that because of a sound curfew they couldnt allow us to play another song we had fans who came all the way from bakersfield and we didnt want them to leave without hearing their favorite song so we grabbed our acoustic guitars and went outside and had everyone gather around us it was really neat everyone sang it with us
8867727 were still a young band we started about eight months ago
8867728 but all of us have the ambition to keep going with music and actually make it into a career were trying to get our names out there as much as possible on the internet our myspace page has had more than 130 000 views which is pretty good for a new band and were concentrating on playing lots of shows around las vegas and eventually playing out of town starting with california and utah weve already landed some opening slots for established local and national acts including secondhand serenade jet lag gemini and thee armada weve decided that well were all christian thats how we all started so thats who we are and how we write were gonna go for a mainstream sound though so were not just hitting the christian market we just use it as another thing to write about and to inspire other people as well
8867729 my brother and i moved here three years ago from michigan and theres not much of a scene there and its really hard to get your name out there theres a good scene here pretty much everybody knows everybody and theres always band drama
8867730 bands will help each other out to get different gigs and sometimes even go on tour together and there are a lot of scouts in vegas right now especially since a bunch of las vegas bands like the cab the killers and panic at the disco have made it big
8867731 dna is terrific and nobody doubts it but because it is so powerful any chinks in the armor ought to be made as salient and as clear as possible so jurors will not be overwhelmed by the seeming certainty of it

8867737 there will always be foreign players and coaches and we dont have an issue with that if theyre of high quality
8867738 what we do have an issue with is the run of the mill foreign player who is standing in the way of the development of some very good english youngsters
8867739 the balance is shifting back to english players now and thats something we need to protect because long term if that starts to fall then were in trouble
8867740 if you dont have the number of players coming through the english system that are qualified then that will affect the performance of the england team
8867741 theres no doubt about that and were seeing it happen in football
8867742 clubs such as wasps and leicester have seen the benefits of relying on english qualified players while gloucester and harlequins are moving in that direction
8867743 if you rely too much on foreign players who come for the money they will take the money and go two years down the line but what have they left behind
8867744 i think dr king would have been proud to have witnessed tonights events

8867746 the walls that king and obama are trying to tear down are much different
8867747 king was trying to tear down the walls of injustice obama is trying to build walls of opportunity
8867748 he couldnt mention martin he couldnt mention the civil rights movement he couldnt mention those who sacrificed and gave so much its very very difficult to actually create a new world if you dont acknowledge the world from which you are emerging

8867759 it appears to be a case of do as i say not as i do for small business managers they admit to feeling pressure from customers to show their resilience and they clearly expect businesses to be able to provide them with the service or product they are seeking and will go to a competitor if something is not available yet they are doing very little to protect their own business from this type of switching
8867760 we realised some time ago that we simply could not afford any downtime within our business as a small company the consequences of not being able to deliver a quality service to our customers would be extremely severe and the actual investment is minimal when compared to the damage any downtime would cause to our brand reputation and customer loyalty putting a business continuity plan in place has allowed us to better understand the information flow within our business and identify weaknesses and critical business functions that need to be protected
8867761 genes control cravings and so i cant help be fat
8867762 we are making a major down payment on the fulfillment of that dream
8867763 will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8867764 words and his example inspired an entire generation of the young and old the rich and poor people of all faiths races cultures and backgrounds to believe that we had the power we had the ability and we had the capacity to make that dream a reality
8867765 tonight we witness in part what has become of his dream
8867766 would be quick to remind us that realizing his dream is not barack obamas job alone america needs more than a great president to realize my fathers dream
8867767 weve come a long way but we must march again

8867775 ok my financial situation may be suffering the economy is tanked and worsening hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent daily for a war in iraq that john mccain promises to continue he has insinuated he isnt against instituting the draft and the middle class has all but disappeared thanks to eight years of a republican administration but i like it just the way it is and i wouldnt change a thing

8867779 should not be interpreted as an endorsement of or support for the conduct of the state party
8867780 im very disappointed that they chose not to deal in justice but issued an inside the beltway power move on this
8867781 this decision is not a just decision and the party is going to have to pay the consequences for that
8867782 they said it was illegal but then rubber stamped it
8867783 the power brokers are convinced that they can maintain control with no serious challenge they have it wrong we will challenge them on all fronts in every state and at all levels of government individual liberty must be our goal
8867784 we dont know why the party feels the need to use dirty tricks
8867785 republicans should be concerned how these activists new to the party have been treated
8867786 a decision like this makes it difficult to think theyll be energized to vote for sen mccain
8867787 mccain has to do it himself he cannot rely upon a smooth running state and county level machinery
8867788 a good candidate can survive a lacking party structure a lacking candidate cannot survive a good party structure
8867789 obviously we have our challenges we have our work cut out for us
8867790 well work through it for republicans right now it is a more difficult time but lets not get too far ahead of ourselves the democrats havent won anything yet

8867816 we interview customers after a few months of using scooters and find that the great majority are happy not only because of the money they are saving on gas but because of the sense of liberation they get and the convenience they dont have to think about parking and about congestion
8867817 there are 30 million scooters on the road in europe and only a million in the u s but the same drivers that created the pro scooter behavior in europe are becoming a reality here people spend 3 7 billion hours in traffic gas prices will never go back to 2 50 a gallon and the population density in metropolitan areas will get higher and higher
8867818 in dollars in the first seven months we are no 1 but our japanese competitors tend to sell more because they sell more of the 50 cc scooters also we are very new to the market and our dealer network is 300 dealers honda for instance has a dealer network of 11 000 to 12 000

8867911 first of all i would like to thank mr kenan and mr cohen for the work they have done for wizcom and wish them success for the future my main tasks as the new ceo of wizcom shall be to complete the turnaround program to develop our distribution channels and oversee our entrance into new markets the first signs are positive but it is too early to make any definite statements about this
8867912 although we posted a loss and a significant drop in revenues we are starting to see the results of our turnaround strategy we are witnessing developments in order taking from our customer base that should see us reduce the drop in revenues towards the end of the year and we expect to finish the year with around us 8 5 million in revenues moreover we have overcome the technical issues we had with our third generation product and were able to restart shipping to china at the beginning of q3 this in addition to the cost cutting measures we have implemented in q2 and that will start to have an impact from q3 onwards should we believe see us return to profitability
8867913 as to our cash position even if we have witnessed a decrease over the past six months we do expect that we will generate a positive cash flow over the next six months we are however exploring options to strengthen our balance sheet the appointment of ms omari as vp finance will ensure a smooth transition of operations as she has been with the company since summer 2007
8867914 ich m chte zun chst michael kenan und roy cohen f r die von ihnen f r wizcom geleistet arbeit danken und ihnen gleichzeitig alles gute f r die zukunft w nschen zu meinen wichtigsten aufgaben als ceo wird der abschluss des turnaround programms die weiterentwicklung unserer vertriebskan le sowie die vorbereitung des eintritts in neue m rkte sein wir sehen erste positive resultate es ist jedoch noch zu fr h um hierzu detaillierte informationen ver ffentlichen zu k nnen
8867915 obwohl wir einen verlust und einen erheblichen umsatzr ckgang ver ffentlicht haben beginnen wir erste ergebnisse unserer turnaround strategie zu sp ren mit dem aktuellen auftragseingang aus unserer bestehenden kundenbasis gehen wir davon aus den umsatzr ckgang bis zum jahresende reduzieren zu k nnen f r das gesamtjahr erwarten wir einen umsatz von rund 8 5 mio us dollar dar ber hinaus haben wir die technischen probleme bei unserem produkt der dritten generation behoben und zum beginn des dritten quartals wieder mit der auslieferung nach china begonnen hierdurch sowie aufgrund der implementierten kostensenkungsma nahmen glauben wir in den bereich der profitabilit t zur ckkehren zu k nnen
8867916 in sachen liquidit t erwarten wir obwohl wir innerhalb der letzten sechs monate einen r ckgang der finanziellen mittel hinnehmen mussten dass wir im zweiten halbjahr einen positiven cash flow erwirtschaften k nnen dennoch bewerten wir parallel die m glichkeiten zur st rkung unserer bilanz die ernennung von yulia omari zum vp finance wird auf der operativen seite f r einen reibungslosen bergang sorgen da sie bereits seit sommer 2007 im unternehmen arbeitet

8867986 crediamo che alla scuola serva chiarezza ha spiegato il ministro per questo ci sar un ritorno dei voti accompagnati dai giudizi che saranno esplicativi del risultato raggiunto dai ragazzi
8867987 il consiglio dei ministri ha espresso parere favorevole in merito al ritorno al maestro unico per la scuola primaria ha detto il ministro il provvedimento sar contenuto nel piano programmatico per la scuola contenuto nella finanziaria e su cui stiamo lavorando con il ministro tremonti

8867990 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
8867991 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni

8867995 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
8867996 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
8867997 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
8867998 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
8867999 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza

8868007 tutto quello che ho imparato nei miei otto anni da presidente e tutto il lavoro che ho fatto da allora in america e nel resto del mondo mi hanno convinto che barack luomo giusto per questo lavoro
8868008 sedici anni fa mi avete dato lonore di guidare il nostro partito alla vittoria e guidare la nazione in una nuova era di pace e prosperit insieme abbiamo battuto i repubblicani in una campagna dura nella quale venivo attaccato perch troppo giovane e inesperto per essere il comandante supremo delle forze armate vi ricorda qualcosa nel 1992 non ha funzionato perch noi eravamo dalla parte giusta della storia e non funzioner neppure nel 2008 perch anche obama dalla parte giusta della storia
8868009 quello di sapere ispirare la gente infondere la speranza guidarla verso un orizzonte pi alto ha lintelligenza e la curiosit che non possono mancare in un presidente ha mostrato di avere una chiara comprensione della politica estera delle sfide sul fronte della sicurezza nazionale e una ferma determinazione a rimettere in sesto le nostre forze armate
8868010 il mio candidato non ha vinto ha voluto sottolineare ma sono orgoglioso della sua campagna elettorale e di tutta la gente che lha sostenuta hillary far di tutto per appoggiare obama e cos siamo in due anzi siamo 18 milioni
8868011 voglio che tutti sappiano che sono orgoglioso di avere joe biden e tutta la sua famiglia al mio fianco per riprenderci lamerica

8868014 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
8868015 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
8868016 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti

8868031 autrement comment pourrait il proposer des centaines de millions de dollars dexon rations fiscales aux grandes entreprises et aux compagnies p troli res mais pas un centime dall gements fiscaux pour plus dune centaine de millions dam ricains
8868032 autrement comment pourrait il proposer un plan de couverture maladie qui taxerait les salaires ou un projet sur l ducation qui ne ferait rien pour aider les familles payer luniversit ou un plan qui privatiserait la caisse nationale de retraite et jouerait votre pension au casino ce nest pas parce que john mccain sen moque cest parce que john mccain ne comprend pas

8868068 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8868069 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8868070 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

8868075 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal

8868082 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8868083 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8868084 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8868085 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8868086 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8868087 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8868088 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8868089 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8868090 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8868091 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8868092 who are open to doing something on the production side
8868093 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8868094 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8868095 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8868096 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8868097 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8868098 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8868099 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8868100 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8868101 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

8868104 evenmin ben ik het eens met de analyse hieronder dat amerika verzwakt is in
8868105 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8868106 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8868107 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8868108 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8868109 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8868110 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8868111 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8868112 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8868113 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8868114 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table

8868119 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8868120 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8868121 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8868122 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8868123 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8868124 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8868125 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8868126 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8868127 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8868128 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8868129 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8868130 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8868131 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8868132 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8868133 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8868134 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8868135 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8868136 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8868137 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8868138 we have to progress from the group stage and to do that you need 10 points to qualify
8868139 the tournament really kicks off in february that is when it gets exciting the one off knock out stages
8868140 i think we have a squad to challenge the best but you cannot think of yourselves as favourites when you see teams like ac milan barcelona and juventus
8868141 still we have to worry about the hurricanes effect on this market
8868142 oh well hes here let him on stage for a couple of minutes
8868143 when a pastor has lost his home his church his livelihood you dont think clearly no matter how strong you are
8868144 if i had not had this support our recovery would not have been as quick
8868145 these leaders were dedicated before in a spiritual pastoral way but not connected to a civic leadership role
8868146 the leadership development gives me a lot of confidence that this will have longevity and sustainability
8868147 helped me think more critically and analyze where i was going and how to get there it was very inspirational in getting us back up
8868148 people are ready to go to new orleans for a week help rebuild and come home again

8868191 its important we bounce back we dont want to give up any ground but im sure john ward will be saying the same
8868192 john took over when carlisle were in a good situation last season they will have been disappointed not to have gone up through the play offs but theyve made a good start again and its always a difficult place to go and win
8868193 im happy with the nucleus of my squad obviously its thin and to have two wide players out at same time is hard

8868196 its all happened really quickly for me over the last couple of seasons and im pleased with the progress

8868212 what are the odds of a relationship with my high school sweetheart really working out what if it fails are the risks of what i will lose too great and even if it does work out is it even a good thing am i missing out on too many important life experiences i e dating being with different people and will i hold resentments about missing out that will poison our partnership

8868302 the symbol of all things practical and all things comforting
8868303 you dont invite the stranger into the kitchen unless you really like them the living room is preserved for that
8868304 many people dont make as formal meals anymore so the kitchen table becomes a place where a lot does happen
8868305 if youre not in the kitchen youre going to miss out
8868306 the kitchen itself is really becoming a living room in american homes
8868307 you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at

8868312 quite frankly we dont think we have the capability of pulling this off
8868313 the state is coming up with all the funding we need but we think that a manned vessel capable off plumbing the depths of gordon browns approval ratings is just simply beyond us at the present time

8868320 the worst thing a man can admit is im not 100 percent fulfilled by my family
8868321 twelve years ago i would have been hard pressed to understand why id want to be involved sexually with one person this long
8868322 before t a the longest my intense sexual interest would last would be maybe two years but the thing men dont realize is that initial rush you get from sex gives way to something else a lot of guys run with fear when that intensity starts to fade but the real rewards of a relationship come after youve been together a while thats where t a and i are lucky it keeps getting deeper its kind of exciting im as surprised as anybody
8868323 im not running for president so i dont have to answer that question but theres nothing wrong with acknowledging the panoply of lifes rich experience

8868350 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
8868351 moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is always a vice
8868352 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
8868353 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
8868354 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
8868355 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
8868356 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
8868357 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
8868358 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
8868359 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
8868360 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
8868361 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
8868362 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
8868363 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
8868364 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
8868365 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
8868366 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
8868367 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
8868368 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
8868369 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
8868370 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
8868371 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
8868372 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
8868373 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
8868374 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
8868375 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
8868376 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
8868377 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
8868378 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
8868379 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
8868380 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
8868381 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
8868382 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
8868383 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
8868384 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
8868385 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
8868386 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
8868387 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
8868388 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
8868389 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
8868390 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
8868391 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
8868392 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
8868393 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
8868394 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
8868395 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
8868396 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
8868397 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
8868398 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
8868399 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
8868400 try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value

8868424 by partnering with the new jersey housing and mortgage finance agency and the live where you work program we are able to enhance housing affordability for residents and township workers as a result of this opportunity many more woodbridge township families and workers and first time home buyers will be better able to negotiate the current economic times by taking advantage of a program that provides real incentive and benefit to purchasing a home right here in the township

8868433 its something like a very thick copper lens about 12 13 inches in diametre and three inches thick
8868434 its reminiscent of the way that the romans cast their ingots when they occupied britain
8868435 three were found in the late 1800s and this one has been returned to amlwch from the family of mrs brennan
8868436 previous ones had borne roman letters stamped on them but this one doesnt have a stamp at all
8868437 then they would have been taken back to rome to make arms and the short daggers that the romans used
8868438 it should be in a museum its very heavy and ive given the thing to them
8868439 the remains of the fort at cramond are actually one of the most important roman sites anywhere in britain
8868440 although there was an extensive dig in the 1950s overseen by a local couple alan and viola rae this one will cover areas that have never been looked at before
8868441 we are hoping to find out more about the origins of the fort who might have been occupied there and at what time it may be that the romans were in cramond much later than we currently think
8868442 i cant wait to see the results the local community have always been very enthusiastic about the roman fort and im pleased theyre able to take part in these new excavations

8868447 i dont think much of it when those people who are preparing the summit go public beforehand
8868448 the eu must take on a united stance find clear language and come to a clear political course versus russia
8868449 deplored russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8868450 this step is biased and is aimed at justifying the aggressive actions of georgia
8868451 it ignores russias well argued stance in favor of the difficult but under the existing circumstances the only right decision to recognize south ossetias and abkhazias independence
8868452 in accordance with this plan some russian peacekeepers remain deployed in a security zone neighboring south ossetia
8868453 hindu and christian peace committees have been meeting and the leaders have appealed for calm
8868454 we want that violence should be stopped immediately to restore peace and normalcy in the violence affected areas
8868455 biased and aimed at justifying the aggressive actions of georgia
8868456 theyve been saying loud and clear that they feel they could do whatever they want with impunity
8868457 but i think any kind of reaction they would take to the eu would be in kind like visa restrictions or a business contacts freeze i dont think the retaliation would include the kind of things like restricting oil

8868472 can russia guarantee that such actions wouldnt be made in other countries
8868473 at this time i was im beijing as you know and i had a chance
8868474 so what we should allow to kill us but in exchange of it to save place in g8 but who will be presented at g8 if all of us will be killed we talked with you about possible threat from russia you and me we sit now and peacefully talking in the city of sochi at several hundred kilometers from here american army ships have arrived with missles on board the distance of firing is exactly several hundred kilometers its not our ships came to your shores but your ships came to our shores so what choice do we have we dont need any complications we dont want to argue with anybody to fight with anybody we want partnership and respecting us and our interests
8868475 russias decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia in contravention of its own commitments and obligations could portend further disregard of this institution the security council and its undertakings by one of its permanent members
8868476 this should be a source of concern and reprobation not only for the members of the council but for every member of the united nations whose charter requires that all member states should refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state
8868477 i would like to say that i really liked the statement of the u s permanent representative who was reminding to the members of the security council that states must refrain from the use of force or from the threat of use of force
8868478 i would like to ask the honorable representative of the united states have you found weapons of mass destruction in iraq or are you still looking for them
8868479 irresponsible decision to recognize the two georgian enclaves as independent states
8868480 the resolutions of the security council cannot be challenged or indeed written off by military action in defiance of the un charter
8868481 in particular the territorial integrity of a un member state reaffirmed repeatedly by an unanimous council cannot be undermined by a sudden armed intervention by a neighboring state
8868482 by its actions moscow has effectively ruled out agreements on a comprehensive council response to the situation in georgia
8868483 russias military action and its recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia represent a unilateral attempt to redraw the borders of a neighboring country through the use of force it is our view that it is entirely unacceptable and unjustified
8868484 more opportune moment and under a formula to be decided

8868532 cyprus currently has very similar prices to other european capitals such as paris for example this never used to be the case i hear all the time from tourists that cyprus is expensive
8868533 due to time constraints they wont be here for the whole tournament and their under 14 team will play some exhibition matches the coaches accompanying the teams will also conduct workshops for the budding footballers
8868534 we have also doubled the prize money this year the winning team in the junior category will get rs 1 00 000 while the runners up will get rs 60 000 in the sub junior section the champion team will get rs 50 000 and the runners up rs 30 000
8868535 while we have shown that the new probe can work for two types of procedures we believe that results will be more far reaching
8868536 there are many catheter based interventional procedures where 3 d ultrasound guidance could be used including heart valve replacements and placement of coils in the brain to prevent stroke wherever a catheter can go the probe can go
8868537 while the images obtained this way are good some patients experience adverse reactions
8868538 also the images gained this way are fleeting the 3 d ultrasound guidance does not use x ray radiation or contrast agents and the images are real time and continuous
8868539 public toilets in delhi an emphasis on the facilities for women in slum areas
8868540 a man has options but a woman cant urinate in the open as that is deemed uncultured the issue of public toilets affects women the most especially poor women
8868541 people talk about feminism all the time but nobody thinks of a need as basic as a toilet for them despite the fact that our chief minister and mayor are both women
8868542 we are preparing ourselves for the commonwealth games and its horrible that the citys civic agencies do not even perform their basic duties its a violation of the rights of citizens especially women who have no option but to defecate in the open
8868543 one day during my internship with ccs i saw a woman cleaning a public toilet at yusuf sarai it struck me that though she was cleaning the toilet she herself couldnt use it since it was meant only for men like most public toilets in delhi i decided to find out the real status of public conveniences in the city
8868544 in the indian context its sad but true that an ideal woman is one with a dress a smile and a vagina no one cares to look at the number of pipes and organs in her body that are there to give birth to a life and that she needs a hygienic toilet
8868545 officials from the slum department of the mcd said the norm in slum areas is one latrine seat for 150 people and a 20 20 20 latrine seats for men and 20 latrine seats for women for a plot meant for 500 households
8868546 the mcd should make it mandatory for companies who show interest in constructing repairing and maintaining toilets on a bot basis in lucrative areas to also do the same in slum and resettlement areas
8868547 i was nervous going onto the court because i never saw her play before so i didnt know what to expect
8868548 i thought i can slowly get into the match she played completely different than i expected serving extremely well and hitting very powerful shots
8868549 i made too many unforced errors and my serve was not working really well its very frustrating because i know i can play so much better
8868550 i have to put some hard yards on the court and go back out there and work hard
8868551 i felt nervous at the beginning and then it went away
8868552 i dont know how i did it i am not thinking about anything right now just enjoying the moment i dont realise yet that i have beaten the number one in the world i dont realise that i played at the big court i dont know how im going sleep tonight
8868553 i think it still could be better especially i was 4 1 up in the first set and then i let it go to 4 all
8868554 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
8868555 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8868556 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8868557 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
8868558 this indicates that people remain stable in their verbal abilities unless they are experiencing disease processes that also increase their mortality risk
8868559 a change in verbal ability might therefore be considered a critical marker for degeneration in health in older people
8868560 thyroid cancer is associated with exposure to external or internal ionising radiation elucidation of mechanisms of radiation induced cancer in humans especially early steps and pathways has potential implications for epidemiological risk analyses early clinical diagnosis and chemo preventive interventions
8868561 it could be either by direct dna damage or by other pathways such as a result of radiation induced genomic instability

8868596 after they abandoned the search for the terrorists who attacked us and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us its time for a change
8868597 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says we cant have no timelines to draw down our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely or should we listen to barack obama who says shift the responsibility to the iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home
8868598 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights you know john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8868599 should mom move in with us now that dads gone fifty sixty seventy dollars just to fill up the gas tank how in gods name with winter coming how are we going to heat the home another year no raise did you hear they may be cutting our health care at the company now we owe more money on our home than our home is worth how in gods name are we going to send the kids to college how are we going to retire joe you know folks thats the america that george bush has left us and thats the america well continue to get if george excuse me if john mccain is elected president of the united states of america freudian slip freudian slip
8868600 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8868601 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8868602 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8868603 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8868604 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8868605 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8868606 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8868607 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8868608 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8868609 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8868610 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8868611 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8868612 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8868613 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8868614 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8868615 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8868616 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8868617 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8868618 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8868619 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8868620 we have had quite a number of calls where people are saying that there is no point in having them if they cant take them on metro
8868621 the main reason for having the vehicles is to give a sense of freedom and independence so people can get into the town centres and do shopping
8868622 our first responsibility is to protect the safety of all our passengers
8868623 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8868624 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8868625 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8868626 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8868627 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8868628 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8868629 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8868630 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8868631 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8868632 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8868633 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8868634 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8868635 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8868636 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8868637 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8868638 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8868639 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8868640 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8868641 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8868642 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8868643 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8868644 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8868645 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8868646 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8868647 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8868648 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8868649 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8868650 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8868651 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8868652 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8868653 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8868654 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8868655 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8868656 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8868657 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8868658 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8868659 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8868660 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8868661 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8868662 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8868663 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8868664 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8868665 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8868666 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8868667 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8868668 no one works for someone we all just work together
8868669 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8868670 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8868671 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8868672 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8868673 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8868674 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8868675 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8868676 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8868677 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8868678 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8868679 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8868680 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8868681 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8868682 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8868683 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8868684 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8868685 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8868686 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8868687 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8868688 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8868689 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8868690 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8868691 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8868692 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8868693 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8868694 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8868695 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8868696 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8868697 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8868698 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8868699 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8868700 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8868701 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8868702 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8868703 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8868704 saya juga berterima kasih kepada setiap orang yang selama ini mendukung

8868866 street evangelist brandt russo was released from a florida jail this morning and intends to return to a group of homeless men living near a lakeland church
8868867 im just going to continue to love the pastor and staff that got me arrested and the homeless people
8868868 the reason i didnt mind getting arrested is theyre still out there
8868869 im trying to rest up before i go back there and get in a bunch more trouble so it seems

8868872 its the spirit of the 60s its nonviolent civil resistance
8868873 prophets all through the ages have pulled stunts but those stunts are to redirect people back to god
8868874 all of it bottom line im the general manager so if you want we can clear this out of the way this is not a joe girardi issue
8868875 i put together a club that is where its at and im responsible for that
8868876 cut through all the red tape and stuff i think girardis done a tremendous job given what has occurred and he continues to try to remain upbeat with this coaching staff to try to keep these players up and to try to perform up to their abilities
8868877 thats frustrating for all of us but the buck stops right here with me and id say it shouldnt go any farther than that my job is to put it together my job is to fix whats broken and my job is obviously frustrating the hell out of me right now to be honest because i just believe were better than this
8868878 if i knew why i wouldve fixed it unfortunately its my job to put it together and then fix whats broke and obviously i have not been able to figure that out
8868879 i do know one thing this team is trying they are not laying down thats a fact they do care they want to win and for some reason its just not happening
8868880 id like to read them and obviously i would talk to hank about it first before i addressed it publicly

8868885 the linden park developer al neyer inc was unable to secure the required number of condominium presales and commercial preleases to break ground within an anticipated timeframe
8868886 unprecedented downturns in the housing market contributed to slow sales
8868887 while we recognize the lack of acceptance of both the for sale housing and retail as market driven we do not feel that this type of product can be successful even in the future and encourage the community to consider alternate uses for the site
8868888 we believe we will hit our condominium pre sales goal this year and begin construction as soon as we can

8868893 the current difficulties in the uk economy are likely to persist well into 2009 and as a result our priority will continue to be on managing the groups roll out plan prudently conserving cash and borrowing capacity appropriately and maintaining our focus on london and other high quality student locations in terms of development activity
8868894 the groups concentration on ultra luxury saloons and super sports car franchises protected the results to a degree from the real market conditions as our new car business has and continues to be able to rely on a number of forward orders
8868895 the board remains confident that its strategy of downsizing to a smaller and more focused specialist car group has greatly improved the prospects for the group and in combination with our strong balance sheet remains a good defensive action against the prevailing market conditions
8868896 despite the current backdrop of uncertainty in the financial markets all our core operations are performing well
8868897 our plan to diversify the business away from a dependence on the commercial property development sector has gone well and we have a steady flow of work across all the regions we operate in
8868898 the prevailing economic climate shows little sign of improving and we therefore remain cautious with regard to the short term outlook
8868899 the book will raise the readers curiousity because it integrates math formulas and puzzles into the plot they keep him her actively engaged from beginning to end
8868900 if anything youre starting to see the necessity of why you have to get younger weve had some injuries theres no doubt about it but weve got some key guys who havent performed like theyre capable of is that because of age
8868901 obviously as weve seen this year you cant have enough pitching
8868902 ultimately what i feel is a strong reluctance to trade three or four assets to another team for a player and then sign him to a multiyear contract you trade for a guy give up three or four assets and then pay him then youve crushed your payroll and your assets at the same time
8868903 if you choose to play in that free agent marketplace the one thing youd be sacrificing is a draft pick
8868904 were very protective of our draft picks but for the right player and the right circumstance ive always said were still big game hunters
8868905 but when we held on to a guy like that you dont do it and say ok in the next four months hes got to do x hes got five years whatever it is to show why you bet on someone like that

8868919 we believe the z750 is such a compelling offer because not only will it be one of the best looking clamshells on the market but it also provides the tools or applications which really let you get the most from these broadband speeds
8868920 sony ericsson is continuing to deliver on the promise of the marriage of sony and ericsson with iconic products such as the z750 says najmi jarwala president sony ericsson mobile communications usa inc there is no question that hsdpa is critical for north american gsm operators and we believe products like the z750 will entice the mass market to tap into everything these faster networks enable consumers to do while on the move

8868928 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
8868929 it was originally seen at about 5pm running down the road by a passing cyclist he said it ran away from him so he followed it it then ran down our drive and into a pile of rubble in the garden we have just knocked down our shed and it hid among the bricks
8868930 the cyclist knocked on our door and told us about it we have been in contact with daltons zoo and they have been round and put traps in our garden
8868931 they said it isnt theirs i just want to warn people that it is out there it seemed very tame as we fed it some tuna and some mackerel
8868932 because asian otters are smaller than native ones if it comes across a native breed it could be in for a bit of trouble
8868933 from the photos i have seen of it it looks in pretty good condition
8868934 i wouldnt advise people to approach it as with any wild animal it should be treated with some level of respect as they do have very sharp claws
8868935 it is better if you get off at the next stop and walk across the road at the light
8868936 what a great young lady you should have asked her to begin with
8868937 you look like that beautiful man who is going to be the president in america have you seen him his name is barack obama
8868938 fu anche docente di materie giuridiche alluniversit di palermo prima di distinguersi nella guerra di etiopia e quindi personaggio di grande rilievo di cui ci sembrava ingeneroso cancellare il ricordo
8868939 despite the current backdrop of uncertainty all our core operations are performing well
8868940 our plan to diversify the business away from a dependence on the commercial property development sector has gone well and we have a steady flow of work across all the regions we operate in
8868941 our forward orderbook is in excellent shape with a strong mix of work due for completion in the current year and beyond our cash balance remains strong at 19m
8868942 we are well positioned to meet the demands of the current market and the run up to the 2012 london olympics
8868943 we love the taste of soft natural bodies with unshaved bushy pussies
8868944 ich bin stolz auf das was ich als fahrer erreicht habe aber ich fahre nicht in der formel 1 um ber hmt zu sein
8868945 die menschen in polen sehen mich als beispiel dass es m glich ist eines tages in der formel 1 zu fahren auch in einem land ohne motorsport tradition
8868946 es ist unm glich in polen zu relaxen wenn ich joggen gehe werde ich immer von leuten verfolgt allerdings ist es sehr wichtig zu entspannen um genug energie zu haben ich stehe auf kartenspiele und bowling nicht lachen bowling ist kein leichter sport
8868947 a drawn out legal dispute would have led to significant delays to the town centre redevelopment as well as substantial costs to the public purse
8868948 it is a very unfortunate case and hopefully a one off but obviously a precedent has now been set
8868949 we hope other developers will be interested in bidding but in the current climate who can be sure this is a big scheme running over a period of years and there may also be a mistaken perception that the two bidders already involved will be automatically selected
8868950 this level of detail has previously only been seen in the procurement of service and pfi contracts

8868961 heres the interesting thing about lava its not very fast wait did we say interesting we meant boring
8868962 it is just like a monitor on your desk only deeper
8868963 it uses an external power supply like a laptop that minimises heat issues
8868964 indeed it is so quiet that users dont notice the nose over other office monitors they wouldnt know it is on
8868965 organisations that select loco2pcs can expect to gain substantial payback through savings on their power bills estimated at 100 per pc every year
8868966 100 is not a controversial figure it is a conservative figure
8868967 in the worst case scenario when an organisation is running old pcs that are left on overnight the annual savings could be as high as 250 especially if they dont have a sleep mode indeed the whole system could completely pay for itself in two to five years

8868973 we the conscientious people of jammu and kashmir believe and uphold that the human life and its dignity are sacrosanct and in this regard we feel deeply concerned and aggrieved over the news story carried by sections of indian media on 28th august 2008 in which it is reported that the indian intelligence agency has expressed fears about the possible attacks on minorities in kashmir
8868974 since 1989 there have been some massacres of minority communities under mysterious circumstances which created an atmosphere of fear and mistrust amongst the communities
8868975 in the present scenario where the non violent mass uprising for the attainment of right to self determination of people of jammu and kashmir is resonating not just in india but also in the international media and institutions the reported threat to minority communities whether hindus or sikhs is a serious concern for the civil society of kashmir
8868976 in view of the above mentioned concern we urge upon the community leaders religious leaders political parties militant leadership and government to ensure the utmost respect and tolerance for the minorities and refrain from any such act which makes the lives of minorities uncomfortable the minorities should not be treated as the cannon fodder to carry out the agenda of vested interests in sabotaging the peoples movement of kashmir in the wake of present peaceful peoples movement to realise the right of self determination the only democratic process for peace making we urge upon the governments and the militant leadership to implement a comprehensive ceasefire in jammu and kashmir we the people of jammu and kashmir while welcoming the united jihad councils recently announced statement in which they promised to halt their activities within civilian areas request them to broaden the scope of their statement into a comprehensive ceasefire covering the entire indian administered jammu and kashmir this would also mean their respect and primacy to the peoples movement
8868977 we consider this as the testing time for all of us as humans we certainly have been victimised but the challenge for the conscientious people is always to be humane besides being politically correct
8868978 in the present situation where the political leadership has been arrested communications blocked curfew imposed there is every likelihood that situation may descend into chaos it is therefore we urge international community to take cognizance of the situation where in the whole population of kashmir is being pushed towards the wall for international institutions it is the time to intervene for preventing the catastrophe and for the restoration of peoples rights
8868979 we take this opportunity to assure our hindu and sikh brethren who form the inseparable part of our cultural and political mosaic that they will find their muslim brethren besides always whatever be the circumstances we have lived and suffered together and would continue to strive together for our political emancipation
8868980 motta is here at the moment and we are having at look at him
8868981 our commitment to building a new world class lfc stadium is undiminished
8868982 like many other major development projects in the uk and overseas we are affected by global market conditions and as such work on the project will be delayed in the short term
8868983 due to the problems encountered on thursday night the company tata has decided that there would be no attendance at the project site during any of the shifts on friday
8868984 the channel senses the pressure inside the bacteria as a result the channel alters its shape and creates an opening releasing the pressure
8868985 the motion is just like that of a camera iris and being able to see this motion is an amazing discovery
8868986 not only is this a major step forward in scientific understanding of a fundamental process in biology but it paves the way for the development of new drugs against bacteria
8868987 new chemicals forcing channels to stay open or shut are likely to kill or at the very least greatly slow down the growth of bacteria slowing down the growth gives the body s natural defences time to tackle its bacterial invader
8868988 i know i shouldnt theyre silly money but i just keep telling myself that theyre worth it
8868989 i just felt like trying something absolutely amazing everybodys got to do it once right
8868990 scientists have identified a mutant form of a gene or allele that prohibits the growth of armour
8868991 by documenting the physical traits and genetic makeup of the offspring produced by these marine sticklebacks in freshwater we were able to track how natural selection operates on this gene
8868992 we found a significant increase in the frequency of this allele in their offspring evidence that natural selection favours reduced armour in freshwater
8868993 it leads us to believe that the genetic expression is also tied to increased growth rate
8868994 if the fish arent expending resources growing bones which may be significantly more difficult in freshwater due to its lack of ions they can devote more energy to increasing biomass
8868995 this in turn allows them to breed earlier and improves over winter survival rate
8868996 this study provides further evidence for darwins theory of natural selection by showing that environmental conditions can directly impact genes controlling physical traits that affect the survival of species
8868997 obama stunned the audience with a buss to jill biden
8868998 the blogs were alive yesterday with speculation that obama s on stage kiss with jill biden after her husband s speech was a little too friendly
8868999 the accidental mouth kiss haven t we all been there
8869000 we hope to develop these techniques further and apply them to more volcanoes worldwide
8869001 potentially these techniques could extend our knowledge of volcanic recharge considerably as they can be applied to material erupted before volcanic monitoring was commonplace
8869002 we hope that what we find in the crystals in terms of timescales can be linked with phenomena such as earthquakes
8869003 if we can relate the timescales we measure to such events we may be able to say when we could expect a volcano to erupt
8869004 this is not the time to play politics on the issue i know this is the year of elections therefore people are out to make comments for political reasons
8869005 there is no room for flexibility on the issue of the judiciary there was no room for flexibility on the impeachment of the president there is no room for flexibility on something that we have signed together something on which we have given a solemn pledge to each other when you have an agenda to strengthen democracy and make the parliament sovereign how can you be flexible
8869006 if you recall even benazir bhutto stated that she wanted chaudhry reinstated as the chief justice of pakistan
8869007 the ppp government seems to be still following the agenda of the dictator pervez musharraf it is tragic that the ppp led by asif ali zardari seems to be an extension of the same system
8869008 expectations to heights that not even the colorado altitude could match
8869009 with his speech tonight obama succeeded in wrapping all those goals up in a neat and effective package
8869010 mixing criticism of mccain with his own specific proposals the speech was much more like something you would hear at most any campaign stop and less like what you would encounter in a history book
8869011 i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8869012 the c f bond is difficult to transform into other bonds under mild conditions because it is inert and unreactive its a challenge to chemists
8869013 but we found a way to take a c f bond that you can do very little with and break it and convert it cleanly into something else at room temperature
8869014 conversion of pfcs remains a challenge and our research efforts are directed at designing even more active catalysts capable of pfc activation
8869015 surely my client can see that just take a look at my outstanding portfolio and my blog its clear that im an excellent writer my work speaks for itself why cant they see that
8869016 if you think cheaper writers can do a better job then good luck to you
8869017 know the values that will be inserted in the future this person is clearly crazy
8869018 he never wastes a ball and it would not be surprise to me to see him being named scotlands player of the year at the end of the season in my opinion he is that good
8869019 pedro will be marvellous for rangers and you could not meet a nicer lad i didnt want to lose him to be honest
8869020 the situation simply is that i had to sell someone to try and raise money for other things there were other players who didnt want to go and really i couldnt sell anyone other than pedro
8869021 he would have been in my team at chelsea for the first game of the season if i hadnt had to sell him two days before he wasnt surplus to requirements it was just purely down to finances and the situation
8869022 pedro is a great guy and wonderful player there is something good about his attitude you couldnt meet a nicer lad
8869023 i have been able to have some pretty cool things happen over the last ten days
8869024 it is kind of hard to really take everything and fully experience everything but hopefully after all this is done i will be able to sit down and really think about everything ive had the opportunity to do
8869025 i think the big thing is to feel that you are wanted by your club your manager your team mates and the fans
8869026 it was a big disappointment for the fans to see what happened during the summer
8869027 ade is a big big player and last year he showed he has the quality to be one of the best in europe so of course we are behind him
8869028 it is difficult of course for the fans but i am sure if he starts scoring goals and by december is on 15 or 20 then everything will be fine
8869029 i think he showed he is a great player william is the captain so you have to look for someone to blame
8869030 unfortunately it is him but i dont think the players think that is right
8869031 we dont blame him for everything everyone makes mistakes everyone is behind him and it will remain like this
8869032 our commitment to building a new world class lfc stadium is undiminished
8869033 like many other major development projects in the uk and overseas we are affected by global market conditions and as such work on the project will be delayed in the short term
8869034 there will always be foreign players and coaches and we dont have an issue with that if theyre of high quality
8869035 what we do have an issue with is the run of the mill foreign player who is standing in the way of the development of some very good english youngsters
8869036 the balance is shifting back to english players now and thats something we need to protect because long term if that starts to fall then were in trouble
8869037 if you dont have the number of players coming through the english system that are qualified then that will affect the performance of the england team
8869038 theres no doubt about that and were seeing it happen in football
8869039 clubs such as wasps and leicester have seen the benefits of relying on english qualified players while gloucester and harlequins are moving in that direction
8869040 if you rely too much on foreign players who come for the money they will take the money and go two years down the line but what have they left behind
8869041 disposition naturelle ou acquise pour r ussir en quelque chose
8869042 whats going to happen to us are we still relevant do people still want us
8869043 the forces responded with small arms fire killing the militants
8869044 the first thing we did was appeal to all the parties to stop the hostilities
8869045 we have also sent out patrols to determine what has actually happened and we have combat helicopters on standby
8869046 the work could be felt as a provocation on the part of the population of alto adige 99 per cent of whom are catholic
8869047 injured the feelings of many people who see in the cross the symbol of the love of god and of our salvation which deserves recognition and religious devotion
8869048 the work not only wounds the religious feelings of many who see in the cross the symbol of the love of god but also offends the good sense and feelings of those who do not identify with the symbol
8869049 the controversy has been exploited by politicians including mr pahl for electoral reasons its true the pressure was heavy but we are an autonomous museum and we have taken our decision the work aroused a lot of argument among visitors many liked it and many disliked it but the public row was merely political and it has gone on long enough

8869058 che cosa pensate di qualcuno convinto che bush ha ragione in oltre il 90 per cento dei casi non so quale sia la vostra impressione ma io non sono disposto ad avere solo un 10 per cento di cambiamenti
8869059 mccain tutto tranne che indipendente dice che la nostra economia ha fatto grossi progressi con george bush dice che i fondamentali delleconomia sono solidi e quando uno dei suoi consiglieri ha parlato delle preoccupazioni degli americani lha fatto chiamandoli una nazione di frignoni e ha detto che il vero problema la recessione mentale di chi la abita e non la crisi che gli stati uniti stanno attraversando una nazione di frignoni andatelo a dire ai lavoratori dello stabilimento del michigan che pur avendo scoperto che la fabbrica avrebbe chiuso hanno continuato ad andare al lavoro perch sapevano di essere le persone su cui la gente contava andatelo a dire alle famiglie dei nostri soldati che si sono fatti tre turni in iraq non sono frignoni sono lamerica che conosco
8869060 fatemi spiegare esattamente cosa significher cambiamento se divento presidente indipendenza dal petrolio mediorientale in dieci anni lavorando ad eliminare gli sprechi ed investendo sulle energie verdi tagli fiscali alla classe media e non ai pi ricchi e alle multinazionali che portano il lavoro fuori dallamerica unistruzione di livello per tutti i bambini e un sostegno economico agli studenti per pagare luniversit impedire che le assicurazioni sanitarie possano discriminare chi malato ritirare le truppe dalliraq e concentrarsi nella battaglia contro i terroristi in afghanistan con lobiettivo di catturare bin laden mccain dice che andr a prenderlo inseguendolo fino alle porte dellinferno peccato non siano andati a cercarlo nelle caverne in cui si nasconde
8869061 non avr esitazioni a difendere questo paese e se necessario invier le nostre truppe ma con una missione chiara e il sacro impegno di dare a loro lequipaggiamento di cui hanno bisogno in battaglia e lassistenza che meritano quando torneranno a casa
8869062 sar un presidente che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
8869063 il discorso pi impressionante forse mai fatto a una convention
8869064 obama prende di mira mccain e bush con un forte appello a cambiare lamerica
8869065 era mostrare che ha addosso il fuoco che serve per competere al livello pi alto nella politica americana

8869132 they will have the same marriage rights as other inmates they will be able to marry non inmates but barred from marrying other inmates in prison
8869133 for instance suppose a prisoner finds out another prisoner has money or other assets they might find themselves coerced into a marriage with a more powerful inmate who might try to lay claim to half their assets

8869135 when you lose a son or daughter in a war theres a purpose to that but when you lose a son or daughter to a drunken driver theres no purpose to that
8869136 these are made of steel and the reason we chose steel is because of the way people die
8869137 theyre literally killed by a steel machine in fact weve done a lot of things here in steel for that very reason

8869143 its such a great way to honor victims of drunk driving

8869157 ik vraag respect en privacy voor mijn vrouw en mijn kinderen terwijl we deze situatie als een familie oplossen
8869158 een vrijstaatje in een aangeharkte stad een rafelrand waar door de jaren heen heel wat levenskunstenaars een plekje vonden

8869161 today i felt nervous at the beginning and then it went away
8869162 i am not thinking about anything right now just enjoying the moment
8869163 this is very disappointing to me but something i have to accept
8869164 she played a lot better than i expected she served very well
8869165 i did well i had to come back in third set from down 3 0 in games so i am happy with the victory
8869166 i am happy to be in the third round for me this is a very important tournament
8869167 he is a good player i am going to have to play better to beat him
8869168 not too many long rallies but i am serving well
8869169 i better be ready that girl is a tough cookie
8869170 i tried to go to the net more often because he was using the slice a lot
8869171 still we have to worry about the hurricanes effect on this market
8869172 i think dr king would have been proud to have witnessed tonights events
8869173 no place in my mind or im sure his would we have imagined seeing so many people of all type of backgrounds rallying behind someone like us who had been denied full participation for so long
8869174 the walls that king and obama are trying to tear down are much different
8869175 king was trying to tear down the walls of injustice obama is trying to build walls of opportunity
8869176 he couldnt mention martin he couldnt mention the civil rights movement he couldnt mention those who sacrificed and gave so much its very very difficult to actually create a new world if you dont acknowledge the world from which you are emerging
8869177 if we were being true to kings dream wed be talking about poverty how to eradicate it and the long list of things that mattered to him
8869178 i just fear that his legacy will get glossed over
8869179 for most americans august 28 1963 was the dream speech day and for them its like a happy day
8869180 that is a one dimensional view of the risk and terror of that day
8869181 the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation
8869182 has given the negro people a bad check a check that has come back marked insufficient funds but we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt we refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation
8869183 i feel that he truly does offer hope for this nation for all americans not some americans all americans
8869184 biased and aimed at justifying the aggressive actions of georgia
8869185 theyve been saying loud and clear that they feel they could do whatever they want with impunity
8869186 but i think any kind of reaction they would take to the eu would be in kind like visa restrictions or a business contacts freeze i dont think the retaliation would include the kind of things like restricting oil
8869187 oh well if youre going to play in the champions league you might as well come up against the champions league champions it doesnt get any easier does it
8869188 you have to be honest about it and say this is an even stronger manchester united than the manchester united we faced two years ago
8869189 this time they are champions of europe and champions of england they are a better team now and that will make our job even harder
8869190 the fear of a crude oil rebound triggered selling of the dollar against the euro and the yen
8869191 the u s economy has not made enough of a recovery to push market participants to test the dollars higher levels
8869192 still far from indicating that the u s economy is expanding
8869193 ive had no response of the standard of team that jermaine would be comfortable with
8869194 if jermaine is here i will bring him in and emphasise to him that he is a paid plymouth argyle player and i expect 210 from him
8869195 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8869196 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8869197 basically you open your doors to the public without advertising to serve those folks that stumble by and see you are open
8869198 every day were coming closer together and are getting better
8869199 compared to our first game last year we were nowhere near as ready as we are this year everybodys focused everybodys ready to just unload on somebody
8869200 i came back for the year and it was just a waste
8869201 its incredible hes back out there he is our leader
8869202 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8869203 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8869204 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8869205 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8869206 eso es como decir que la pr xima temporada de 24 tendr m s acci n o que en la pr xima temporada de lost ocurrir n m s cosas inexplicables
8869207 emocionalmente desgarradora digo esto por una raz n y es que no quiero que pens is que vais a pasar por esto sin retorcerte lo que nos ocurre es brutal pocos de nosotros van a superarlo
8869208 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8869209 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8869210 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8869211 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8869212 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8869213 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8869214 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8869215 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8869216 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8869217 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8869218 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8869219 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8869220 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8869221 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8869222 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8869223 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8869224 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8869225 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8869226 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8869227 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8869228 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

8869247 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the no 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurised contents said mr walsh at a press conference today
8869248 it was evident that one passenger oxygen cylinder had sustained a sudden failure and forceful discharge of its pressurised contents into the aircraft hold rupturing the fuselage in the vicinity of the wing fuselage leading edge fairing
8869249 the cylinder had been propelled upward by the force of the discharge puncturing the cabin floor and entering the cabin adjacent to the second main cabin door
8869250 the cylinder had subsequently impacted the door frame door handle and overhead panelling before falling to the cabin floor and exiting the aircraft through the ruptured fuselage
8869251 while some of the fuselage skin had folded outward and away from the rupture it was evident that an area of skin and structure equal to approximately one half of the total ruptured area had separated from the aircraft and was not recovered
8869252 several small pieces of structural honeycomb material of the type comprising the wing leading edge fairing were found trapped around the edges of panels within the left side of the number 3 engine pylon
8869253 a small indentation and cut was found within the number 3 engine intake acoustic panelling located immediately inside the plane of rotation of the engine fan
8869254 as the failed cylinder was not recovered the atsb is currently working with the aircraft manufacturer other aircraft operators and the oxygen cylinder manufacturer to obtain samples of cylinders from the same manufacturing batch as the failed item to facilitate the ongoing investigation of all relevant issues
8869255 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8869256 the implication of a possible mechanism or condition that could affect the structural integrity and safety of other oxygen cylinders used in the aviation environment

8869287 den fantastiske fremmede som de hadde en het aff re med
8869288 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8869289 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8869290 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8869291 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8869292 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8869293 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8869294 dr duckworths experience at darpa with a wide range of technologies users and technology providers make him the ideal candidate for this demanding new position
8869295 he will work closely with all qinetiq north america technical groups to develop the superior technical solutions our customers have come to expect from qinetiq north america
8869296 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8869297 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8869298 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8869299 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8869300 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8869301 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

8869304 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8869305 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8869306 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8869307 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8869308 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8869309 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8869310 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8869311 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8869312 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8869313 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

8869322 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8869323 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8869324 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8869325 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8869326 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

8869333 running is not fun its too hard to be fun even the most devoted runners would not describe the experience of performing a typical workout let alone competing in a race as fun im not saying running doesnt feel good it does feel good in a way that any form of hard work feels good to those who have a taste for it a hard run leaves you exhausted and glad to be done with it some days you dread even starting a run but the overall running experience just feels right like an expression of who you really are
8869334 running teaches you that theres a difference between working hard and feeling bad consumer culture tries to teach us otherwise how many television commercials talk about making life easier but its just not true challenging and testing your mind and body even to the point of exhaustion failure and breakdown can feel as wonderful as anything else life has to offer
8869335 every runner has the potential for mental toughness somewhere inside whenever runners allow suffering to defeat them and consequently fail to do their best it is not because they lack mental toughness but because for some reason they just didnt have the courage that day to access it
8869336 sixty eight percent of all domestic travel is undertaken with the purpose of visiting friends and relatives as a result many south africans dont think of themselves as tourists when they travel shot left aims to change this perception and instill a tourism culture among young south africans
8869337 we have refocused the shot left campaign to target the young people who want to travel
8869338 this campaign aims to show young south africans the emotional educational and social benefits of travel it shows that although travelling does not deliver a commodity that one can show off it gives an expanded view of the world and larger and more profound life experiences
8869339 travelling ups ones street creed and makes one a more interesting human being the campaign marries the enriching and the fun aspects of travel and offers strong personal endorsements by people to whom young south africans can relate

8869362 for instance suppose a prisoner finds out another prisoner has money or other assets they might find themselves coerced into a marriage with a more powerful inmate who might try to lay claim to half their assets
8869363 the law requires they treat people the same so thats a good principle to have in mind when they are drafting regulations
8869364 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision i think well all hear from him shortly and hopefully well be able to move forward together
8869365 i think dr king would have been proud to have witnessed tonights events
8869366 no place in my mind or im sure his would we have imagined seeing so many people of all type of backgrounds rallying behind someone like us who had been denied full participation for so long
8869367 the walls that king and obama are trying to tear down are much different
8869368 king was trying to tear down the walls of injustice obama is trying to build walls of opportunity
8869369 he couldnt mention martin he couldnt mention the civil rights movement he couldnt mention those who sacrificed and gave so much its very very difficult to actually create a new world if you dont acknowledge the world from which you are emerging
8869370 if we were being true to kings dream wed be talking about poverty how to eradicate it and the long list of things that mattered to him
8869371 i just fear that his legacy will get glossed over
8869372 for most americans august 28 1963 was the dream speech day and for them its like a happy day

8869375 has given the negro people a bad check a check that has come back marked insufficient funds but we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt we refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation
8869376 i feel that he truly does offer hope for this nation for all americans not some americans all americans

8869384 earlier this year we undertook the largest expansion initiative in the companys history simultaneously launching 22 new cities
8869385 the successful launch of those cities has allowed us to accelerate our geographical development beyond the original plans we had previously announced expanding by 10 cities in the 4th quarter of 2008 but we are now fortunate to include 3 additional cites

8869388 there are two schools of thought on co morbidity of depression and parkinsons
8869389 one is that the onset of depression precedes and possibly leads to parkinsons the other is that parkinsons disease predisposes for depression clinically theres evidence for both of those lines of thinking
8869390 were going to have some groups that undergo depression first then the parkinsons and then well do the reverse
8869391 then there will be some that are combined depression then parkinsonism then further depression
8869392 so stress induced depression exacerbates problems with movement and also causes the relevant brain cells to die faster
8869393 well we do but there are no really definitive epidemiological studies or long term assessments of the effects of antidepressants on the progression of parkinsons
8869394 not only could they reduce depression but they might actually protect dopamine cells in the brain and thus slow the progression of parkinsons
8869395 the success of the get yourself noticed viral campaign has allowed konica minolta to strategically target its prospective customers and target audience with the competition going global therefore konica minolta will be continuing with the success of the online digital strategy for upcoming campaigns
8869396 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic
8869397 says the studys first author jessica payne phd a harvard university research fellow in the division of psychiatry at bidmc
8869398 emotional memories usually contain highly charged elements for example the car that sideswiped us on the ride home along with other elements that are only tangentially related to the emotion such as the name of the street we were traveling on or what store wed just passed
8869399 explains study author elizabeth kensinger phd an assistant professor in the college of arts and sciences at boston college
8869400 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene
8869401 says payne but she adds among the individuals who were tested after a period of sleep memory recall for the central negative objects i e the smashed car was preserved in detail
8869402 after an evening of sleep the subjects remembered the emotional items smashed car as accurately as the subjects whose memories had been tested only 30 minutes after looking at the scenes
8869403 by contrast sleep did little to preserve memory for the backgrounds i e street scenes and so memory for those elements reached a comparably low level after a night of sleep as it did after a day spent awake
8869404 this is consistent with the possibility that the individual components of emotional memory become unbound during sleep
8869405 i collected the stuff and never ever did a page
8869406 its part of my hobby of self expressing through images
8869407 as a dad now theres a lot of satisfaction in passing along memories to the kids
8869408 everything is supposed to happen in a couple of clicks
8869409 i can scrap while im on the road if i want to
8869410 theres still definitely something about the tactile nature of having 3 d embellishments and touching ribbon and touching buttons
8869411 i think well see more of a move to hybridizing before we see paper die out completely
8869412 it buzzes on the surface of the tongue and tingles underneath
8869413 the lightest cream sauce but with all the parmigiana flavor you could want in an alfredo
8869414 nice even texture the meat tasted fresh and it has just the right ratio of sauce to meat
8869415 tons of fresh tomato chunks and consequently a more robust flavor and chewing experience
8869416 can i get on the big dog you guys have got the good life
8869417 just the right amount of tomatoes and cream and just the right consistency
8869418 it wasnt too oily and had plenty of vegetables in it
8869419 layered beauty full of spinach mushrooms tomatoes and zucchini all sheltered in nicely browned right from the broiler mozzarella
8869420 they got it right with some plump olive pieces and just the right amount of spiciness
8869421 too few lobster bits to truly warrant the meals name
8869422 oh so close i just wanted to take some red pepper flakes out of my bag
8869423 right out of college like every other student i was looking for a job
8869424 and mtv was hiring reporters to cover its choose or lose campaign
8869425 there are five of us in denver for the convention
8869426 i have a weekly blog on chooseorlose com and from there it goes to various outlets i shoot video i have my nokia n95 on me which is a live broadcast mobile phone
8869427 the mtv demographic is 16 to 25 year olds were also looking at people wanting to learn more about the issues in their local communities that entails covering issues specific to colorado
8869428 i do a lot of work with the protesters tent state university iraq veterans against the war re create 68 thats been my focus at this convention but im finding that the protests werent as significant as they were built up to be a lot of it was all hype
8869429 its important for older generations generation x and the baby boom generation to understand issues that matter to us were not necessarily concerned with social security because its not in front of us the millennial generation likes to have the things that are right in front of us addressed

8869439 in the past decade several police departments around the country have adopted programs using mobile video recording technology or video cameras mounted in their police cruisers
8869440 although the programs initially encountered some resistance as big brother oversight departments with successful programs report that video cameras have cut down on litigation and liability costs as well as improved relationships between officers and citizens during encounters
8869441 the cost of the hardware ranges from 3 900 to 6 300 per car for cameras that do not have wireless uploading capability
8869442 it catches law violations on film creates an objective record of encounters between officers and citizens and serves as an evidentiary tool in court for both criminal and civil cases

8869473 republican mismanagement has really hit home around the kitchen table
8869474 at kitchen tables across ohio and the heartland mothers and fathers are worried
8869475 tonight families are balancing checkbooks at kitchen tables trying to stay on budget
8869476 i take the train home to wilmington sometimes very late as i look out the window at the homes we pass i can almost hear what theyre talking about at the kitchen table after they put the kids to bed
8869477 its a wonderful image its an image that stays with you because it mirrors reality
8869478 the symbol of all things practical and all things comforting
8869479 you dont invite the stranger into the kitchen unless you really like them the living room is preserved for that
8869480 many people dont make as formal meals anymore so the kitchen table becomes a place where a lot does happen
8869481 if youre not in the kitchen youre going to miss out
8869482 the kitchen itself is really becoming a living room in american homes
8869483 you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8869484 i spent 5 1 2 years in a prison cell
8869485 i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
8869486 we take this very seriously and we are working with the machine manufacturer to determine the cause of the problem to ensure that this doesnt happen again
8869487 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision i think well all hear from him shortly and hopefully well be able to move forward together
8869488 i was just kind of a void i did seem to function all right but i was just kind of out of it
8869489 when you lose a son or daughter in a war theres a purpose to that but when you lose a son or daughter to a drunken driver theres no purpose to that
8869490 these are made of steel and the reason we chose steel is because of the way people die
8869491 theyre literally killed by a steel machine in fact weve done a lot of things here in steel for that very reason

8869494 we wont have any deaths by dwi someday thats going to happen
8869495 i couldve stopped with new mexico but i just kept thinking you know theres no reason why weve got the room why cant we just represent the whole nation
8869496 we arent aware of anything else that is on the same scale as what new mexico is doing
8869497 its such a great way to honor victims of drunk driving
8869498 id like to see the states join is send us any material that they would like for us to display to show on our videos to have available for the public that stops here i want this to become a center for dwi information and the states efforts against it
8869499 i have lots of dreams lots of dreams i dont stop dreaming about this
8869500 if it does work out well it will probably be a small plus for us
8869501 obviously if it doesnt work out well then the republicans are going to have a problem
8869502 its more of a problem if youre the guy living in the eye of the storm
8869503 our concern is for the lives in the storms potential path
8869504 this is not about politics its about people and doing whats right
8869505 come on guys be statesmen and use this as an opportunity to educate the public about how important it is to fully fund firefighters to educate the public and to be prepared
8869506 listen to the guy thats been on the mountaintop and listen to the guy thats been down into the valley of you know where nothing worked and listen to what i have to say
8869507 they will have the same marriage rights as other inmates they will be able to marry non inmates but barred from marrying other inmates in prison

8869557 although sales in russia are growing significantly russians are in fact only now starting to discover chrysler vehicles let me remind you that dodge brand was officially introduced in russia as recently as two years ago here at the moscow motor show
8869558 now every second car sold by us in russia is a dodge and i am sure that the new cars presented here in moscow will contribute even further to russians interest in our brands
8869559 we are becoming increasingly active outside north america in the past chrysler used to aim at niche segments offering cars that had been originally created for the american market
8869560 today outside of the u s we offer vehicles that were designed with consideration for varied market requirements around the world and that policy is paying dividends in terms of sales with russia in particular driving our international sales growth

8869568 the conference was not a time for making new laws or for binding decisions the conference design group believed strongly that the chief need of our communion at the moment was the rebuilding of relationships the rebuilding of trust in one another and of confidence in our anglican identity and it was with this in mind that they planned for a very different sort of conference determined to allow every bishops voice to be heard
8869569 if ars ne said he needed 30 million for a striker he would get it no problem at all it is not our decision who he spends money on and nor will it ever be we totally back ars ne i hear all the time that we have no money but i just wish someone would take the time to look at our accounts this is a proper business which produces its own cash and lives or dies by its performances this constant suggestion that the stadium is bleeding us dry is crap

8869579 chelseas 31million capture of robinho was in doubt last night after real madrid president ramon calderon blocked the deal the blues were confident of landing the brazil winger after weeks of negotiations and a flight to the spanish capital by chief executive peter kenyon on wednesday night chelseas website was offering shirts with robinhos name and number to be confirmed but that was pulled last night as the chance of the deal collapsing emerged chelsea are understood to have completed an outline agreement to sign the 24 year old in discussions with real sporting director predrag mijatovic but calderon has yet to give the final approval and appears to have had second thoughts about the sale
8869580 for arsenal supporters there was good news and bad news from the champions league draw yesterday the good news is that according to danny fiszman the director and a significant shareholder if ars ne wenger walked into his office this morning and requested 30 million for a striker the funds would be made available in an instant the bad news he has not and fiszman does not think he will either

8869583 tottenham hotspur are considering a move for miguel veloso the highly rated sporting lisbon defensive midfielder before the closure of the transfer window on monday night
8869584 if we have any more violence we could withdraw the champions league final from rome its not an ultimatum just a message that we are keeping an eye on it
8869585 for fernando torres it promises to be emotional for celtic it is a chance once again to tweak the tail of manchester united the champions of europe for the rest of us the champions league group stages draw looks set nicely for the english contingent as the big four were once again given the kind of group games that should see them all safely through to the business end of the competition all the premier league sides avoided the group of death group h where real madrid juventus zenit st petersburg and with rather less of a reputation bate borislov of belarus were drawn against each other instead english interest will be focused on torres who returns on 22 october to atletico madrid the club who developed him from the age of 11 for the first time since he joined liverpool for 20 5m last summer
8869586 four barclays premier league powerhouses but where is the threat to stop another english invasion of the champions league final barcelona are the natural challengers with a new coach in pep guardiola and a different way of playing jose mourinho will love keeping roman abramovich waiting for another year and beware bayern munich under jurgen klinsmann he means business on their return to the competition the hardest draw is real madrids group where uefa cup holders and russian champions zenit will pose a serious problem to the established powers one of madrid or juventus might struggle to find a way through
8869587 it is rash to believe that english clubs now have an ineffable superiority there may not have been a final without a premier league member taking part since 2004 but liverpool and arsenal supporters would not claim at this moment that their teams are without flaw
8869588 arsenal could not have asked for two more treacherous trips for their first two away games for a start chelsea can testify to the dangers of visiting fenerbahces screaming cauldron while any journey to kiev whether its freezing or not proves troublesome factor in the practised threat of fc porto and this is clearly a challenge allowing few mistakes even so its one that arsene wengers players should navigate succesfully
8869589 the last time manchester united were in europe they came back with the champions league trophy and on one of the supporters flights home a clutch of sir alex fergusons grandchildren aged nine and below drew a round of applause for regaling the entire plane with a high pitched song about the way john terry had slipped on his bum one hundred days after that epic night in moscow it is fair to say that ferguson and his players will be viewing tonights european super cup final against zenit st petersburg in a very different light
8869590 the super cup is regarded as a mere trinket by some but ferguson who still regrets fielding a weakened team against lazio nine years ago says that united will take it seriously just as they did the community shield in which they beat portsmouth this month he has talked up the importance of winning the super cup and indeed the club world championship which will take them to tokyo in december and stated that the objective apart from giving much needed match practice to gary neville owen hargreaves and nani is to return to manchester this evening with another trophy
8869591 fabio capello was left fuming on thursday night after rafa benitez and sir alex ferguson took steps which could seriously undermine englands chances of qualifying for the next world cup already angry that he had not been told by liverpool that steven gerrard was about to undergo a groin operation the england manager then heard ferguson reveal that owen hargreaves would take part in tonights european super cup final for manchester united but would not be fit for englands crucial tie in croatia next month
8869592 england boss fabio capello is reeling after two stunning blows from rafa benitez and alex ferguson liverpool chief benitez insisted kop captain steven gerrard has to have a groin operation immediately ruling him out of next months world cup qualifiers with andorra and croatia and fergie claimed owen hargreaves is not fit enough for england duty either even though he is in manchester uniteds squad for tonights european super cup clash with zenit st petersburg
8869593 when you hear that a powerful italian man with big connections has come looking for you it can be a bit unnerving but thankfully it was england manager fabio capello at fratton park to watch my portsmouth play manchester united on monday it has been well documented that he wasnt happy with some of the comments in my sun column but i was delighted to sort it out with him and we had a good chat the first thing he said to me when we met after we lost 1 0 to united was harry if you can play sylvain distin at left back then i can play steven gerrard on the left wing i replied i think youre right mate from then on it was a great opportunity to talk about a few things and get a few things straight
8869594 england have more than enough quality players to emerge unscathed lets not start looking for excuses already
8869595 the troubled regime of tom hicks and george gillett jr at liverpool suffered another severe blow last night when it emerged that they are preparing to postpone construction of the clubs new stadium because of difficulties raising the funds in an unforgiving financial market hicks and gillett had hoped that the building of a 60 000 capacity stadium on the site at stanley park barely a quarter of a mile from the clubs anfield home would start within weeks dispelling some of the concerns about their ability to drive liverpool forward but their apparent failure to do so casts further doubt about their credibility as owners increasing the pressure on them to sell to sheikh mohammed bin rashid al maktoum the ruler of dubai
8869596 its not surprising keane seems confused and ineffective with the way liverpool are set up tactically at the moment hes not quite wide enough to be playing down the wing but hes not in the centre either robbies space is squeezed because yossi benayoun and dirk kuyt in theory the wide men dont have much pace so keep cutting inside into his zone and its not like liverpools full backs are providing the width instead they are sitting deep as if theyre trying to emulate david beckhams performances so keane doesnt have the support he enjoyed at white hart lane from attack minded defenders such as pascal chimbonda or gareth bale liverpool are lacking options and ideas then theres his strike partner fernando torres the main man it was a question often asked when torres was with atletico madrid is he a partnership player or does he prefer to operate alone up front
8869597 he may not give you the fantasy but he will supply a comfort and the little things that you only appreciate in hindsight security beating manchester united three times in a row beating liverpool west ham fans should be careful what they wish for the last time they went chasing the fantasy after a series of perfectly adequate mid table finishes around the turn of the century they played a part in the removal of the incumbent harry redknapp and got a new manager glenn roeder
8869598 alan curbishley is under increasing pressure at west ham united with the croatia coach slaven bilic understood to be interested in succeeding him at upton park should he be sacked no final decision has been taken on whether to dispense with curbishley and he may yet salvage his career with a string of positive results but there is a growing sense of frustration over what is perceived to be his negative attitude given the apparent strength of his squad part of the reason for the growing scrutiny over curbishley is a lack of knowledge of the foreign transfer market he has himself admitted to a weakness in this area in the past which helps to explain why west ham have employed the italian gianluca nani as the clubs technical director
8869599 its an indisputable fact that the premier league has more money than serie a
8869600 toronto head coach john carver hailed the second proudest result of his entire career after seeing his depleted charges defeat colorado 1 0 thanks to a fantastic chad barrett free kick his first goal for the club i watched this game and carvers happiness was obvious his post match interview was moving to say the least let me say i am slightly biased ive known jc since the early 90s when during my time as a player for newcastle united he was the academy coach doing a wonderful job under very difficult circumstances until researching this piece i did not realize the parallels between jc his coaching career and the events at los angeles

8869631 will not consider submissions of any books for any of our prizes from random house or any of its affiliates
8869632 no one should expect that publishers print every piece of trash that comes into their offices and the jewel of medina may be neither good literature nor good history
8869633 that is beside the point since random house had already paid a 100 000 advance arranged for book club publication and foreign publication it changed course and self censored solely on the political grounds of fear of offending muslims or fomenting violence
8869634 that form of cowardice will only lead to more and more of this form of self censorship and is an attack on the integrity of literary publication
8869635 we must stand up to it in whatever ways are available to us the form that was available to our small foundation was to put random house out of the running for our prizes
8869636 we cannot pretend that this type of cowardice will disappear without serious remonstrance
8869637 we do this reluctantly since our most recent prize in american historical fiction went to a random house title nevertheless this issue must be confronted

8869668 all of that is acting to slow oil demand growth in the emerging world and youre actually seeing oil demand fall in the developed world
8869669 those things combined mean that the oil market which was already in surplus becomes an even greater surplus going forward and that a lot of speculative money will start to come out of the markets

8869683 pastoral leases have probably been talked up to be more than what they are

8869707 ucc music video contest for breaking up in the daylight was the one who produced the music video
8869708 on december 2007 we held a contest called the breaking up in daylight music video challenge where the winner got an award and was given the chance to produce an all expense paid music video for one of the artist signed under jype
8869709 the contestant who grabbed our attention was kim eui yun who eventually won the contest and was invited to produce the music video for this time which is thought of as wonder girls second title track after so hot
8869710 the music video is about the wonder girls members reading a book titled this time a complicated love story between a designer and a mannequin
8869711 this time is a bright ballad song so we decided to reflect the mood of the song by using only soft colors in the video
