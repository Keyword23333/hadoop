7430002 to tell you the truth i had no idea how it is supposed to be spelled
7430003 we should seek a steady mutual draw down to a ceiling of no
7430004 nato should abandon its anachronistic posture the defense of biden also attacked bushs handling of human rights violations
7430005 no one can expect that trade sanctions against beijing would yield a sudden transformation of that regime but american foreign policy should leave no doubt and the bush administration has left much doubt that the united states stands squarely on the side of chinas brave and aspiring democrats to whom power will ultimately flow

7430012 the burlington county freeholders agreed to purchase 400 acres of farmland having more than a mile of frontage on new jersey state highway 206 from property owners bf amp w realty llc for 4 8 milion dollars
7430013 county officials have not determined how much of the land would be resold but the the property is deed restricted so that it will remain a farm forever the size and prime location of this farm makes it a phenomenal acquisition for burlington county not only as a gateway property to the county farm belt but for the multiple benefits of watershed protection
7430014 community representatives from michoacan informed me that clandestine activities have extracted timber and the above is of total knowledge of the different institutions nevertheless it has not been possible to eliminate this activity given that they act with the protection of a group of loggers that threatens the region our reporting of this excessive logging has not been listened to and as a result the population in general has decided to exploit the forest themselves which with so much sacrifice our former authorities had protected the communities do not trust the government to stop the logging their cynicism reinforces a perverse incentive to participate in the felling if the communication between the farmers and the government is broken solutions cease to exist proposal increased transparency and communication between government and farmers government should listen to the forest owners facilitate reporting of logging increase personnel of the conanp and profepa expected result increased transparency and communication will permit improved capacity by the mexican government to solve environmental crimes bring out evidence of internal corruption improve government farmer relations viability there is a precendent for farmer ngo collaboration and the government should share this aspiration the webpage receives logging reports on the internet that are sent to the government simultaneously they are recorded digitally only transparency communication and public reporting can combat corruption and restore public trust

7430016 our goal is to raise awareness of the importance of the san diegos watersheds and how they are impacted by local communities
7430017 most people dont think about the cumulative effects of their actions and how much difference they can make as individuals
7430018 clean beaches and healthy watersheds are an essential part of san diegos tourist economy and our quality of life today we are training tomorrows stewards of our critical resources

7430020 isnt it about time that we took the power of reality tv and harnessed it to challenge us as human beings to make a difference worldwide first one person then one village then one city at a time race 4 humanity will take ordinary people and pit them against extraordinary tasks around the world we will challenge ourselves and our audience to no longer turn a blind eye or feel its impossible to achieve anything in the overwhelming task of leveling the playing field worldwide to share just a little from others who have so much because its the right thing to do the time is now
7430021 the teams will compete against each other the elements people and places with one common goal to not only complete the challenge in the allotted time but to become international ambassadors of good and not only help but teach at the same time
7430022 our audience will experience the excitement of a survivor with locations like globe trekkers and the heart of extreme makeover all in one never before seen format that will not only entertain but help a world in need because its the right thing to do

7430040 im from conneticut but ive been here for 23 years
7430041 do you know what happened on the tracks this morning
7430042 it would be an adventure and thats what this trip is supposed to be
7430043 it would cost you a hell of a lot of money
7430044 after this trip were going to need 30 words for sweat
7430045 were going to the peak tram do you know where that is
7430046 it was a marketing move we thought it was a pretty interesting strategy
7430047 the aim was to attract attention the people in the queues told passers by about the iphone
7430048 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it then everything got blocked
7430049 at this point im not sure i see a consensus for how the commission ends up addressing it
7430050 its still fresh and im unable to really assign any meaning to it i will reflect on that down the road
7430051 on one hand i am grieving my father in law and my heart aches for my wife
7430052 on the other hand i am extremely happy for my team i am a little bit conflicted i can embrace what has occurred and deal with it accordingly
7430053 some of the guys got upset at how they lost the first set
7430054 we fought fought hard its been a long four years weve gone through triumph and tragedy of the past four years its come full circle four years ago mccutcheon instilled a belief in our team we were eighth in the world four years ago for him to start this tournament off with his wifes father and mother in law going to the hospital to come here and win a gold medal i cant be happier for him
7430055 ever since i met him hes been balanced never too high or too low he sets team and family life apart when hes on the court hes with us 100 percent
7430056 the incident involving todd that influenced so many other people
7430057 there was no motive who knows why this guy did what he did ive got to support my wife and family my job is to get everyone through this sitting here getting angry that is a waste of a lot of emotions
7430058 it has been a long journey since our decision in july 2001 to bring the olympic games to china but there can now be no doubt that we made the right choice
7430059 we are first and foremost an organization devoted to sport but it is sport with a purpose
7430060 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7430061 the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world and i believe this is something that will have positive effects for the long term
7430062 it is clear that china has put the bar very high i believe and my hope will be london can even put the bar higher
7430063 i am looking forward to trying some new events some events ive never really had the opportunity to swim since my schedule is always so crowded
7430064 the convention is a real opportunity to reintroduce barack obama to the american people
7430065 i dont buy that theres been a lack of specificity on his part but the conventions a great opportunity to specify and refine things and make the stakes absolutely clear
7430066 are you going to present this guy who can govern across the middle or is he the guy whos going to modernize reform and bring up to date traditional democratic values
7430067 hes got to define himself because one of the jobs of the republican convention is to define barack obama
7430068 there isnt an area of public policy that this administration has not failed in and the country can not take four more years of it
7430069 that point will be made over and over again there are two paths to the future one is more of the same the other is the path that barack obama represents
7430070 if he cant get that arena hell have a difficult time getting elected
7430071 the elites and the mass public can be on a different wavelength
7430072 theres a real disconnect between whats left of the hillary people in the hall and the hillary people out in the country
7430073 she is fully behind the obama campaign and now her followers need to follow her
7430074 its always tougher to drag your staff and your supporters because theyve been emotionally thrown so much its going to take a rousing speech
7430075 to some extent voters in these states are electing people with that bipartisan approach and pragmatic problem solving
7430076 will it hurt the democrats to be partisan no but barack obama has had a different way of doing politics and i think that will continue
7430077 its like a political convention with this dash of community organizing thrown in
7430078 in 2004 i won a bronze this is a silver maybe in 2012 it will be a gold slowly slowly
7430079 hes from another planet i think hes from a whole other league he could do a cartwheel and win this thing
7430080 the gold medal has confirmed the fact that i am an outstanding sportsman
7430081 obviously this is the best of times and the worst of times
7430082 i felt like a famous singer the whole stage was only for me it was so cool
7430083 in my mind i felt good but my legs didnt have enough running behind them i felt like i was just running on one leg
7430084 its like i imagine being a man its like being kicked in the nuts repeatedly thats how bad it feels you feel like you want to curl up and die
7430085 im going home and getting something to eat and then straight to bed
7430086 i just didnt have it today its a hell of a time not to have it thats the worst 1 000 metres ive put together in years i was a spectator
7430087 im very good at knowing where to push the line if i ever disrespect a ref its because they really screwed up
7430088 he can barely walk he was in tears and he is very depressed
7430089 i have been cheering for the canucks for how long and they still havent won a stanley cup i still love them i hope canadians can think of us the same way
7430090 it was beyond skills almost it was so primeval it was just auto pilot we were flying blind rowing blind we rowed from the heart
7430091 as a girl she never cried for injuries or bleeding she would just cry for losses
7430092 im pretty angry im going to write a nasty letter this is the olympics its not that difficult to organize a three kilometre run weve never run like this before
7430093 i understand the joy he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
7430094 come on when youre running if you see youre going to win youre going to celebrate youre going to be olympic champion youre just happy
7430095 oh lord the second place stepped out the third place stepped out hopefully usain stepped out too so im going home with the gold
7430096 im looking forward to not doing anything just sitting and not moving
7430097 after the pga i had a family vacation my kids and i and some friends we went down to a lake in southern utah and just didnt have a razor
7430098 i got home and thought you know what its the playoffs i guess the old hockey player in me thought well keep it out there
7430099 by signing flip it provides us with another experienced player who has the ability to play multiple positions for us
7430100 because of his versatility he will be a valuable asset for us as a reserve and we look forward to the contributions hell bring this season
7430101 i got a lot i cant complain everything i got it is just that after that gold i was not able to give my country another medal because of wrist injury or i would have got even more but i got enough
7430102 it is still utterly deceptive because the irrational appeal of proximity to the jackpot motivates the consumer far more than an expressed intent to support the activity advertised
7430103 it is still utterly deceptive because the irrational appeal of proximity to the jackpot motivates the consumer far more than an expressed intent to support the activity advertised
7430104 all the teachers in minnesota did was throw worksheets at them

7430106 i was really surprised people made it out to seem more rural than it really is
7430107 if you set high the expectations for kids theyll meet them
7430108 im excited to stand up on that side and look out and see a bunch of pencils scratching hands raised and questions asked

7430114 but at the same time i do feel like im more than capable of doing it and proving to them that i am worthy of something like that one day
7430115 the guys just look up to him because they know hes hard as nails

7430119 by the same token were prone to overestimate our own agency in nature many of the activities humans like to think they undertake for their own good purposes inventing agriculture outlawing certain plants writing books in praise of others are mere contingencies as far as nature is concerned our desires are simply more grist for evolutions mill no different from a change in the weather a peril for some species an opportunity for others our grammar might teach us to divide the world into active subjects and passive objects but in a coevolutionary relationship every subject is also an object every object a subject thats why it makes just as much sense to think of agriculture as something the grasses did to people as a way to conquer the trees

7430124 mr russell was an appreciator who liked to share his enthusiasms as a consequence some readers and fellow critics found him too genteel
7430125 there are artists whose work i dread to see yet again dance dramas that in my view have set back the american psyche several hundred years composers whose names drive me from the concert hall authors whose books i shall never willingly reopen but it has never seemed to me much of an ambition to go though life snarling and spewing
7430126 when i first began writing my aims as a critic were simple i wanted to persuade people to go and see things that i myself liked

7430136 for half of its lifetime venus could have been a habitable planet with liquid water oceans
7430137 earth life could have been transplanted to venus and it would have landed on a wet planet
7430138 conversely its even possible that earth life came from venus
7430139 we know at least locally and regionally where we have bits of older terrain that poke up through the volcanic plains
7430140 all of a sudden venus may go from a place where we thought life never had a chance to take hold to possibly a real player in the story of life in our solar system and the evolution of habitable planets
7430141 if thats true then the two warm and wet bodies in the early solar system would have been earth and venus and as far as a place for the origin of life venus was equally favourable to earth venus may be the closer analog to early earth
7430142 if we get into the 2 billion year range in timescale then you could imagine that more complex evolution happened not just an origin of life but time for interesting evolutionary development
7430143 it is not life as we generally think about it
7430144 they are just sitting there surviving hoping that the ice will melt
7430145 one possible explanation for the heterogeneous distribution of methane in the mars atmosphere would be surviving sub surface methanogens
7430146 the main reason for this is that most of the planets and moons in our solar system are icy worlds
7430147 thus any type of survival mechanism and possible avenue for metabolism in cold and very cold environments would be a great evolutionary trait for any organism on an icy world
7430148 we have another mechanism of life support in an environment that would otherwise seem to be inhospitable
7430149 the chemical signature of a class of organic compounds called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can be seen in the way they absorb light from distant stars the molecules are thought to leave a complex pattern of dark bands in these spectra called diffuse interstellar bands dibs
7430150 this will be the first time that we can actually have a telescope with the characteristics we can determine
7430151 the only source of noise is the cosmic microwave background
7430152 the ata will do for radio astronomy what sloan has done for optical astronomy
7430153 the telescope is built so that both projects can go on simultaneously
7430154 ill also have some time when i can say all right now seti is going to decide where to point the telescope
7430155 you can buy one for 100 000 and have your name put on it
7430156 the ideal thing would be to make the remaining dishes in say two 150 lots over successive years we can do 150 a year it would be nice to have it done in a couple of years
7430157 when it comes to habitability super earths are our best destination
7430158 protesters damaged at least five vehicles two in rourkela and three in the coastal district of balasore
7430159 neither passenger nor goods trains were allowed to move from stations
7430160 protesters damaged at least five vehicles two in rourkela and three in the coastal district of balasore
7430161 we can only imagine that it might look something like a beefy neptune like planet or perhaps a saturn like planet with rings and moons around it
7430162 the gas giant planets in our solar system all have large moons
7430163 if there is a moon orbiting this new massive planet it might have pools of liquid water on a rocky surface
7430164 we have no evidence of any moon at all nor rings around this planet
7430165 is there perhaps a much smaller terrestrial sized planet lurking in that gap one that might be habitable
7430166 we dont know that sun like stars are necessarily the best for intelligent life but they are certainly a decent starting point given that we know of at least one civilisation around such a star
7430167 its on the list but i dont think it will be given any special treatment
7430168 its still a matter of speculation on just what range of stars could host habitable planets we will eventually get around to observing all of the stars on the list
7430169 assuming that these stars have planets and those planets have life then you have given more time for that life to evolve
7430170 if there is life there and intelligent life then they havent
7430171 whether water is necessary for life is i think very dubious
7430172 life on earth learned to work with water because its the only liquid that is really abundant i dont think theres anything magic about it
7430173 the dogma a few decades ago was that enzymes wouldnt work at all in non aqueous media
7430174 but under some conditions enzymes can be very active in liquids other than water and that has been surprising
7430175 we havent yet established the limits of enzyme function in terms of the range of liquids temperatures and pressures in which enzymes will work
7430176 you can imagine minor differences but the hammer of biological selection is powerful stuff and the best comes out the pipe
7430177 even if its built by different atoms i bet the cellular machinery will still look familiar
7430178 if theres life on titan its probably quite exotic quite different from life on earth
7430179 we would have to refine our understanding so we know what to look for
7430180 if you look at environments where there isnt any oxygen and trace water then silicon chemistry becomes more plausible
7430181 if you reached out with your space glove it could feel living flexible floppy
7430182 but im not at all optimistic about finding non carbon life
7430183 we know that enzymes can catalyse reactions in the vapour phase
7430184 no one has ever duplicated the controls of the lr response on mars without resorting to biology
7430185 except the by product is not h 2 o like on earth its h 2 o 2
7430186 when you heat those poor little suckers they pop and the h 2 o 2 oxidises all of the organics in the cells
7430187 they are only harsh solvents once water gets into the act
7430188 dry sulphuric acid and dry hydrogen fluoride are very mild solvents if anything
7430189 the magnetic minerals contained within it lock in a record of earths magnetic field direction and strength
7430190 just how different a planetary body looks without a global magnetic field is shown by our two nearest neighbours the moon and mars
7430191 both had magnetic fields 4 billion years ago however their fields died probably because their cooling planetary cores no longer convected vigorously enough without shielding from the solar wind they lost most of their atmospheres
7430192 the onset of a magnetic shield around earth is a burning question
7430193 not least because bombardment by energetic extraterrestrial particles such as those of the solar wind might have caused genetic mutations that influenced the evolution of early life on earth
7430194 where we thought molecules could never form were finding them where we thought molecules could never survive theyre surviving
7430195 it shows that there is much more to be learnt about the use of old stars as laboratories for studying interstellar chemistry
7430196 this is just the beginning of a new era in interstellar chemistry
7430197 and its at the right distance from its star for liquid water to possibly exist on its surface
7430198 in the case of mars the surface is a very nasty place to be
7430199 if theyre frozen in the ice they could be brought back to animation with a bit of warmth and nutrients
7430200 it would be wonderful to dig deeply into the martian surface but were not really there yet with the technology to do so
7430201 you have to bring up a very deep core or glassify the sides of the hole
7430202 will you be able to see the kinds of things youre looking to analyse
7430203 if you go to an area that you know has water on mars you have to have a level of cleanliness we may not know how to achieve yet
7430204 there are special regions we wont go because we worry about tracking something into them
7430205 im very interested in the radiation environment and the interplay between the physical features of the solar system and the materials of the solar system
7430206 terrestrial meteorites have a good chance of survival especially those hitting the moon at relatively low velocities and at shallow angles
7430207 we might be able to find rocks that reveal the conditions under which life arose on our planet
7430208 you can actually measure gradients and identify the source of these gases
7430209 it fills in a gap between a lander or rover and at the other extreme an orbiter
7430210 its a good way to go sniffing out point sources
7430211 were seeing that in fact there is water vapour at the right place
7430212 this came as a bit of a surprise to us
7430213 it has a lot of the hallmarks for how we define life at present but we have not simulated life
7430214 to us theyre just a special form of plasma crystal
7430215 some people have argued that life is a self organising system that is out of equilibrium but you could say that of a hurricane
7430216 what these guys have done is one step up from pointing at a hurricane and saying its a living organism they argue theres a way this can store information which is a central feature of life but its somewhat disappointing that this is only theoretical work
7430217 claiming that something is or is not alive is almost pointless because there is no mathematically rigorous definition of life
7430218 in our solar system the places most likely to have the right conditions are planetary rings especially the rings of uranus
7430219 i cannot imagine this will happen in space on a large enough scale to be observable
7430220 to me thats a clear indication that water is there
7430221 i think this is the first time weve had strong evidence that theres water in at least one extrasolar planet
7430222 its not a place you or i would want to visit
7430223 hes certainly shown that its a better fit with water absorption than without
7430224 i think even the most sceptical person would say that
7430225 the outer part might have melted or possibly disintegrated but the interior portion might be rather better preserved
7430226 unlike things like dna that decompose quite quickly these have long term stability over millions or even billions of years
7430227 this experiment is really designed to look at fossil biomarkers rather than living ones
7430228 but the more you know about the survival of organic molecules in general the more you can understand whether living things could survive as well
7430229 this is important for the search for recent or past life forms on other planets
7430230 m stars dont produce a lot of ultraviolet once they quiet down so you dont need an oxygen layer to shield life from the ultraviolet
7430231 and its just at the right distance from its star for liquid water to possibly exist on its surface
7430232 if you take an average value for the amount of starlight heating the planet you get something like 20 c
7430233 on the treasure map of the universe one would be tempted to mark this planet with an x
7430234 because of its temperature and relative proximity this planet will most probably be a very important target of the future space missions dedicated to the search for extraterrestrial life
7430235 but in a comet the clay particles and liquid water are intermixed with lifes building blocks for one or two million years
7430236 most galactic comets are never going to come anywhere near earth
7430237 it was not in any way a conclusive workshop or meant to be
7430238 someone at the meeting pointed out that what a rover can survey in a year a geologist could do in 20 seconds
7430239 a 20 second mission to the moon might not be cost effective but if you can ask enough 20 second questions it might be worth it
7430240 historically the uk hasnt been involved in human spaceflight and we are content with our decision not to fund the international space station
7430241 we want to bring back samples from mars so they can be analysed with the powerful means we have on earth
7430242 is the moon going to become the 8th continent or the 51st state
7430243 in other words are we all going to explore it together or are we going to leave it to nasa
7430244 we have been invited but europe has 17 science ministers who still need to be persuaded
7430245 if mars had early life there is no doubt that it was able to survive the pressures of impact ejection
7430246 did mars have a period where it was teeming with bacteria that is a quite different question
7430247 so many people wrote me emails hundreds saying why dont you image cydonia tell us the truth we dont believe nasa
7430248 my grandfather used to collect pieces of wood that look like birds or dogs or things like that
7430249 this is the same thing people get excited and see what they want to see what has modelled these reliefs is simply erosion
7430250 its a mountainous structure and theres no artificial thing these are mounds that have survived a general erosional process
7430251 were looking at the original structures of organic objects that formed long before the earth formed
7430252 concerns range from worries about potential existential danger all the way to a desire for consensus about what should be said in such messages
7430253 a stunt that has got some serious scientists rather alarmed
7430254 we just may find life to be a bit different from life on earth
7430255 this race is still too tight and many of our members are for this guy mccain
7430256 its too close weve got to fight like hell we even have to fight with some of our own members
7430257 people want change and we are going to do everything within our power to make that happen
7430258 brothers and sisters we have to turn around america if we have four more years of george bush and john mccain america wont have a prayer
7430259 my father is waiting to go back to work this fall to continue to be the voice of americas workers in the united states senate
7430260 what is unique in our study is that this microbial community doesnt depend on photosynthetic products
7430261 sulphate and hydrogen gas are generated from geological processes microbes use these nutrients to live
7430262 they might be the most likely places to find life in the galaxy
7430263 i expect that life signatures utilising chemical materials and co 2 for growth might be found
7430264 it is only for the nearby transiting planets that we can precisely measure the size and mass of the planet and hence study its composition
7430265 it might mean that there are strong winds or other ways of distributing the energy across the planet
7430266 no one has really got a firm detection of that before
7430267 gets so large that the atmosphere cannot hold it anymore
7430268 it is possible there could be long term corrosive effects that would impact crews and equipment
7430269 we know that meteorites can escape the gravity well of large planets
7430270 as the days pass im getting more and more convinced that these are exceedingly unusual biological cells
7430271 it gives us an absolutely calibrated measure of the earths reflectance
7430272 that means that earthshine can be used to precisely determine earths reflectance in a way thats inexpensive
7430273 i still see no confirming evidence for the large recent variations in earthshine measurements
7430274 the basic idea is that we can learn a lot about the targets that were looking for if we practise by looking at the earth
7430275 congress and the administration need to come together and recognise the mismatch between what nasa is being asked to do and what theyre being provided the resources to do
7430276 they upset the balance and the stability of the science programme
7430277 there are things you stop then you later wish you could start up again but they evaporate in the meanwhile
7430278 the impact of these cost overruns has done so much damage to upset the balance of the programme
7430279 stems from the lack of an effective internal advisory structure
7430280 there is a kind of wise use of human resources and programmes that seems to be missing in this budget
7430281 they did it in a hurry and without consulting the community in how to make the impact the least bad
7430282 the gloomy side comes from the parameters the subcommittees are working under
7430283 the overall budget is not going to change so you cant come back with the recommendation that we want to do everything and we just need more money
7430284 the positive side is that nasa appears very ready to take comment from the community
7430285 this is the first time that all these different shapes have been documented and theyre quite distinct
7430286 this is more than just evidence of possible life it is evidence of biodiversity that life had a firm foothold by 3 4 billion years ago so that it pounced as soon as the opportunity arose
7430287 genetic control of morphology in fact requires the demonstration of near constancy of form under different conditions
7430288 we have simulated similar structures in the laboratory entirely without microbes
7430289 the evidence for the presence of life seems to me irrefutable
7430290 this is not a primary reason to go back to the moon there are very strong scientific reasons for going back but if we go back to the moon in the next 20 or 30 years then amongst those things we might like to keep our eyes open for are alien artefacts
7430291 on the moon i think its certainly worthwhile taking a couple hundred square feet or so of material and looking it over
7430292 people have gone through the samples in excruciating detail and havent found anything that would suggest extraterrestrial activity
7430293 the sun here is so strong people start walking around and realize they need a hat
7430294 i sometimes wonder whats the most mind boggling thing that could happen during my lifetime
7430295 we figured a cafe was a place where people could gather congregate recharge and connect
7430296 one might as well speculate on the origin of matter
7430297 might look a lot like ours did billions of years ago before life arose on earth
7430298 for many years i wouldve described myself as having moderate republican leanings
7430299 those of us on the democratic side know you can call them and ask them for thoughts advice connections money and theyre always helpful
7430300 for many years i wouldve described myself as having moderate republican leanings
7430301 perhaps the last eight years or so ive tended to be democratic because theyve lined up more with my view of where colorado and the country ought to go
7430302 he is as high a profile as anybody from a pure corporate standpoint
7430303 i came away believing he was an unusual politician and someone who comes along very rarely
7430304 there was only this one place in all the places we can look that arent too dusty that had a composition that was consistent with the alh84001
7430305 putting this all together its all consistent with this being the source region
7430306 there isnt any piece of information that makes this a unique interpretation other than the fact that we havent seen any other suitable places
7430307 no single line of evidence that says ah this is it
7430308 its not like were carrying nuclear weapons and these surfboards arent much heavier than a carry on
7430309 its ridiculous when youre having to pay more for your board than the price of your airline ticket
7430310 without the manufacturers support these guys are dead in the water
7430311 theres no economic model that justifies setting up a support team to support just five planes in the field theres no critical mass to make it economically viable
7430312 were the lighting rod for their ire right now because they got burned by the prior company
7430313 i dont think theres anyone with this company that doesnt sympathize with them but it is not our responsibility to support these owners
7430314 the previous company is responsible for putting them in the position theyre in today
7430315 if this situation impacts safety of flight for the a500 aircraft the faa will take action to assure the design continues to be compliant with faa regulations and include no unsafe conditions
7430316 when youre putting wheat on the ground theres going to be a loss
7430317 they dont ever like to put it on the ground but when wheat is 7 8 or 10 a bushel they sure dont like to put it on the ground
7430318 were way way behind in our infrastructure investment both in the private sector and publicly
7430319 and we need to move a lot on that or we will see other countries supplant us as they get greater investment in their infrastructure
7430320 in my opinion theres no way in my lifetime that nasa will find a way of drilling a borehole 150 metres deep on mars
7430321 but the borehole is just looking at whats been thrown out of a crater
7430322 so finding them in a dry place is not what everyone would have expected
7430323 the problem is not the faintness of the planets but their proximity to stars that are 10 billion times brighter
7430324 its not part of the telescope but rather something that prepares the sky to be examined by the telescope
7430325 but this has such important implications someone should be doing it
7430326 forms a cushion damping the effect of these crazy chaotic orbits
7430327 but with the right conditions you can get giant planets in the interior and habitable terrestrial planets on the exterior
7430328 we still dont know what is a realistic mechanism for stopping the migration
7430329 artificial structures may be the best way for an advanced extraterrestrial civilisation to signal its presence to an emerging technology like ours
7430330 arnolds proposal falls within the category of sett the search for extraterrestrial technology
7430331 sett is entirely complementary to seti which is narrowly defined as the search for electromagnetic emissions from other technological societies the seti league actively encourages and enthusiastically endorses such research
7430332 to our big surprise everything went fine after the flight
7430333 the lichens were in exactly the same shape as before flight
7430334 the faint stars are harder to see but they make up 85 of all stars in the galaxy and three quarters of those are single
7430335 i think the result strongly favours the idea that most stars form initially as single objects not in multiple systems
7430336 you can certainly form a lot of stars that way but with so many single red dwarfs theres no simple way
7430337 the mechanism doesnt work unless one always breaks apart a pair of red dwarfs
7430338 it means the majority of stars in the galaxy and the universe forms under considerably more quiescent conditions than have been promoted in some quarters
7430339 if ladas results hold up a lot of people who have made rash claims in the past will have to re evaluate their positions
7430340 those factors together make the stars very likely sites for the formation of planets and life
7430341 in that case travelling to a habitable planet or making one by terraforming around a red dwarf star could extend the lifetime of the human race by many many billions of years
7430342 if we had done nothing else these findings alone would have made the cassini mission worthwhile
7430343 this result is encouraging for a possible preservation of mineral biotic calcite structures on mars for billions of years
7430344 the older materials are the more likely theyve been overprinted by many many processes
7430345 it can garble the signal so much its hard to tell much about it at all
7430346 detecting evidence of life on mars is probably going to be very difficult so investigating every reasonable possible avenue makes sense
7430347 there is nothing contentious about the maths of this but the result is surprising
7430348 we will fold these ideas into our analysis of how we plan to confirm our planet detections
7430349 we plan to look at each system three times during darwins five year mission
7430350 in that time comets will change brightness and move on highly elliptical orbits but planets will not so i dont think there will be any confusion
7430351 these grains are probably the signpost of an asteroid belt around 25 times more massive than that orbiting our own sun
7430352 were really interested in understanding more about the asteroid belts of mature stars because they tell us more about our own sun and whether our own planetary system is the norm or exceptional
7430353 if our eyes were sensitive to infrared light vegetation would blind us its as reflective as metal
7430354 for 80 to 85 of the time life has been on earth its just been microbes
7430355 if theres a parallel on other planets it takes a long time for multi cellular life to develop the signature of these microbes or vegetation might be detectable
7430356 theres no question its going to be a challenging observation
7430357 its not obvious that if you started up life on a different planet that it would actually discover the chlorophyll molecule and this photosynthetic mechanism
7430358 if we could get a really clean signature of that red edge and feel fairly confident were not being fooled by strange rocks or other surface materials it would be a really strong indication of life
7430359 we have incredibly sensitive radio telescopes even a single cellphone on a plane 100 miles away could cause pretty serious damage
7430360 putting cellphones in a plane is like building a cellphone tower 40 000 feet high
7430361 could survive and potentially grow under the high martian uv flux if water and nutrient requirements for growth were met
7430362 we think there are places on mars where earth life could make a living
7430363 i think it was common to believe that finding one or the other was enough to say there was life
7430364 it looks like brain coral but its mushy its totally cool these reefs are like some of the first kinds made on earth
7430365 the possibility of transporting a replicating life form to earth where it is found to have a negative effect on some aspect of earths ecosystem
7430366 if life is found in any sample it must be assumed to be hazardous until proven otherwise
7430367 for the first time we are beginning to find our planetary kin among the stars
7430368 we actually have no direct information about the chemical or mineral composition of the planet nor do we know if its primarily rocky like earth or a combination of rock ice and gas
7430369 because the planet is in a two day orbit heated to oven like temperatures we do not expect life
7430370 theres a very significant increase required but i think its premature to draw conclusions about a biological source
7430371 but it does establish for the first time that there are other mechanisms for producing oxidants
7430372 it doesnt look to me like you have enough dust activity to produce the electric fields you want to produce
7430373 but its probably the best idea if we really do need an additional mechanism for destroying methane in the atmosphere
7430374 billions of tonnes of material have come from mars to earth over geological time
7430375 would really seem to suggest the planets have not been biologically isolated
7430376 a key question is when this chirality came into play
7430377 somehow only the proteins of left handed amino acids survived
7430378 we say the molecular building blocks of life were already created in interstellar conditions
7430379 going towards greater realism by exploring another wavelength of light and solid samples is definitely a good thing and a logical step forward
7430380 if it is thanks to meteorites that our amino acids are left handed then the same bias should exist at least across our solar system
7430381 the chiral amino acids might have been delivered to other planets to other solar systems
7430382 the probability that life arose somewhere else is increased with this experimental result
7430383 if we identify left handed amino acids on the cometary surface this would underline the hypothesis that the building blocks of proteins were created in interstellar space and were delivered via comets or micrometeorites to early earth
7430384 mars is wetter warmer more interesting and more diverse than we thought
7430385 should assign high priority to defining and obtaining measurements needed to identify
7430386 eventually i hope we will have numbers for at least upper limits for hydrogen

7430404 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding
7430405 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish and through trial and error i finally settled on type of spit for the task at hand
7430406 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7430407 i had a go at murray mints and found they worked a treat
7430408 for the first time as i dived to gather the ball at square leg i landed on my side and a shower of murray mints spewed out of my trouser pocket all over the grass right in front of the umpire
7430409 fortunately neither he nor the two batsmen seemed to take much notice as i scrambled around on all fours trying desperately to gather in the sweets before they started asking awkward questions

7430418 once the game is over yes i am interested in what happens with them but more importantly we have to worry about ourselves
7430419 right now were playing and we are having good times but also we are having some down times too like yesterday
7430420 i just need to feel comfortable at the plate feel my legs and once i feel my legs the results they will come
7430421 i feel all right its all right i feel better from the right side than i do the left side
7430422 theres no tomorrow so you do what you have to do
7430423 there will be times where its three days or four days in a row as long as i can help the team thats the most important thing
7430424 down the stretch thats something we might have to do
7430425 its not what you want to do but if you get in the situation sometimes you have to do it we needed some outs mo said he felt fine and he was able to give us four outs
7430426 theres still two outs so he has to get a single to score third base he can stay there
7430427 he said he had just normal soreness that a starter would have
7430428 you have a young pitcher hes 27 years old and hes trying to pitch hes different than what he was earlier in the season as far as velocity and that type of thing but john maine wants to pitch and wants to gut it out and we have been assured that he cant injure himself any more than he has
7430429 i think if we do that i would think it would be a complete shutdown
7430430 i guess shutting it down is an option but jerry asked me what i wanted to do and i want to pitch
7430431 theres two months left in the season and i hope i can get through it
7430432 im concerned about the big plays that got called back ive seen thomas run against us in
7430433 i think we have a great combination with our two backs i think we have an outstanding line its just how quickly our chemistry can come together
7430434 coaches may say okay guys im not going to let you sit out this game but i want you to practice i say heck if im going to practice im going to play at least a series otherwise its really a long time until you play another game
7430435 to george m steinbrenner and the steinbrenner family whose loyalty to the less fortunate of the world has allowed me to do what i do
7430436 when you read the book youll understand what he means what he means to kids what hes done for the underprivileged
7430437 this is the only way i can honor him i will continue to honor him
7430438 the people that we call the haters would in essence take shots at me and steinbrenner would always tell me its just jealousy fight it
7430439 he would jump my butt if he ever heard me talking down about myself
7430440 he wrote me a letter saying that the book rated on top with his world championships
7430441 i keep that letter in my wallet its my most prized possession
7430442 from a puerto rican caught doing graffiti to speaking at columbia university
7430443 if the giants make a sincere overture its a good chance that strahan would consider coming back
7430444 there are other things he has to take into consideration the money and his contract with fox but if the giants really want him they have a shot its not out of the question
7430445 i havent heard from anybody else so to say if i would or wouldnt is premature
7430446 im sure michael is happy with fox but he obviously loves the giants too
7430447 if theyre interested in talking to him hed discuss it with them but right now as i see it youll be watching him on fox this year
7430448 i dont want to hit all my home runs in the preseason but its what i plan to do
7430449 i wasnt mad but i just said id like to get a score
7430450 i dont think what any team has done in the history of the nfl will have any effect on what we do this year
7430451 but we continue to adjust we picked up luis ayala when billy went down and hes been fine but the reality is there are no starting pitchers or closers out there for trades its tough for us to make waiver claims because there are two other teams in our own division looking to block us
7430452 theres not much we can do weve got to fill in from within
7430453 and weve been assured he cant injure himself any further but were in a pennant race here and weve got to do whats best for him and for the team
7430454 were just going to have to find the guy whos hot
7430455 this was painful youre at that time in the 10th inning when youre figuring matchups and all of a sudden youre down two runs because we didnt do a good job of execution so far as keeping balls in the ballpark

7430817 i dont know where anton is in terms of signing for sunderland but once the club accept the bid it moves on

7430821 we have a lot to learn but the idea of coaching against him and having a chance to beat him is great

7430826 internet bullying has emerged as a new and growing form of social cruelty
7430827 youth harassed online were significantly more likely to also report two or more detentions or suspensions and skipping school in the previous year
7430828 especially concerning youth who reported being targeted by internet harassment were eight times more likely than all other youth to concurrently report carrying a weapon to school in the past 30 days
7430829 the anonymity provided by new technology limits a victim from responding in a way that may ordinarily stop a peers aggressive behavior or influence the probability of future acts which provides an advantage to the perpetrator
7430830 the primary recommendation we have for parents is to talk to their kids
7430831 talk to them about where they go on the internet appropriate standards of behavior
7430832 they can make social connections that they otherwise might not have the opportunity to make
7430833 i think its that drive and the will to win
7430834 they just like to compete and be the absolute best at whatever they do
7430835 what is it i think its a god given talent not only in yourself but those around you and those you watch video of eagle valley faith christian football watch video fountain fort carson ralston valley football watch video of thomas jefferson monarch football watch video of first day of fall practice watch highlights of the latest prep action view a gallery of slide shows from prep sports across colorado discuss high school sports and uncover tidbits on the all things colorado preps blog discuss high school sports in a tailor made forum choose to support you and how you treat them

7430837 we threw everything we had at him and must have knocked him out of the game three or four times and every time we did he would come right back in
7430838 we basically worked on his footwork an some other real basic stuff of the quarterback position
7430839 you get to that point where you know what you have to do but it sure makes a big difference when you dont have to carry the whole load by yourself
7430840 but we have that something extra driving us this season
7430841 this team is already tighter and will use this as motivation they are playing with a lot of heart

7430850 this reckless approach demonstrates why the home office remains unfit for purpose
7430851 too ready criminalisation of children and young people for minor offences
7430852 the increased use of pre court summary justice is one of the most important elements in the governments strategy for modernising the criminal justice system
7430853 the implementation of the strategy has received virtually no research inspectoral or parliamentary scrutiny
7430854 labours ad hoc and distorted approach has created the worst of both worlds
7430855 not only are serious offenders escaping real justice due to the reliance on spot fines but as this report shows many people who should be dealt with informally are being criminalised he said
7430856 the public are sick and tired of this government pursuing easy targets instead of going after the real criminals this report also shows how labour went into headfirst into this reform without carrying out proper research
7430857 this reckless approach demonstrates why the home office remains unfit for purpose
7430858 the best way to avoid a criminal record is not to break the law the law abiding majority want to see crimes dealt with effectively and fixed penalty notices and cautions are part of this process
7430859 they allow police to deal swiftly with low level offending freeing them up to spend more time on frontline duties and more time investigating violent dangerous and serious offences
7430860 we are perturbed at the lack of interest by city management in cleaning up vacant buildings
7430861 its time for a change i may be old but i am an old person who believes in young ideas
7430862 i was probably the most visible hillary supporter there was
7430863 she didnt win i can accept that and i think most people are accepting that
7430864 bottom line we as a party cant afford another bush kind of term
7430865 i liked hillary i saw what she went through with the republicans and she didnt cave in
7430866 but i am not about to vote republican because she isnt the nominee
7430867 to tell you the truth i had no idea how it is supposed to be spelled
7430868 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget
7430869 if the departments can cut their budgets a minimum of 5 percent maybe we can use reserves to stem the tide a while until we get a handle of whats going on
7430870 the council has eliminated some items and added others that werent included in the budget

7430877 illness can signify the loss of ones plans and even dreams but most often people who live with invisible illness find a new purpose they would not have imagined under any other set of circumstances
7430878 i had always planned to work for a nonprofit doing something to help others but i never felt i was efficient or empathetic enough because i had not walked in the shoes of those i served now through my illness ministry and books on aspects of coping with illness i have the chance to use what i experience each day to reach out to others its my hope that they will also find hope despite their illness as they discover that new sense of purpose in the pain
7430879 though we live with thousands of different illnesses we have more in common than not for example illness impacts our families careers finances and daily living to name a few we can all learn from one another and share during this journey
7430880 and frankly people are tired of hearing but you look so good and they want others to know that their illness is legitimate despite how well they seem to be holding it all together
7430881 life disrupted getting real about chronic illness in your twenties and thirties
7430882 when you are a young adult people expect you to put in long hours to establish a career to jump into the dating world and to build a life for yourself but they certainly dont expect you to be sick theres no such thing as too young to be sick that is just one of the many reasons why invisible illness week is so important
7430883 no sabemos si el suministro de sustancias por otra persona es un acto directo de crimen y por tanto castigado no hay un solo caso en los tribunales a pesar de que se admiten que al menos mil personas en espa a mueren al a o por eutanasia directa que haya sido requerido por asistir a un enfermo la actitud de las autoridades es un tanto hip crita ya que por un lado mantienen el castigo pero por otro son reacias a perseguirlo
7430884 vivir con sufrimiento f sico es m s que un castigo es una condici n irreconciliable con la vida ticamente respetar la decisi n de enfermo es garantizar su propia autonom a cuando una persona est enferma el grado de autonom a disminuye por este motivo hay que ofrecer las garant as para que esta persona pueda elegir libremente lo que quiera
7430885 nosotros junto con apoyarlo le ofrecimos asesor a jur dica ram n establece un antes y un despu s en la lucha por la dignidad en el proceso final de la vida
7430886 una muerte digna no es lo mismo que eutanasia ya que esta pr ctica consiste en realizar actos que van directos a producir la muerte de una persona muy distintos son las acciones encaminadas a disminuir el dolor y el sufrimiento y que ayuden a que la muerte natural se produzca dignamente y con el menor sufrimiento posible
7430887 en chile hace falta hablar sobre el dolor y sufrimiento como un factor que forma parte de la vida humana y que tratamos de evitarlo por todos los medios incluso en la infancia de esta manera estamos negando la vida un sufrimiento no necesariamente mata puede hacer crecer a la persona la muerte es algo natural y en ese sentido tenemos que profundizar lo que significa vivir en todos los aspectos incluido el dolor como elemento de vida
7430888 como si morir sin dolor fuese un obsequio es falaz esa servidumbre inevitable a personas resueltas a impedirnos la muerte
7430889 la locuci n derecho a morir es emblem tica no s lo de nuestra frivolidad respecto al suicidio y nuestro anhelo de m dicos buenos que nos maten en el momento oportuno y del modo correcto sino m s fundamentalmente del repudio de nuestra autopropiedad corporal y las responsabilidades que la acompa an

7430898 theres no question that we need a new filmhouse and the council needs to play a central part in that
7430899 provided we filmed the da vinci code with buckets of irony i thought it would have all the makings of a popular fast paced thriller
7430900 i stopped acting in movies when what billy connolly calls a bunch of effing foetuses in three piece suits began to call the shots
7430901 my first big break came when i was five years old
7430902 its taken me more than 70 years to realise that
7430903 for someone who is a private person who also happens to be a public figure i am a very easy target
7430904 many people read the bond stories and think this is just fantasy this is nonsense but ive gone through all the books and actually fleming used a lot of genuine stuff
7430905 yes theres plenty that is fantastical and glamorous but in terms of the basics its very very accurate

7430907 shoot german crew dump overboard and bring the rescue boat back to english port
7430908 fleming had this incredible ability to think out of the box and people like him were extremely important to the war effort in fact the head of naval intelligence vice admiral john godfrey was so enamoured with his talent that he once said fleming should have been the director and he should have been his assistant
7430909 we want images used in the marketing campaign not only to show the beauty of airlie but to depict the integrated coastal lifestyle offered by a tempo lifestyle development

7430911 we are fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion the stage where the government is free to do anything it pleases while citizens may act only by permission which is the stage of the darkest periods of human history
7430912 the whole kennedy family will be in a special section
7430913 he that is of the opinion money will do everything may well be suspected of doing everything for money
7430914 poverty is now one of the greatest dangers faced by our children
7430915 if poverty were an infection we would be in the midst of a full scale epidemic
7430916 nothing travels faster than the speed of light with the possible exception of bad news which obeys its own special laws
7430917 a jury consists of twelve persons chosen to decide who has the better lawyer
7430918 strength does not come from physical capacity it comes from an indomitable will
7430919 the opportunity to get these animals out of seaworld and the educational opportunities it would provide would be well worth it to us

7430921 i hold it the inalienable right of anybody to go to hell in his own way
7430922 a lot of institutions as well as students and families are looking for ways to get through college without leaving students with additional debt
7430923 its not just another year they dont have to pay its also another year to earn
7430924 terrorism is the tactic of demanding the impossible and demanding it at gunpoint
7430925 sarah is very keen that the girls should live normal lives but she would definitely back them carrying out charity work in an official capacity
7430926 at 20 years of age the will reigns at 30 the wit at 40 the judgment
7430927 it was no longer about saving the country but about stopping the crimes
7430928 its not the finish i had imagined but i am slowly coming to terms with whats happened over the last 24 hours
7430929 the realisation that i had just played my last game for the knights was very overwhelming and the thought of not putting on my red and blue no 9 jersey ever again was really hard to comprehend
7430930 i was looking forward to a huge game against the storm this week in one of my favourite games of the year in front of the old boys and our loyal fans one last time
7430931 i know the boys will be doing everything they can to give newcastle a shot at the finals and are up to the challenge against last years premiers
7430932 with the world cup at the end of the year i felt my goal of playing for australia one last time was within reach as well but it just wasnt meant to be
7430933 i have had a great run in the representative arena over the years and im proud of what i have achieved
7430934 the memories i take with me and the friendships i have formed will last a life time
7430935 not many great players get to go out on their terms and i really feel for danny he deserves so much better
7430936 danny has been the ultimate club man and achieved everything the game has to offer to see his career end in the confines of a doctors room is cruel
7430937 the contribution danny has made to rugby league and the city of newcastle is enormous
7430938 i remember him coming to the club as a skinny little half from taree to watch not only what he has achieved but more so the way he went about it is a credit to a rugby league icon
7430939 he leaves a lasting legacy and will be remembered as one of the all time greats of the game
7430940 only a place like newcastle could give you the welcome home we got that night
7430941 winning the premiership and then the trip back up the f3 was the highest of highs and walking into the packed stadium was incredible something i will never forget
7430942 the feeling i got that night stayed with me and motivated me for all these years to train week in week out to reach that pinnacle again

7430949 so what are you expecting from obama if hes in office not that the other puppet is better
7430950 we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7430951 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7430952 the beijing olympics were the green olympics high tech olympics and peoples olympics the 16 day sport event has brought enormous joy and enthusiasm to the humanity and has won glory for both the host city beijing and the olympics
7430953 my patient probably would have rather been anywhere else he and his wife were in my office to discuss his erectile dysfunction for the first time
7430954 however with auto makers getting near the end of one model year and getting ready to start the next sales are beginning to show some signs of improving over julys dismal sales performance

7430956 people are not knocking on the door looking to invest billions of dollars in nsw
7430957 certainly electricity is one of the key issues that has to be settled to unblock billions in investment
7430958 thats why theyre beating a path to his mr ofarrells door saying well state a position
7430959 ive heard the business community through the media i understand theyre coming to a meeting with me tomorrow
7430960 i will listen to them as i have listened to others but ultimately as weve said all along were here to determine our position on this matter on whats best for the state
7430961 by my count thats about 20 pages to read and about 30 calls to make but after four days and counting mr ofarrell still hasnt uttered a word
7430962 hes either making no effort at all or simply misleading the public either way hes taking the community for granted
7430963 the greens felt very strongly that this will be a highly significant test of the opposition leaders environmental and economic credibility
7430964 his ability to resist lobbying from his friends in big business will be on trial
7430965 i am a chinese and i consider myself a very patriotic person
7430966 telephone lines at our call centre handling telephone transactions of stocks and bonds were jammed with many inquiries from our customers
7430967 our presales survey on investors showed that it would be difficult to sell the bonds with the planned yield
7430968 a party that took a long time coming but was over in a jiffy
7430969 but the highest tribute is due to the human spirit so beautifully presented in the opening and closing ceremonies
7430970 so long birds nest water cube chaoyang park and tiananmen square hello wembley wimbledon piccadilly circus and trafalgar square
7430971 this olympics have been very successful and this shows that china can no longer be seen in the same light anymore
7430972 i have felt like a bird with broken wings falling into a deep valley
7430973 many taiwanese believe the former president has salted away more money than has been revealed thus far
7430974 for right now were looking like were able to contain the infection
7430975 that gave us a leg up not to need a learning curve to figure out what to do
7430976 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
7430977 we dont want this matter getting in to the media
7430978 there is blood everywhere in the unit we have told police its you how do you feel about that
7430979 the accused person is actively trying to deceive police by inferring other people were involved in the matter
7430980 if there is any breach of bail he could be spending a long time in custody
7430981 the young men who come in from outer suburbs to drink alcohol and assault gay people are not going to be deterred by a sticker in a window
7430982 because they already have homophobic and violent tendencies its more likely to be a provocation
7430983 lots of people in the gay and lesbian community fear it will provoke more violence weve had enough of these pr stunts
7430984 if people get away with homophobic abuse there is a strong risk that they move on to and violence
7430985 we must stop it before it gets to that stage
7430986 we could have used two more quality starters darn it
7430987 a couple of quality starters and two relievers including a closer darn it
7430988 one of the one or two best moments of my career
7430989 quintanilla shows up and hits a no brainer there that was very appropriate for that to happen for him today he shows up every day and is the ultimate professional i have never heard him complain about anything
7430990 im just concentrating on my job seriously the other stuff will take care of itself
7430991 i think we are all really comfortable in our roles now
7430992 i think thats made a difference i think were all in a good place
7430993 i thought he was very very deliberate with his tempo today
7430994 for me it was another outing without his best stuff he battled to keep us in the ballgame so there is growth there
7430995 by the same token were prone to overestimate our own agency in nature many of the activities humans like to think they undertake for their own good purposes inventing agriculture outlawing certain plants writing books in praise of others are mere contingencies as far as nature is concerned our desires are simply more grist for evolutions mill no different from a change in the weather a peril for some species an opportunity for others our grammar might teach us to divide the world into active subjects and passive objects but in a coevolutionary relationship every subject is also an object every object a subject thats why it makes just as much sense to think of agriculture as something the grasses did to people as a way to conquer the trees
7430996 first of all i am tired i am true of heart and also you are tired you are true of heart

7431028 we have been receiving messages of condolence from members since the announcement and our close knit profession feels bens loss very deeply
7431029 life has been extremely difficult for them clinic staff since the crisis began and to have this happen on top of all theyve had to deal with will be devastating
7431030 its a coincidence the quarantine is lifted on the day of bens memorial service
7431031 ben loved his career and horses it was a major part of his life and i know he would overjoyed to finally have the ban lifted its just devastating that he cant be here
7431032 we think approximately 15 or 17 people have been saved and we need to confirm it unfortunately it seems the rest of the people on board died
7431033 senator obama took a very strong position against the war in the beginning we would like him to remain opposed to the war and continue to speak on behalf of bringing back the troops immediately
7431034 he worked for palestine and sacrificed for his homeland he killed a jew
7431035 the israeli government is making a big mistake by releasing terrorists now with blood on their hands the first time for many years
7431036 the lesson to the region is that terror pays off
7431037 the guides are experienced people among the best around there was no negligence involved it is just that the mountain is an extremely dangerous environment even for those who know it well
7431038 we slid for 500 metres with the snow before they found us
7431039 the reality is that this is going to be barack obamas week
7431040 we dont have any illusions about the challenges we face in getting our message out but you cant expect people to cover you if you dont show up
7431041 there should be a balance and we want to make sure were available to tell the other side of the story
7431042 dramatisch voor een club als anderlecht financieel lopen ze daardoor heel wat mis en voor de spelers is het natuurlijk ook heel triest ik vind het niet terecht dat hij mij eruit heeft gezet alleen het eerste kwartier was niet zoals het had gemoeten daarna heb ik wel redelijk gespeeld vind ik
7431043 bij groningen zorgde teammanager theo huizinga altijd dat alles voor de spelers goed geregeld was hoe je aan een kaart komt voor een uitwedstrijd moet je hier zelf maar uitzoeken tegen cercle brugge kwam in vorige week in het uitvak terecht
7431044 every member of the australian olympic team in beijing has sacrificed much to represent their country at the highest level and the celebration on september 18 is our chance to say thank you

7431046 a large section of society is unable to own homes owing to spiraling real estate costs the commune has been conceived to fulfill this need gap the starting price for the affordable housing units will be around rs 19 lakh these properties will be on a par with premium developments in terms of quality treatment and amenities
7431047 ever since i turned 35 the battle of the bulge has turned into a rout gut 1 patrick 0
7431048 the syndrome is associated with eight degenerative diseases the first is overweight disorder then high blood pressure high cholesterol and high blood sugar then you have type two diabetes cardiovascular diseases heart attacks and strokes four kinds of cancer breast prostate colon endometrial osteoarthritis and finally gall bladder disease all this is basically because people eat too many carbohydrates thats partly because its the cheapest food and also because the food industry keeps throwing sugar into everything to make it taste good
7431049 healthy cells contain proteins that span the entire charge spectrum from negatively charged proteins to positively charged protein health means that theres a balance between negatively charged proteins and positively charged proteins this is essential for core body health because the 25 000 proteins in the body are its worker bees
7431050 the synthesis of negatively charged proteins continues but the synthesis of positively charged proteins is greatly diminished and this impairs cell function causing further disease all foods made in bulk in nature contain negatively charged proteins things like whey soy casein and egg white and when we get meat at the store its usually muscle which is also mainly negatively charged proteins
7431051 unless of course you eat like your grandparents did tripe kidney or stomach you get much more of a protein balance from organ meat but people dont eat all that much of it anymore
7431052 you could make up for a positively charged protein deficiency by eating protein with an overall negative charge
7431053 eleven are nonessential meaning our body makes them and nine are essential meaning our body doesnt make them and we must get them from our diets as we age there are two things that prevent us from getting those essential amino acids we fall into poor eating habits taking in lots of carbohydrates and less protein rich food and also the aging process interferes with the digestive process leading to further deficiencies in amino acids and positively charged proteins i call this the food chain gap
7431054 by the end of the first week you have more pep and energy
7431055 reset the metabolic pathways and thats why you get more pep and energy plus it burns calories they can even improve mood three of those amino acids are direct precursors to neurotransmitters in the brain two of them are dopamine and serotonin which are related to pleasure this means they can also relieve stress anxiety mood swings and depression because they reach the brain within minutes the amino acids also signal the brains appetite centers that the body is well fed and that leads to feelings of comfort satisfaction and well being
7431056 i used to get three viruses a year but ive been using factor4 weight control for two and a half years and i dont get sick anymore

7431074 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
7431075 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
7431076 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
7431077 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
7431078 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
7431079 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

7431085 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
7431086 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
7431087 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
7431088 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
7431089 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
7431090 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
7431091 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american

7431145 the newspaper is of the view that musharraf proved a poor leader he may have been the best bet for assistance in the war on terror at the time the us sought those ties but his forced resignation leaves quite a political mess
7431146 it will have to be seen if the two of them can govern together or whether they were only able to co operate when battling musharraf
7431147 internationally pakistans blind eye towards terrorists could have fatal consequences for the us and its allies
7431148 if sharif and zardari are to succeed where musharraf could not they have to put aside their petty differences they have to gain the support of the army which though demoralised remains the most powerful force in pakistan they have to convince chief of army staff ashfaq kayani that corralling the isi is important not just for americas priority the war on terror but also for the stability of pakistan and they have to trust general kayani a one time head of the isi to do his job

7431156 those are one a better understanding of the middle east as the key crisis point in the 21st century and two the effective power of non violence
7431157 i want people to think about whether or not we need to re articulate the limits of self defense in the context of the post 9 11 world
7431158 another question i would like people to ask themselves is this if we do need to re articulate self defense does that mean we also need to re articulate international law
7431159 i think on trax it wont be as big of an issue
7431160 but if i was still taking the bus i think that would be a bigger problem
7431161 they may give you a bit of grief or make you pay
7431162 for right now this is the only thing we can do to alleviate the delay
7431163 i guess we didnt take into account the olympics when we ordered them
7431164 theres not much we can do about that right now
7431165 everyone pays in their tuition a transportation fee and this is what its going to
7431166 i ride trax every day and if i had to walk to school it would not be cool so i think its a good use of our tuition
7431167 the new pipes are six inches pre insulated wrapped around with another steel pipe and then coated with a very thick polymer material
7431168 its supposed to last 40 years so we hope to never see the pipe again
7431169 the supply and return of the water runs at different temperatures and can cause it to corrode faster
7431170 when you have that high of pressure it is kept liquid but if it hits the surface it immediately turns to steam and can be quite volatile
7431171 the pipe has two actual barriers to keep out any corrosion
7431172 most people have been pretty good but a few people seem to have a death wish
7431173 were hoping to have a bridge for students to walk across but existing utility work is posing a problem
7431174 well finish as much as we can before snow falls and then finish the rest in spring
7431175 arthritis cancer and lots of things can affect hepcidin levels
7431176 it is hard to diagnose the anemia of chronic disease
7431177 having an assay for hepcidin would make it much easier and it would also help in diagnosing iron overload diseases
7431178 it has the potential to really strengthen media at the u im pleased to have the opportunity to help draft the new bylaws
7431179 the merger of the two councils will allow us to expand media production opportunities for students while still allowing for everyone to retain their independence and autonomy
7431180 however i am concerned about the role that the assistant publisher will play the duties of this position arent clearly stated in the report but i can see this figure becoming a potential threat to the chronicles independence it all depends on how the new bylaws are written
7431181 i can understand their desire to consolidate but some of the positions are worrisome because the minute you have administrator oversight you lose the freedom of press that the chronicle and other student publications have always enjoyed
7431182 the effect of music and fine arts on a whole range of other aspects of childrens lives is tremendously important
7431183 as fine arts are enhanced and developed in our public education you see absenteeism go down you see performance and behavioral problems reduced as well as substantial and demonstrable increases in performance in mathematics in science and in languages the relationship between the arts and these other critical skills is just absolutely clear
7431184 its like a miracle the support we have been getting from the university is like a dream come true
7431185 we are honored our efforts will continue beverley sorensens work and carry her name
7431186 the combination of how to teach and what to teach in the arts is a prospect about which we are extraordinarily excited
7431187 as a family we are touched by the problems that we face in many of our less affluent communities where gangs and other attractions seem to want to steal our youth
7431188 we see this as a great tool in the arsenal against these kinds of destructive things
7431189 i have worked in the human resources field for 30 years and have never before encountered an hr professional of the same caliber as loretta harper
7431190 loretta harper has transformed human resources at the university in myriad ways that have significantly improved our work environment and our benefits
7431191 the highlights of my career have been to provide leadership in a manner that allows others to succeed and reach their full potential
7431192 her work days are not limited to the standard work unpredictable and busy
7431193 it will hopefully speed things up at the reserved desk for the undergrads
7431194 i thought my olympics were over for sure but at that time i almost did not care i was just freaking out because i had no idea what was happening with my body
7431195 the crowds cheered and i remember telling myself ok the worst is over you have three kilometers to go you can do this you can finish you dont have to fail
7431196 i looked to the stadium it was right there i was next to it i saw the olympic flame only i did not know if i was going to make it inside of it
7431197 my body gave up on me but upset as i am right now i think i will with time look back at this experience as perfect too
7431198 i never had to overcome myself like this before the time may not reflect my fitness and ability but it is an official olympic time
7431199 blogging has given me a way to reflect on my experience as i am experiencing it
7431200 it really is wonderful to be able to share this experience with people i care about and who care about me reading their comments or posting something they may find interesting gives me something to look forward to each day i just try to include in my blog a little bit of everything so that everyone can find something interesting to read i am sure a lot of people dont care about my analysis of a particular workout but that is important to me and i know my running friends probably enjoy following that aspect of my experience
7431201 about every few hundred yards if you look hard enough you see people with brooms
7431202 the sidewalks seem completely clean so it just seems a little needless to continue sweeping them and most people who do this seem at quite a different place as they are doing it
7431203 feels kind of like being at a huge conference of something such as teachers of english to speakers of other languages people with badges everywhere only a lot more security
7431204 the focus right now is on getting as much rest as possible
7431205 with marathons the hardest training happens up to three weeks before the race at this time its just fine tuning
7431206 for the managers the pressure is mostly finished when the games start
7431207 the high pressure comes in the year leading up to it
7431208 i am well aware that i will not be winning a medal
7431209 i will be competing against over a hundred of best women from around the world most of whom are professional runners who do not have other jobs let alone work on their doctoral degrees
7431210 we have experienced a declining trend in all the sectors during the period but we are concerned especially for the textile sector as it revamped the whole economy by contributing more than 75 percent in total export earnings
7431211 due to shortages of electricity and natural gas lack of adequate financial resources and political uncertainty the entrepreneurs are shy to invest
7431212 also due to abnormal price hikes the savings of common people are minimal and for that the banks are not in a comfortable position to finance the businessmen
7431213 we had an overtime game on friday and i feel like we started to run out of gas
7431214 but we were able to hang in there and keep them off the scoreboard after the first half
7431215 were still trying to find out roles on the team
7431216 were working on formations and finding out who can help us at what spots
7431217 katie made a great play in overtime to win it for us
7431218 we have a lot of talented attacking players and kelly is a central player to our offense
7431219 along with the freshmen we have six sophomores and a lot of players who havent gotten a lot of playing time in the past
7431220 for a young team we handled this kind of road trip with good composure
7431221 sunday was a great example of when things arent going well we hung in there
7431222 i think our will power allowed us to do that
7431223 we have strength of character that can bend but not break both teams tested us and we didnt break
7431224 we stayed composed under a lot of pressure which was great
7431225 we still have a lot of work to do to be ready for the season
7431226 but we are just going to take it one day at a time
7431227 it is a great opportunity to spend time with the team
7431228 its five days of focus on volleyball and team dynamics
7431229 with such strong middles we have the luxury of moving lori to the right side and getting her a lot more balls
7431230 she adds a whole other dimension to the team she is a huge blocking force
7431231 both girls are working really hard and challenging each other
7431232 we are way ahead of last year and on target to be prepared once the season starts
7431233 its like every day theres a basketball in the clock room that we have to sign so im used to it
7431234 i love the muss i love the excitement of the new season im really excited for football and the new cheerleader uniforms
7431235 that was the best turnout since ive been here thats for sure
7431236 the fans like to interact with the athletes and come see the people they watch at a personal level
7431237 we dont know when we can start this new complex project
7431238 al menos esa es la idea y espero que no haya cambios de ltima hora el a o pasado me lo perd y me apetece mucho volver a ver a mucha gente que conoc en la primera edici n y conocer en persona a muchos e colegas
7431239 the protesters withdrew the blockade after relevant authorities assured them to try to reduce the power outage
7431240 we got a lot of work done on the offensive and defensive side of the football
7431241 you look at a guy like reed who caught a junior college record 111 balls last year thats quite an addition
7431242 chris joppru was the most improved football player in our camp
7431243 also there was jones on the defensive side of the ball
7431244 we are still deliberating whether or not to redshirt shak
7431245 we feel a player is usually always better in his second season with the program but thats not always the case
7431246 but on the other side of the coin so have they
7431247 the idea for the research comes mostly out of the need to understand what the electron spins in semi conductors do
7431248 what researchers have learned is that the spin sometimes slips around by itself
7431249 if you have random spin flips the oscillation of the current goes up and down
7431250 at the moment were working on aspects of the device and making samples
7431251 later were going to do a really systematic study of different parameters and different physical properties that can alter spin flipping like temperature or combining different materials
7431252 this is not as straightforward as people thought in the past
7431253 only one can produce light and the other three produce heat
7431254 if due to a spin flip they can all go into a state that produces light they will produce more energy
7431255 this study is related to the question how much light can you get out of an organic polymer material
7431256 nellultima versione del progetto di legge di revisione del codice penale ha detto il portavoce della giustizia iraniana ali reza jamshidi non sono presenti questo genere di pene
7431257 even though the inflation has badly hit the retail sector we see better sales in the later half of the year

7431261 can you resume your auto insurance policy once it was cancelled
7431262 its always a good day when you go on leave but its always tinged with a bit of knowing that soon youre going to have to come back
7431263 thats the hard part of it you get home you get back into the groove or the swing of things start to feel like a family again and then you get jerked back away
7431264 you have to get right back into the swing of things as people in charge expect you to do your job
7431265 i know ive got to leave again soon and i use that as impetus to ensure that we take advantage of everyday that we have while were together again
7431266 whether im here in iraq or whether im at home no day is guaranteed to me so thats something that i want to apply to my entire life
7431267 its a hollow sick feeling when you have to leave your loved ones
7431268 when you first leave for a deployment theres almost an excitement because you dont know whats going to happen but when you leave to come back from eml you already know what youre going back into and so the excitements gone
7431269 i was heading home right when a helicopter with other soldiers that were going on leave was shot down they were supposed to go home with me
7431270 i wasnt able to get ahold of my wife or family the whole time i was traveling home and they didnt know if i was safe or not they had no idea what had happened until i actually stepped off of the plane
7431271 i go home because i have a wife and a daughter
7431272 i guess were gluttons for punishment because i would probably go on leave no matter what and deal with the second goodbye anyway
7431273 i was almost torn you want to spend time with your family but then you have your unit back in the middle east that you kind of feel a responsibility to
7431274 why should i help work towards this goal when i dont accept the premise that human activity is causing climate change
7431275 our reception of the prisoners tomorrow will be like a national wedding
7431276 when israel frees prisoners to weak elements without demanding anything in return they remain weak
7431277 this is a decision conveying weakness and an acceptance of the existing situation
7431278 which is strange i suppose i can tell you that i felt a bit disappointed when i first heard about knizias great wall of china i designed huang di under the working title great wall in early 2005 i was proud of my initial design because i felt i was the only one to have a great wall of china theme after cambridge games factory cgf picked up the game in early 2007 we actually used the title chang cheng for a while too
7431279 because i felt i had an original idea for a game theme and then all of a sudden everybody seems to use the same theme the same thing happened to me a few years ago when i designed a game about vikings i felt there were no viking games out there so i designed one then of course everybody and his brother releases a viking game right after i designed mine i swear i am cursed somehow
7431280 our floor at work has square patterns on it and on this particular night i began thinking of the various patterns i could make with the squares the next night i found myself doing the same thing and when i got home i began drawing the patterns out on graph paper and somehow felt inspired enough to base a game design around that it is probably the strangest way i have designed a game or got an idea for a game
7431281 its actually my fifth or sixth design i also have designed a couple of games since then that are all still being worked on to some degree
7431282 originally there were ten cards to choose from each round
7431283 after the guys at jklm playtested with people who have never played before they felt that eight cards was just too much for new players to look over and try to grasp almost immediately they consolidated it down to four cards my initial reaction was that it was too few after all you get only three actions each round and now you have only four cards to choose from but actually it plays out much better than i thought it would
7431284 its a bit like games about venice egypt pirates or any of the other themes that have been rehashed and recycled a thousand times before
7431285 people will play the games if the games are good even though they have seen the theme countless times before i can only hope thats the case with huang di as well
7431286 it will be a problematic situation and will keep the textile industry under pressure the current market prices are already above the msp and if it goes up further so will the market rates
7431287 this big a hike is not required the reasonable increase would be between 10 and 15 per cent else in the long run it will have inflationary impacts
7431288 a rise in msp will affect fabric prices as part of a chain reaction
7431289 the industry needs to align itself to the global rates all agri commodities are under priced a 40 per cent hike in msp would be a reasonable increase the industry needs to be competent
7431290 such an msp hike will hit the industry badly with this the government will leave no room for market movement based on supply and demand factors
7431291 this money has never been declared it has never been audited and nobody knows how it is being utilised yet the building belongs to the government this has been going on for close to eight years because the ministry claims that it pays rent to owners of the building yet its a fact that it belongs to the government
7431292 this is not acceptable we cannot continue paying for rent at amber house which is a government building this will be wastage
7431293 we have raised these issues concerning amber house rent but without any success
7431294 as a ministry we dont understand why we should continue paying rent yet we should own this building because as of now its owned by uphl
7431295 these people of amber house ltd have been behaving dubiously by collecting rent through a certain company called bageine and company advocates
7431296 we have instructed the auditor general to carry out a special audit and established the reasons why this company has never remitted any coin to the consolidated fund
7431297 to show you the seriousness of this amber house controversy my committee statutory bodies and state enterprises committee has made a report which we shall submit to parliament for further scrutiny but we are worried that this controversy has been used as a conduit to defraud public money

7431302 following a year long study researchers concluded that a law firm marketing message must penetrate the mind of a prospect a total of nine times before that prospect becomes a customer thats the good news the bad news is that for every three times you expose your prospect to your marketing message it gets missed or ignored two of those times so youve got to put out the good word about your company a total of 27 times in order to make those nine impressions
7431303 when i have a beer thats not quite up to par but still has a nice malt backbone i like to cook with it try a dark to amber ale for beef pork or lamb roasts or ribs i usually do something like pork ribs immersed half way in a roasting pan in the beer season the ribs to your liking and cook the ribs slowly all day so they are almost falling off the bone then get creative with some of the beer in addition to garlic onions ketchup mustard worcestershire white or malt vinegar etc for the bbq sauce finish them on the grill slather with bbq sauce and enjoy with a good beer yum
7431304 then use the vinegar to make mustard relish chutney and marinade
7431305 just hop the heck out of it and call it imperial whatever

7431309 there has been no noticeable decrease in this number primarily because the malling lifestyle has become a way of life for the filipinos
7431310 if you have small kids of course you go to the mall
7431311 you want your kids to be happy because you hardly see them during the work week
7431312 its like they give you everything just so you go
7431313 why mccain is right on russia and right on health care

7431317 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7431318 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7431319 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7431320 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7431321 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7431322 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced

7431330 suggests that battle for the presidency between the illinois senator and republican rival john mccain is all tied up
7431331 we believe that coal use will increase under any foreseeable scenario because it is cheap and abundant
7431332 should and will take actions to reduce the emissions of co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions
7431333 coal will continue to play a large and indispensable role in a greenhouse gas constrained world
7431334 government is like a big baby an alimentary canal with a big appetite at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other
7431335 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7431336 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7431337 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7431338 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7431339 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7431340 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7431341 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope

7431343 hello george this is ron reagan id like to go over to the convention and announce that youre my choice for vice president if thats alright with you
7431344 ive been back every year since i finished up its just great to see all the parents who try to come back and the fans
7431345 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7431346 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7431347 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7431348 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7431349 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7431350 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7431351 im a hillary delegate even so im a democrat first
7431352 i will do exactly what my candidate tells me to do
7431353 her election was really important to me i could feel it from my toes to my head but now i am supporting obama and im going to whatever i can do
7431354 there is no way the democrats are not going to come home
7431355 if we lose this election we ought to quit just quit
7431356 im going to vote and work for him but im not drinking the kool aid
7431357 my concern is that he has a compelling message of hope and change but that hasnt converted to numbers and votes
7431358 he is struggling in national polls i dont think im the only democrat who feels this way
7431359 he is a good person a good democrat i know he has the reputation for sticking his foot in his mouth but i like the fact that he is kind of a straight shooter
7431360 they have to get out of themselves and understand that the presidential election is about the course of history
7431361 i respect hillary clintons candidacy enormously i believe strongly in her
7431362 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7431363 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group

7431366 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7431367 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7431368 i dont know if you are aware that i am a decorated vietnam war veteran

7431371 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7431372 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7431373 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7431374 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7431375 it is going to be a very emotional time for me

7431384 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
7431385 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7431386 i think that when youre play calling on offense you might not necessarily be the best head coach read more
7431387 if the u s dollar is rising commodities take a hit its been a huge factor
7431388 we may see this rally in the u s dollar continue in the short term but you have to differentiate between speculation and the underlying demand for commodities
7431389 the majority of the increase in commodities over the last five years has been driven by demand from china and the emerging economies being so great that supplies havent been able to keep up
7431390 people may have to go a longer distance but it will make it easier and safer for them to turn
7431391 it will be all right turns and you wont have to sit behind cars that are stopped waiting for traffic to clear in both directions
7431392 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7431393 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7431394 i know that we had a tough road ahead of us we knew that these guys werent going to roll over and give up that easily
7431395 so we had to be men and thats what it takes to win
7431396 being a part of the 04 team we really didnt get the opportunity to showcase our talent
7431397 we really wanted to come in and help lead this team

7431406 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7431407 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7431408 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7431409 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7431410 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7431411 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7431412 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7431413 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7431414 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7431415 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7431416 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7431417 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7431418 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7431419 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7431420 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7431421 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7431422 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7431423 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7431424 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7431425 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7431426 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7431427 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7431428 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7431429 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7431430 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7431431 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7431432 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7431433 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7431434 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7431435 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7431436 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7431437 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7431438 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7431439 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7431440 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7431441 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7431442 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7431443 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
7431444 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7431445 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7431446 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7431447 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7431448 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7431449 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7431450 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7431451 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7431452 not to the best of my recollection but there is material being gathered by the department about the child concerned so there may well be something that i dont recall but as youll appreciate it is a long time ago
7431453 i think it would be wrong of me because its very complex human issues that are involved in this
7431454 this is about a child and an adoptive family thats gone out of its way and done their best to give a child a new life and to make a family
7431455 not to the best of my recollection but there is material being gathered by the department about the child concerned so there may well be something that i dont recall but as youll appreciate it is a long time ago
7431456 i think it would be wrong of me because its very complex human issues that are involved in this
7431457 this is about a child and an adoptive family thats gone out of its way and done their best to give a child a new life and to make a family
7431458 equally there are birth parents who have equally suffered so the ultimate outcome here is one that i dont think any of us can know yet
7431459 the strength of the us dollar remains the dominant theme in forex markets said joseph capurso currency strategist at commonwealth bank
7431460 but if domestic data later this week comes in better than market expectations as we are forecasting we could see the aussie edge up
7431461 there are options being looked at but there is no simple overnight solution
7431462 i have to say that this is a very difficult circumstance for this council and i hope that we can resolve it
7431463 the future for the company in the new financial year looks positive
7431464 in the current economic climate of low consumer confidence the companys products tend to become more attractive to consumers and we have noticed this trend in the latter part of fiscal 2008 and the early part of fiscal 2009
7431465 the companys budget for fiscal 2009 indicates a result which will again meet or exceed the expectations
7431466 this was exacerbated by the disruption caused during the commissioning of two new production lines
7431467 the company has undertaken actions to address these issues in the second half of fiscal 2008 and expects to see further improvement in fiscal 2008 ebit margins as a result
7431468 i can now officially say that royal randwick is a racecourse again after temporarily becoming hallowed ground for the recent papal visit
7431469 theres many who consider royal randwick racecourse to be hallowed ground already so i need to be careful
7431470 there were 211 000 square metres of turf protection laid and we had another 10 000 square metres of replacement turf on hand in case the grass was damaged
7431471 but im pleased to say that only 3 000 square metres was required

7431479 people are not knocking on the door looking to invest billions of us dollars in nsw
7431480 certainly electricity is one of the key issues that has to be settled to unblock billions in investment
7431481 thats why theyre beating a path to his mr ofarrells door saying well state a position
7431482 ive heard the business community through the media i understand theyre coming to a meeting with me tomorrow
7431483 i will listen to them as i have listened to others but ultimately as weve said all along were here to determine our position on this matter on whats best for the state
7431484 by my count thats about 20 pages to read and about 30 calls to make but after four days and counting mr ofarrell still hasnt uttered a word
7431485 hes either making no effort at all or simply misleading the public either way hes taking the community for granted
7431486 the greens felt very strongly that this will be a highly significant test of the opposition leaders environmental and economic credibility
7431487 his ability to resist lobbying from his friends in big business will be on trial

7431498 i can now officially say that royal randwick is a racecourse again after temporarily becoming hallowed ground for the recent papal visit
7431499 theres many who consider royal randwick racecourse to be hallowed ground already so i need to be careful
7431500 there were 211 000 square metres of turf protection laid and we had another 10 000 square metres of replacement turf on hand in case the grass was damaged
7431501 but im pleased to say that only 3 000 square metres was required
7431502 the spring carnival is a very important event in sydneys and nsws calendar
7431503 we want it to be successful we now know that it will be with the track in very good condition
7431504 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7431505 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7431506 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7431507 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7431508 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7431509 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7431510 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7431511 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7431512 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7431513 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7431514 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7431515 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7431516 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7431517 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7431518 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7431519 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7431520 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7431521 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7431522 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7431523 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7431524 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7431525 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7431526 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7431527 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7431528 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7431529 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7431530 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7431531 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7431532 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7431533 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7431534 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7431535 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7431536 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7431537 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7431538 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7431539 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7431540 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7431541 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7431542 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7431543 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7431544 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7431545 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7431546 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7431547 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7431548 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7431549 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7431550 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7431551 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7431552 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7431553 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7431554 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7431555 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7431556 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7431557 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7431558 the strength of the us dollar remains the dominant theme in forex markets said joseph capurso currency strategist at commonwealth bank
7431559 but if domestic data later this week comes in better than market expectations as we are forecasting we could see the aussie edge up
7431560 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7431561 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7431562 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7431563 when i graduate i will probably have a job that doesnt exist today
7431564 als je illegaal gaat kamperen in een van god verlaten oord is het moeilijk om hun veiligheid te garanderen

7431575 first the wolf pack finds the weakest easiest target in the herd usually the young aged or injured
7431576 wolves have already been reintroduced to yellowstone the fact that people will eventually die as a result is seen as irrelevant by the groups responsible
7431577 terminating these animals means keeping the numbers of wildlife herds at a level we can hunt and eat for years to come
7431578 and we all know where that money will come from the pockets of hunters trappers and fishermen
7431579 what lost said was 12 01 am we should all run after our meat and rip its throat out with our teeth to kill it
7431580 we should all run after our meat and rip its throat out with our teeth to kill it
7431581 if any of you are capable of killing whatever youre hunting this year in the same manner as a wolf then you might have some real prowess
7431582 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7431583 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7431584 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7431585 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7431586 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7431587 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7431588 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7431589 i voted for the bill before i voted against it

7431870 so many of these listings or upgrades show different faces of the history of the slave trade
7431871 these new listings and upgrades show the close and continuing historical and social links that much of our heritage has to the history of slavery both in this country and from around the world
7431872 we are delighted that english heritage could help in documenting forever some of the extraordinary and moving stories that might not otherwise be recorded in history

7431887 following a year long study researchers concluded that a law firm marketing message must penetrate the mind of a prospect a total of nine times before that prospect becomes a customer that s the good news the bad news is that for every three times you expose your prospect to your marketing message it gets missed or ignored two of those times so youve got to put out the good word about your company a total of 27 times in order to make those nine impressions

7431935 children are particularly vulnerable there are reports of children being killed injured or gone missing due to the fighting
7431936 we also received reports from partners which indicate an increase in the number of unaccompanied children who have been separated from their family relatives and communities some of them are very young children under seven years old
7431937 isolated from their supportive environments these children are most vulnerable to physical and sexual abuse as well as exploitation as cheap or free labour
7431938 lack of access is a major issue that we are facing today although humanitarian interventions are ongoing our ability to respond quickly and effectively with high impact has been undermined significantly due to the deteriorating security conditions

7431949 was concerned with the impact that hunters lobbying activities might have on his expected campaign for the 2008 democratic presidential nomination
7431950 biden told lotito that in light of these concerns his brother had asked him to seek lotitos assistance in finding employment for hunter in a non lobbying capacity
7431951 this lawsuit has nothing to do with joe biden and there is absolutely no truth to those allegations
7431952 it is a business dispute between former partners the suit is baseless
7431953 there was a concern that hunter bidens role as a lobbyist would have an impact on the senators proposed presidential run
7431954 thats what james biden told mr lotito was it true who knows there is no allegation the senator was involved in any of these events
7431955 religion is regarded by the common people as true by the wise as false and by the rulers as useful
7431956 for proof denies faith and without faith i am nothing
7431957 when creationists talk about god creating every individual species as a separate act they always instance hummingbirds or orchids sunflowers and beautiful things but i tend to think instead of a parasitic worm that is boring through the eye of a boy sitting on the bank of a river in west africa a worm thats going to make him blind and i ask them are you telling me that the god you believe in who you also say is an all merciful god who cares for each one of us individually are you saying that god created this worm that can live in no other way than in an innocent childs eyeball because that doesnt seem to me to coincide with a god whos full of mercy
7431958 the truth may be puzzling it may take some work to grapple with it may be counterintuitive it may contradict deeply held prejudices it may not be consonant with what we desperately want to be true but our preferences do not determine whats true
7431959 for me it is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion however satisfying and reassuring
7431960 weve tended in our cosmologies to make things familiar despite all our best efforts weve not been very inventive in the west heaven is placid and fluffy and hell is like the inside of a volcano in many stories both realms are governed by dominance hierarchies headed by gods or devils monotheists talked about the king of kings in every culture we imagined something like our own political system running the universe few found the similarity suspicious
7431961 you cant convince a believer of anything for their belief is not based on evidence its based on a deep seated need to believe
7431962 i cannot imagine a god who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation whose purposes are modeled after our own a god in short who is but a reflection of human frailty
7431963 a mans ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy education and social ties no religious basis is necessary
7431964 a casual stroll through the lunatic asylum shows that faith does not prove anything
7431965 we must respect the other fellows religion but only in the sense and to the extent that we respect his theory that his wife is beautiful and his children are smart
7431966 if i look over my life every single step of maturing for me every single one has had the exact same common denominator and that was accepting what was true over what i wished were true
7431967 the most savage controversies are those about matters as to which there is no good evidence either way persecution is used in theology not in arithmetic
7431968 the whole conception of a god is a conception derived from the ancient oriental despotisms it is a conception quite unworthy of free men we ought to stand up and look the world frankly in the face we ought to make the best we can of the world and if it is not so good as we wish after all it will still be better than what these others have made of it in all these ages
7431969 for those who believe in god most of the big questions are answered
7431970 whenever people are certain they understand our peculiar situation here on this planet it is because they have accepted a religious faith or a secular ideology ideologies are the modern form of faiths and just stopped thinking
7431971 intelligence is the capacity to receive decode and transmit information efficiently stupidity is blockage of this process at any point bigotry ideologies etc block the ability to receive robotic reality tunnels block the ability to decode or integrate new signals censorship blocks transmission
7431972 the materialist fundamentalists are funnier than the christian fundamentalists because they think theyre rational
7431973 we can all see how other peoples bs belief system or bullshit p makes them blind and
7431974 in gordiano brunos day the 3 terms were divided up differently you had science and mysticism on one side and religion on the other side science and mysticism are alike in their struggle against religion they were both based on experience and respect for the individual the idea of science and mysticism was go out and discover for yourself find out what works find out how the universe is actually structured and how you relate to the structure of the universe and so there were basically 2 areas of scientific exploration the external and the internal but they were both pursued by the same method the experimental method
7431975 belief is the death of intelligence as soon as one believes a doctrine of any sort or assumes certitude one stops thinking about that aspect of existence
7431976 all around one the true believers trudge by mouths grim brows furrowed ulcers and worse eating at their innards this desperate company of oddfellows thoreau live in what psychologists call cognitive dissonance because their reality maps are one and all too small to cover the vast eerie amusing world in which we live they are perpetually frustrated the world does not live up to their fixed beliefs they are all convinced that there is something radically wrong with the universe itself or with the rest of humanity and they never suspect that the real trouble is in their own rigid and robotic nervous systems
7431977 what can be asserted witout proof can be dismissed without proof
7431978 not only is there no god but try getting a plumber on weekends
7431979 holds that the existence of the ultimate cause as god and the essential nature of things are unknown and unknowable or that human knowledge is limited to experience
7431980 a few more questions before you verbally berate me how ever you see fit
7431981 do you think that if you prove me wrong then you must be right
7431982 i know that i may be wrong in my beliefs that everything that i have built my entire process of thinking upon may not be right can you not say the same
7431983 what is this momentum leading you to be so forceful in your beliefs
7431984 im a rational free thinker not a closed minded moron p
7431985 my comment on evolution i suspect you did not fully grasp
7431986 whereas if you dont even belief it how can you even try and discredit me
7431987 i hope one day you truly see the light and join us
7431988 i urge you not to even consider using it again
7431989 we all know how many people have died die and shall die in the name of god
7431990 is jesus willing to prevent evil but not able then he is not omnipotent is he able but not willing then he is malevolent is he both able and willing then whence cometh evil is he neither able nor willing then why call him god
7431991 follow the evidence wherever it leads us even if we dont like the outcomes
7431992 whereas if you dont even belief it how can you even try and discredit me
7431993 if evolution were true wouldnt we see animals that are half evolved from a dog into a pig
7431994 if indeed you live by good morals promote love honesty etc then i have no beef with you and i doubt many other people will have

7432004 we should like to take this opportunity to correct the historic omission which to our great regret occurred in 1965 when you were invited to israel
7432005 the concert was canceled because of a dispute between music promoters giora godik and yaakov uri in 1962 godik received an offer from the mother of the beatles manager brian epstein that they come to israel but godik preferred to bring singer cliff richard who was much more famous at the time when uri bought the rights to hold the concert two years later godik was angry that he blew the opportunity and went to the knessets finance committee to persuade them to bar the promoters from taking out foreign currency
7432006 die bewertungsabschl ge der vergangenen woche bilden praktisch schon eine moderate schutzschicht vor den negativen konjunkturindikatoren die kaum noch berraschen

7432014 olympic athletes have to display an unnatural and it has to be said wholly unhealthy level of self discipline in the build up to big competitions how else is this going to manifest itself than with a volcanic release of pent up hedonism
7432015 a common sight to see recently knocked out athletes gorging on magnums and mcdonalds swilling alcohol and of course shagging like crazy

7432022 they converge hundreds of people into these cities and they like to leave something nice behind thats why the conventions are involved
7432023 theres not much democrats and republicans agree on but we all agree on supporting our troops
7432024 thats why the democratic and republican national conventions are proud to join homes for our troops in building specially adapted new homes in denver and minneapolis st paul for a seriously wounded servicemember and their family from each of these communities

7432041 oil is a support as is the weaker yen but the market isnt as strong as you might expect from these two things and doesnt seem to have the strength to rise more
7432042 theres no incentives to buy right now no sense that the markets going to rise from here on in
7432043 if tokyo was really responding to this there should have been a much bigger rise but investors remain wary with so few of the large u s problems really resolved
7432044 we are creating a neighborhood gym that is as comfortable and effective as any other
7432045 at the same time our members are doing their part to help the earth
7432046 yes it isnt a lot of power but it is better than nothing and there is gratification in actually doing something during your workout
7432047 ive noticed in the past year or two that more club owners are becoming more interested in going green
7432048 people in general are paying more attention to being more environmentally friendly
7432049 club owners and their staffs are aware of this and they know their members are too
7432050 it appeals to people who want to walk or bike to the gym and then go home and shower
7432051 its the perfect business for portland and the timing is perfect

7432054 i wanted to let you know i went to dunkin dounuts and i paid for the gals coffee in the car behind me
7432055 i thank the bjp for reviving a movement which was lagging
7432056 ive been scooting around now for about two months its easily removed half of what i normally would use my car for
7432057 what youll save in fuel you can use to make a bike payment
7432058 the savings are a big part of the appeal we certainly dont try to hide that from potential customers
7432059 it comes down to saving a few thousand dollars in gas a year if you make a scooter your primary vehicle
7432060 were running all over the south trying to find bikes to fill it up and our service department is backed up three weeks
7432061 we have customers from all walks of life all ages the difference lately is you see a lot more inexperienced people riding
7432062 the big thing with us is everybodys buying motorcycles to spend less on gas our serious injuries are skyrocketing theyve about doubled
7432063 youre seeing more accidents because theres truly more bikes out there
7432064 the dynamics of harley davidson have changed a little bit
7432065 whereas it was a luxury item now its become a daily ride its not just about the 50th birthday anymore
7432066 most of the accidents are young immature riders on motorcycles that are driving way too fast
7432067 ive only had one encounter with a stupid person on the road
7432068 probably because its a bright orange scooter people dont seem too threatened by it
7432069 culturally if the cost of operating a large vehicle makes it prohibitive to have a large vehicle then most people who are on the fence about scooters start to feel safer about having one
7432070 these carts are becoming a real thing down here people feel safe on the streets with slower speeds
7432071 it may slow the traffic down some but it may also save some lives

7432073 its mostly retired people who are located in or near town driving these things

7432075 you are now doing more harm than good when you leave out addressing zionism leave out reparations for addressing the impacts of colonialism and apartheid from the wcar and when you infuse the ssd with so much private public partnership rhetoric that it puts up the world for sale and does nothing for poverty
7432076 we want to keep our jobs in the coal mines and in the smelters
7432077 comrades couldnt you find an alternative plan with us that gives you more jobs with better pay in the renewables sector for example in getting solar hot water heaters to be constructed en masse

7432088 will create tough new clean water standards that will help protect bristol bay it will not shut down existing mines just protect salmon spawning habitats
7432089 this ballot measure would apply to all new large scale metallic mines disturbing over 640 acres not just the proposed pebble mine
7432090 were just trying to convince alaska that okay we can have mining just not in this place its such an exceptional risk to exceptional fishery
7432091 i have all the confidence in the world that the department of environmental conservation and our department of natural resources have great very stringent regulations and policies already in place were doing to make sure that mines operate only safely soundly
7432092 its going to have to be the most environmentally tight mine ever designed on planet earth if its going to go thats unequivocal
7432093 ballot measure 4 threatens alaskas resource based economy undermines the states stringent proven environmental regulations and may prevent red dog from expanding or even force it to shut down prematurely
7432094 we are competing with the world for exploration funding to the extent it scares companies away that is bad for alaska
7432095 opponents of the measure have outraised supporters by more than two to one
7432096 turning them out to vote is the name of the game youre just sort of banging the drum loud enough that they realize that the last vote is the one that makes the difference
7432097 we needed a talent to fill this spot and had absolutely no ideas
7432098 too ready criminalisation of children and young people for minor offences
7432099 the increased use of pre court summary justice is one of the most important elements in the governments strategy for modernising the criminal justice system
7432100 the implementation of the strategy has received virtually no research inspectoral or parliamentary scrutiny
7432101 not only are serious offenders escaping real justice due to the reliance on spot fines but as this report shows many people who should be dealt with informally are being criminalised he said
7432102 the public are sick and tired of this government pursuing easy targets instead of going after the real criminals this report also shows how labour went into headfirst into this reform without carrying out proper research
7432103 the best way to avoid a criminal record is not to break the law

7432107 i had a go at murray mints and found they worked a treat
7432108 we deserve to have a football team gb at the olympics and i hope it gets sorted
7432109 would i take it if they offered it to me absolutely id be a fool not to the biggest problem id have is who to leave out
7432110 olympic athletes have to display an unnatural and it has to be said wholly unhealthy level of self discipline in the build up to big competitions how else is this going to manifest itself than with a volcanic release of pent up hedonism

7432113 christmas is my busiest season but early fall when georgia is playing at home is also good but it is mostly the first few games after that the fans have most of what they need to finish out the year
7432114 this is where we raised our children so this is home now
7432115 its like a whole new little city up there where ga 44 crosses lake oconee into greene county and a lot of people and businesses have gone there
7432116 i was a housewife most of the time my children were little
7432117 later i had some part time jobs around town that gave me time and flexibility to be home when they needed me
7432118 i enjoyed both of those and decided id like to try my own place
7432119 my husband and i talked it over and he said if this was what i wanted to go for it
7432120 its been a lot of work and a struggle at times but im glad i did it
7432121 we did it without borrowing any money and ive held on so far but im ready for this economy to turn around its been tough this last year

7432160 it is yet another piece of skewed information perpetrated by the anti tanning lobby with the intention of scaring the public away from our services
7432161 the odds have been stacked against us for some time and particularly since the tragic claire oliver melanoma story broke last year on tv1s sunday programme
7432162 were all really struggling so to read the stories that came out last week which seem to indicate there is some sort of burgeoning tanning underworld developing in this country is just ludicrous
7432163 human beings need ultraviolet light for survival and for health the sun scare mentality we are seeing now is dangerous and irresponsible
7432164 especially here in new zealand where we have such a high level of uvb radiation in our sunshine people need to be more aware of how to get the sunlight they need while staying protected absolute avoidance is not the way to go about it and neither in most cases is 24 7 year round spf application
7432165 the fact is that the relationship between uv exposure and melanoma is complex and largely misunderstood prominent dermatologists now say that poorly informed public health agencies along with pharmaceutical heavyweights profiting enormously from the sale of anti sun cosmetics and sun protection products are to blame for perpetuating an unfounded myth about sunbed use and melanoma
7432166 a prejudiced decision that because he was asian because he was chinese he would do the meek and mild thing
7432167 well shawn tan actually knows about standing up for himself and the act party supports every new zealander for their rights
7432168 the idea that you can pick someone off like this and actually pick them off because you think they are chinese and will just go quietly and wont stand up for themselves i tell you that is not the new zealand we support
7432169 there are still new zealanders who make decisions on the basis of superficial things like race and colour and that is something i would have expected the epmu to feel strongly about
7432170 this is the first time i am proud to be american
7432171 its a great result for all the players to find out whether were going or not going
7432172 its a good decision for cricket and we are pleased it was unanimous
7432173 we look forward to dealing with our international colleagues over the details of when the tournament will be postponed to
7432174 by postponing the tournament until october next year there is time for the security situation in pakistan to improve or for a suitable alternative venue to be chosen
7432175 we appreciate the difficulties that this decision will cause the pakistan cricket board and hope that the champions trophy can be held there in 2009
7432176 hopefully ill be playing for a few years to come so hopefully ill get the opportunity to play in pakistan
7432177 come next year whenever they put it back on were looking forward to regaining that trophy but right now all the guys are rapt that the icc has made a decision

7432185 your status could not be changed please try again later
7432186 the present day fuel gauges are electromechanical and are operated by battery voltage which continuously varies causing sluggishness and inaccuracy this can also be a safety hazard as total current drawn from the battery is quite high if there is a short circuit in the float resistance mounted in the petrol tank the new model is solid state and is not affected by battery voltage giving long life and more accuracy and the current drawn is considerably lower
7432187 the fuel gauge can also monitor the condition of the battery when the battery goes below a critical voltage that signal can be used to shut off the load on the battery when the battery voltage goes above the fully charged level this signal can be used to shut off the charging device so that the battery is not overcharged the model uses a single circuit that can monitor the fuel quantity and battery voltage simultaneously it can prevent battery failure due to overcharge or undercharge
7432188 more importantly the price gets reduced by around 35 to 40 per cent mass production can further reduce the cost i feel it will mean a lot to the auto majors considering that more than 10 million automobiles are produced in the country annually i have been working on this concept since last one and a half year starting from the block diagram to the testing and the change in components however my father joginder pal puri is an electronics engineer and he helped me through out from its concept to its completion
7432189 i am primarily trying to get information and gather all the evidence at the scene collect it an then get to the hospital to try and get some victim statements to find out as much as we can about what took place from the time this began to the time it ended

7432194 we train people in what they want be it fun or achievement while the medium is same that is archery
7432195 archery is a lifestyle sport as it needs lot of concentration it also helps in good growth and development in life the idea is not only to win toughest of competition but also to get other benefits of archery
7432196 we aim at olympics 2016 so our mission says go gold for olympics 2016 we are now scouting talent from all over the country for which we are arranging camps and competitions till 2012 we will select them and after that we would train them for olympics 2016 goa is the first centre for the purpose the final camp will be held in pune we have five students from pune who have already proved themselves in various levels of competitions
7432197 mitra has well planned training for the students which we will experiment with new methods and also conduct tournaments and camps
7432198 we feel special children are no exception and they must have access to all arts and skills moreover archery helps in improving their mental as well as physical ability
7432199 we have students with neuro muscular coordination problem and down syndrome but with that extra bit of attention we have seen them perform quite well

7432205 our findings support the idea that bondage and discipline and sadomasochism bdsm is simply a sexual interest or subculture attractive to a minority
7432206 however they were no more likely to have been coerced into sexual activity and were not significantly more likely to be unhappy or anxious
7432207 people with these sexual interests have long been seen by medicine and the law as at best damaged and in need of therapy and at worst dangerous and in need of legal regulation
7432208 and need particularly strong stimuli such as being beaten or tied up to become aroused

7432216 we will have plenty of those weeks during the season so it is not like its not going to come up again
7432217 that is the way it is so we just have to do what we would normally do in seven days in less time when that is the situation that is the way it will be this week
7432218 and its the same thing from a physical standpoint guys could always use an extra day and we have a couple of short weeks here in the preseason with tampa to philadelphia and philadelphia to the giants but we will have a couple of extra days on the other end going into the kansas city game
7432219 in the end it all evens out with every long week there is a short week and with every short week there is a long week there is nothing we can do about it and no point in making a big deal about it
7432220 it was kind of like im on the other side
7432221 it was cool though i still went out there i still tried to make plays thats not ever going to stop
7432222 he just wished me luck and said i played good and glad to see you i told him the same thing i said thanks i appreciate everything you did for me i know hes a busy man we kept it short and sweet
7432223 bill will get them right there aint no reason that i wouldnt believe that he wont
7432224 theyre a good team still they still got old veterans that are just real good theyre going to pull it together
7432225 we just havent really found our groove on the special teams side of the ball
7432226 for myself particularly i felt rusty because it was my first game but we just have to do a better job as a team as a special teams unit going down and making plays like we did last year
7432227 theres just no way we can have returns going back on us putting our defense in a tough situation and putting our team in a tough situation
7432228 we only have another week before we get started but we take a lot of pride in our special teams unit especially our kickoff because the way we cover kicks really sets the tone

7432231 once the missile defense system is put in place it will work automatically with the entire nuclear capability of the united states it will be an integral part of the us nuclear capability and for the first time in history and i want to emphasize this there will be elements of the us nuclear capability on the european continent it simply changes the whole configuration of international security of course we have to respond to that
7432232 us missiles in europe beyond deterrence to first strike threat
7432233 by means of a us first strike about 99 of russian nuclear forces would be taken out
7432234 some people have the illusion that you can do everything just as you want regardless of the interests of other people of course it is for precisely this reason that the international situation gets worse and eventually results in an arms race but we are not the instigators we do not want it why would we want to divert resources to this and we are not jeopardizing our relations with anyone but we must respond name even one step that we have taken or one action of ours designed to worsen the situation there are none we are not interested in that we are interested in maintaining a good atmosphere
7432235 it would be better to look for other ways to fight terrorism than create low yield nuclear weapons that lower the threshold for using these weapons and thereby put humankind on the brink of nuclear catastrophe
7432236 i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security

7432244 sort of like us he obama comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care
7432245 the reception is an opportunity for sen clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for sen obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7432246 in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
7432247 this campaign is not about barack obama and hillary clinton
7432248 his campaign is about george bush and four more years of george bush under john mccain

7432398 by women who actually do work i simply meant women who are doing physical work like caring for a child or working in a garden or working in an outside environment in cases where you are doing more than just hand work it is often impractical to wear a skirt everyday i would never want to care for my one and a half year old god daughter while donning a skirt especially on a windy day

7432434 this was a very good qualifying for the team and me after some unlucky races lately the pace of the car here in valencia is not that bad however there is still a small gap to ferrari and mclaren qualifying went pretty smoothly with only the weather a bit unstable in the end there were only some rain drops in the second qualifying session but this did not affect the result the choice of tyres was pretty clear for me by yesterday i went on the harder compound in q1 and on the softer compound in q2 and in q3
7432435 qualifying eighth is not perfect but i think it was about the maximum possible today as the fuel load comes into play in q1 i thought it was d ja vu when timo glock was in my way our team informs us on the radio how many seconds behind us a fast car is and when we have to let somebody overtake apparently this isn t the case in every team i was afraid my qualifying would be ruined but luckily i was able to do a second lap straight away and it was good enough q2 was fine as i was third fastest and could see the pace was there generally speaking i m a lot happier with my car today on friday i was struggling a lot but we have made a lot of changes since
7432436 on this new and demanding track robert had a great qualifying again and fought his way through to p3 on the grid nick improved in the second part of qualifying and made it into q3 with the third best time overall his last lap wasn t perfect as he lost some time in the second sector anyway eighth is good what these positions are worth we shall see tomorrow during the first pit stops we had no technical problems during qualifying
7432437 this was a very exciting qualifying in the first part there were some rain drops and in the second part the times were close its positive that we were able to get both cars into the top ten qualifying nick drove a very fast lap in q2 and was able to qualify easily for q3 robert also had a very strong performance starting from p3 he is in a very good position for the race and nick will also have his chances im pleased all the hard work we have done since the race in hungary has paid off

7432526 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7432527 theres going to be a lot of rhetoric coming out of the convention but we want to match that with barack obamas record and tell people hes not ready to be president
7432528 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7432529 the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton she had 50 percent of the democratic vote obama has 50 per cent of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7432530 theres a lot of hillary supporters that are concerned that obama doesnt have the experience necessary to be commander in chief and we are going to be very aggressive in reaching out to them

7432536 the question for me is not so much whether st marys should be closed down but whether st marys will close itself down by practices that separate it from communion with the roman catholic church
7432537 nevertheless only extreme recklessness would place a buddhist statue in a christian church
7432538 no matter where that takes place there is every possibility it would arouse angry feelings particularly with christians from different religious cultures
7432539 but its own style of worship and sacramental practice can hardly be described as roman catholic
7432540 as such it is out of communion with the roman catholic archdiocese of brisbane and universal roman catholic church under the leadership of the bishop of rome
7432541 im not particularly hopeful myself but its up to the community they will find the right solution

7432565 the chicago music scene was very exciting its such a big city and it was very welcoming but the portland music scene is great
7432566 theres a lot of people who play a similar kind of music and the label im on hush has a lot of really nice people on it
7432567 that really built my sound i feel like they really added a lot to how the last record sounded
7432568 i was moving for some of the time while i was writing those and i was in a new relationship also so there were a lot of things to write about there was leaving friends and a new love
7432569 my friends and i would do a correspondence sort of like a blog called the getalong one moved to southern illinois and one moved to la and one stayed in chicago and i moved to portland so that song is really about just moving away and keeping in touch

7432629 we are already almost fully committed for tuesday wednesday and thursday
7432630 we have had quite a few political officials making reservations and we just got a reservation for a supreme court justice
7432631 its extremely relaxing you really feel like you were on vacation
7432632 i set out to put together a show that didnt cost that much money and would be awesome
7432633 its just a nice way to spend a sunday afternoon
7432634 this is what the event started out as 12 years ago completely grassroots
7432635 im always a little apprehensive meeting families because you never know they can blame you or embrace you i know i will have to answer some tough questions im literally the last person that saw jon alive
7432636 i was shocked they told me i wouldnt get it
7432637 for me personally i needed to come and meet them and see that they are okay
7432638 i just feel americans should honor the heroes in this country i think they deserve recognition we are very lucky to have them
7432639 im very glad that people came out to show support but at times i wish they didnt have to
7432640 it is only two games if it was the last games of the season maybe there would be pressure but now no
7432641 nobody has said this is crazy this is an idiotic thing
7432642 when i told my family i was going to walk to chicago they said that was a little nuts
7432643 i did it anyway and i kept on doing it
7432644 uh we need perpetual growth because uh well someone just said so
7432645 wir glauben dass die kombination von freier software und freiem wissen nicht nur gewinnbringend ist
7432646 sondern gleichzeitig der n chst logische schritt hin zu einer reiferen organisierteren free culture community die m glichkeit das wissen einer organisation mit anderen aufgaben aber mit sehr hnlichen zielen und prinzipien nutzen zu k nnen ist ein chance
7432647 wir erhoffen uns dadurch einen erfahrungs und wissenszuwachs und w rden uns kooperationen dieser art h ufiger w nschen sowohl in unseren eigenen projekten als auch in der free culture community allgemein
7432648 sie wird als assistentin f r eine bessere und effizientere unterst tzung der kde community sorgen f r 2008 sind bereits acht entwicklertreffen und zahlreiche andere events geplant hier erm glicht eine engagierte gesch ftstellenmitarbeiterin ein noch schnelleres wachstum des k desktop environments
7432649 wir waren damals die erste nationale sektion der wikimedia foundation die eine eigene gesch ftsstelle er ffnet hat damit haben wir als bis dahin rein ehrenamtlich arbeitender verein neuland betreten wir sind froh dass wir diese erfahrungen nun an den kde e v weitergeben k nnen
7432650 abgesehen davon ist uns die notwendige erweiterung unserer gesch ftsstelle durch diese zusammenarbeit sehr viel leichter gefallen denn die beiden gemeinn tzigen vereine k nnen sich auf diese weise viele kosten teilen die sie ansonsten jeder selbst schultern m ssten
7432651 startete hingegen erst vor wenigen wochen und kann auf das umfangreiche archiv der berliner firma directmedia publishing zur ckgreifen die sich seit zehn jahren auf die ver ffentlichung gemeinfreier texte auf cd und dvd spezialisiert hat auf wikisource verf gbar gemacht
7432652 wikisource stellt nicht nur literarische sondern auch wissenschaftliche arbeiten in hoher qualit t zur verf gung wir arbeiten nach dem prinzip klasse statt masse und hoffen im kommenden jahr weitere engagierte mit diesem anspruch gewinnen zu k nnen das digitalisieren transkribieren und korrekturlesen ist zwar durchaus aufw ndig verteilt auf viele teilnehmer und in freundschaftlicher atmosph re macht die arbeit jedoch gro en spa
7432653 wikipedia geh rt mittlerweile zu den zehn am h ufigsten aufgerufenen websites im netz sowohl in deutschland als auch weltweit schon lange geht es nicht mehr nur um die reine sicherstellung des technischen betriebes wir m chten die wikimedia projekte auch weiterhin inhaltlich begleiten durch aufkl rungsarbeit und initiativen zur verbesserung der qualit t
7432654 zwar haben schon mehrere wissenschaftlich hochkar tige institutionen angefragt ob wir diese veranstaltung die der qualit tsverbesserung der wikipedia dient mit ihnen im jahr der mathematik ausrichten k nnen es fehlt aber an finanziellen und organisatorischen ressourcen
7432655 unsere finanzielle situation erlaubt eine fortf hrung dieses wichtigen projektes derzeit leider nicht
7432656 durch unseren verantwortungsbewussten umgang mit den spenden unserer nutzer haben wir in den letzten jahren viel vertrauen erworben ich bin optimistisch dass uns dies nun auch mit immer mehr gro en institutionellen f rderern gelingen wird sei es aus wirtschaft wissenschaft oder dem ffentlichen sektor
7432657 es gab auf jeder seite viel leidenschaft und das ist auch verst ndlich
7432658 aber hoffentlich werden die alternativen deutlich die das amerikanische volk im november haben wird

7432706 have you ever forgotten the page where you found that great article or that perfect gift when using opera the browser remembers not only the titles and addresses but the actual content of the web pages you visit
7432707 our findings support the idea that bondage and discipline and sadomasochism bdsm is simply a sexual interest or subculture attractive to a minority
7432708 however they were no more likely to have been coerced into sexual activity and were not significantly more likely to be unhappy or anxious
7432709 people with these sexual interests have long been seen by medicine and the law as at best damaged and in need of therapy and at worst dangerous and in need of legal regulation

7432735 the markets near term focus is sterling and oil both of which could keep the dollar firm
7432736 there is caution before this weeks housing data and that may keep the dollars gains limited but theres also no reason to actively sell the dollar
7432737 while the commodity markets are still volatile they are no longer going through a one way decline dollar buying momentum seems to be slowing under such conditions
7432738 while the overall tone remains solid the dollars recovery is not smooth as seen in the euro holding firmly above a recent low amid growing optimism about the dollar

7432741 it was just a frustrating night and we have to get back to the basics
7432742 we just didnt have it tonight but you have to tip your hat to fresno
7432743 we just have to take this game and learn from it
7432744 i thought our pitching staff pitched better than the score showed
7432745 we just need to prepare for the next step which is finishing the regular season on a strong note
7432746 este partido dice mucho de nosotros y de lo merecedores que somos de esta medalla se nos escap es una l stima pero estamos muy contentos

7432750 roughly 2 5 billion koruna in farmer subsidies will really be cut and the second half will be found within our ministry
7432751 we have the right to 90 in direct payments 90 of what farmers get in austria germany and france
7432752 we will thus return to the times when we were much less competitive than farmers abroad
7432753 it is impossible to believe that we are able to turn minus 5 billion koruna into zero this is unrealistic
7432754 we will prepare some measures i cannot specify them now but they should not be anything dramatic
7432755 they have given their very best in a fair play environment and achieved amazing results by breaking 38 world records and 85 olympic records
7432756 we are developing those sports were getting better coaching and better facilities that generally attracts the athletes
7432757 i think thats terrific i think theres more ahead too
7432758 its just been a lot of hard work and sacrifices and ups and downs it just really makes it all worth it
7432759 regardless of the start we had we believed we could be gold medalists
7432760 stephanies only starting shes got two or three more olympics in her
7432761 you get the top talent together in one place working training on a daily basis pushing each other thats how you create a great team
7432762 we want her to know how proud we are of her everybodys real excited
7432763 id have to come down just to get on cloud nine
7432764 what a nice tradition to have a hotbed of olympians here
7432765 we welcome all members to the club its open ended
7432766 it would be so exciting to have more athletes to do this
7432767 its just a reward its like all the unexpected hard work paid off
7432768 it was really killing him coming in second all the time
7432769 he might be a bit easier to get along with at the track now
7432770 im not upset with anybody particularly we just did nothing right
7432771 it makes the championship more exciting for sure for helio
7432772 i was really happy early on because i thought my own was going to be the winning strategy
7432773 i was just cruising other people were conserving fuel but i was pushing and pushing i was going for it
7432774 our team orders are always the same dont hit each other if you do climb the fence with him
7432775 it was just a positive attitude not only for myself but for the entire team penske
7432776 after everything that happened this week we never lost faith
7432777 its almost better that he hit it in the water instead of a double because then youve got a stress inning right off the bat
7432778 its not really that big of a deal when that happens its just one of those things that guys want to swing at the first pitch and they kind of know whats going to come
7432779 thats why i wanted to help him so bad to win that game
7432780 the three run homer couldnt have come at a better time
7432781 it was a well played game we got down battled back and we had a big inning thanks to bengie
7432782 i just saw some pitches that were out of location and saw some hard hit balls
7432783 it was a decision made based on how the momentum of that inning was going
7432784 im glad bochy stuck with me there because i really felt stronger toward the end than i have pretty much the whole season
7432785 he gave me the opportunity to prove i could go out there and put some up zeros and give myself a chance to win

7432789 i never want to say that an injury is career ending but its as bad as it can get as far as issues with the knee according to trainer rod martin
7432790 reece is a project he was a receiver two months ago
7432791 i believe this might be his fourth acl maybe in his career
7432792 hes had a lot of tough breaks injury wise so he was on a one year contract so this was very tough for him
7432793 another option is to wait either until a couple of days for these first cuts or even more for the last cuts the last cuts some good people are getting let go on some of the good teams
7432794 we serve sports fans its hard in our culture to fathom tape delaying in the same way they have im not suggesting it wasnt the smart thing for them to do but its not our culture

7432810 la administraci n debe crear las condiciones para el desarrollo del deporte
7432811 espa a no puede vivir de uno o dos entrenadores de uno o dos gimnastas geniales
7432812 hay dinero y se cuida a los deportistas falla la gesti n
7432813 sin equipo est s hu rfano se te acaban las opciones
7432814 se est cuidando mucho a los deportistas y hay instalaciones falla la gesti n
7432815 que los entrenadores trabajen en sus centros y vayan asimilando la alta competici n
7432816 en el 48 vi por vez primera la televisi n en los juegos de londres cuando no la hab a ni en espa a
7432817 nadaba en una charca que era un abrevadero del ganado
7432818 la del campeonato de espa a era la nica piscina en la que hab a nadado
7432819 cuando llegamos a londres todo nos parec a asombroso y est bamos alucinados aunque ramos conscientes que aquellos eran unos juegos especiales y muy austeros
7432820 hab a muchos edificios da ados por las bombas solares vallados y hasta manzanas enteras derribadas
7432821 aunque no cobr bamos un duro en londres nos dieron 20 libras de dietas que a mi me parec an un dineral
7432822 fuimos a los almacenes harrods y me gast todo all en un bote salvavidas y una tienda de campa a que eran excedentes de guerra
7432823 nadaba en una charca que era un abrevadero del ganado con la mala suerte de que tragu agua y me provoc una infecci n en un pulm n que tuve paralizado durante un mes
7432824 nos hicieron una foto para marca pero despu s la pintaron por encima como si llev semos ba ador de cuerpo entero
7432825 cuando fui al campeonato de espa a era la nica piscina en la que hab a nadado
7432826 yo me entrenaba en el mar poniendo bateas cada 33 metros y as calcul bamos unos 100 metros en tres largos
7432827 el problema es que en el mar el agua estaba helada igual a 12 o 14 grados y s lo entren bamos los meses de verano y el resto del a o invern bamos
7432828 muy cerca de donde dio sus primeras brazadas est hoy la piscina del n utico de vigo sociedad a la que perteneci despu s de fusionarse con el mar timo su club de origen all sigue nadando puntualmente varios d as a la semana
7432829 cuando estoy en forma nado hasta 1 500 metros tres o cuatro veces a la semana
7432830 es que mi padre me llev a ver una pel cula de tarz n y me impact johnny weissmuller
7432831 es un fen meno s lo que en el 48 no podr a ganar ocho medallas porque no hab a tantas pruebas
7432832 la principal diferencia entre este partido y el de la fase de grupos ha sido la intensidad
7432833 en ning n momento nos hemos visto perdedores entonces nos falt chispa y confianza
7432834 ahora nos vamos dejando la imagen de lo que somos un equipo nico muy especial y que quiere ganar contra quien sea
7432835 hay que mirar cada partido como una batalla distinta ste dice mucho de lo merecedores que somos de estar aqu pero no puedo decir que una derrota sea el mejor encuentro
7432836 ellos han tenido que dar m s del 100 cerca del 200 porque si no no ganan
7432837 hemos demostrado que somos mejores si el arbitraje hubiera sido con las reglas fiba habr amos ganado se les ha visto un poco m s nerviosos que en otros partidos
7432838 hemos afrontado la final con muy buen esp ritu y de haber tenido un poco m s de suerte habr amos tenido posibilidades de victoria
7432839 ellos han puesto fuerza y velocidad nosotros talento y ganas ha sido un espectacular
7432840 se lo he dicho a mis compa eros no hay mejor despedida posible
7432841 llegar a nuestro asiento en montmel nos cuesta dos horas
7432842 es que pensar que tus opciones para ganar pasan por el safety car
7432843 una vez ha abandonado alonso me daba igual que ganara massa o quien fuera
7432844 me quedan muchos a os en la f rmula 1 para poder ganar aqu y seguro que voy a lograrlo alg n d a ya lo hice en barcelona
7432845 esta temporada no estoy en condiciones de luchar por el t tulo mundial as que prefiero tener mala suerte ahora que m s adelante cuando vuelva a ser competitivo
7432846 en la salida pude remontar una posici n la de nakajima y luego not un empuj n muy fuerte por detr s son las cosas que pasan si sales tan atr s siempre puede haber un incidente y hoy me han embestido a m luego cuando he llegado al box los mec nicos han tratado de reparar la aver a porque quer a terminar la carrera como fuera y en la posici n que fuera
7432847 pero tras analizar bien el coche han detectado que el cambio y la suspensi n tambi n estaban rotos es una pena especialmente por la gente que ha abarrotado el circuito
7432848 me sabe mal por el mec nico he arrancado un poco antes de tiempo ha sido culpa m a
7432849 ser interesante ver c mo se maneja rafa como primero del mundo
7432850 me di cuenta de que en el tenis todo est muy profesionalizado y de que eso es una suerte cuando est s en los juegos sin embargo desarrollas otro tipo de sentimientos ha sido una experiencia muy importante en mi vida
7432851 siempre quiero aprender cosas nuevas en pek n vi otros deportes y a otros deportistas estar en esa situaci n me provoc una sensaci n incre ble cuando iba a comer en el desayuno la comida o la cena estaba con unas 6 000 personas unos 6 000 deportistas de todo el mundo cr anme eso es incre ble
7432852 rafa ha jugado estupendamente as que se merece el puesto completamente
7432853 es el favorito incluso en pista dura porque ha jugado fenomenalmente
7432854 durante cinco a os todo el mundo esper que yo ganara cualquier torneo en el que participara ahora que ha cambiado el r nking rafa sentir lo que yo deb sentir durante mucho tiempo ser interesante ver c mo se desenvuelve con eso aunque hasta ahora lo ha hecho genial ya juega bien en todas las superficies
7432855 cuando quieres ganar la meta y la presi n siguen siendo las mismas que antes
7432856 s lo duro que es llegar a ser n mero uno del mundo y s que seguramente puedo bajar hasta el n mero dos o el tres en los pr ximos meses debo estar preparado para cualquier cosa as que intento disfrutar y aceptarlo todo ahora estoy en mi mejor momento
7432857 tra amos un equipo con un potencial para un cierto n mero de medallas que no se han conseguido
7432858 los m sculos y la cabeza se encuentran en los genes
7432859 hemos tenido dos oportunidades claras de medalla la de marta y la de vasco y nos vamos con 11 finalistas el mayor n mero de la historia
7432860 pero ferm n y marta en referencia al car cter competitivo de cacho el nico oro ol mpico de atletismo en pista y dom nguez se nace no se hace
7432861 hay atletas que no tienen capacidad de competir se nace con ella o no se nace es como las fibras r pidas de los sprinters se tienen o no se tienen no se pueden conseguir en otra parte los m sculos y la cabeza est n en los genes
7432862 s nuestros atletas son veteranos pero muchos aguantar n hasta los europeos de barcelona 2010 no hay que echar a nadie por la edad
7432863 marta por ejemplo si hubiera conseguido medalla se habr a retirado pero ya me ha dicho que no quiere hacerlo sin luchar otra vez en unos juegos as que la veremos en londres 2012

7432892 at the same time we cant talk about the problems weve fixed
7432893 itu foto aku liburan tahun baru kemarin di lombok aku juga nggak sendiri bareng bareng dengan keluarga ada foto kakaknya reno juga dari foto itu aku merasa nggak ada yang salah
7432894 pakai bikini memangnya salah itu kan lagi di pantai sesuai dong dengan tempatnya jadi wajar wajar saja kecuali aku pakai bikini latar belakangnya di monas
7432895 aku nggak perlu klarifikasi apa apa apa yang salah dengan fotoku di pantai itu
7432896 from next year its full effect on cash and revenues will be felt
7432897 its all egypt and fundamentally its an increase in pricing
7432898 the penalty save changed the atmosphere in the ground and put an extra yard in the step of the newcastle players and we were rocking for four or five minutes
7432899 we saw that off and the defending from the corner that got the goal was fine but it was the second phase of that we didnt do well enough we should be either catching michael owen offside or should be picking him up
7432900 he is one of the best strikers in the world he has a gift and it is a gift of being in the right place at the right time he has probably made that run 20 times in the short time he has been on and got his reward
7432901 it was a great header but thats what hes paid to do
7432902 he has that ability to ghost into positions at the last minute
7432903 the ball in has grounded me but he still has a lot to do to score a goal but thats why he played for real madrid and is worth 20million
7432904 everybody will look at the penalty and say the game couldve been different but we had other opportunities as well
7432905 they didnt really create a lot newcastle are expected to entertain at home but we worked hard and kept our shape and did well
7432906 may not be as good as other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choice the american people will face in november
7432907 there are going to be some folks who make a point that they still have pretty strong feelings about the primary
7432908 id love to tell you that ive made the decision but were still in the process
7432909 i am looking for someone who shares my values my principles and my priorities
7432910 the potential of risk associated with the slippery nature of the tub
7432911 there were a few boys inside the lane the crpf men opened fire and killed this elderly man his son too is seriously injured
7432912 our men chased them and somebody threw hot milk over them in a narrow lane they the crpf opened fire
7432913 we had a lot of problems our staff was not able to come to the hospital even ambulances were not allowed to move
7432914 we have approached the district administration and hope things will improve
7432915 the first person that he obama sat down and talked to about this vice presidential issue was senator clinton they had a discussion back in early june and he spent more time with her talking about issues than he has with joe biden or anyone else in the last couple of months
7432916 senator clinton is going to make a great speech on tuesday night were going to come out of this as a unified party because we know the stakes are so great and we have to change the direction of this country
7432917 she is going to be an important voice in this campaign and in moving this country forward in the next administration but he obama felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7432918 pmk is still with upa at the centre due to some difference of opinion it had gone out of the dpa who knows pmk could return to dpa even tomorrow
7432919 we will take a decision on our strategy when the election dates are announced
7432920 i am sorry to say that even karunanidhi has chosen to speak in a language to show that he doesnt want us probably he has made up his mind we also dont want to be part of this alliance
7432921 graduate level it programs and schools that are giving graduates the best deal in terms of salary increases or promotions vs cost of tuition and that are best at gearing their curriculum to the everyday demands of todays it workplace
7432922 are disseminated as widely and effectively as possible to guarantee maximum exploitation and impact in the world of researchers and beyond
7432923 a lot of campuses feel like theyve made really good progress at the campus level of developing plans
7432924 but theres more of a challenge at the regional and state level
7432925 the first video journal to ever be accepted for publication in pubmed
7432926 overall it will increase the interest of the scientists to communicate their findings in video making biological sciences more transparent and efficient
7432927 some people may think this is a harsh decision but one thing i do know is the little things if you forget about them they add up to big things and they cause a lot of problems for your team
7432928 i messed up so its best for the team and im here for them
7432929 this is an opportunity for me to prove myself and showcase my skills and showcase my leadership so thats how im looking at it
7432930 robert marve will be the starter we will not have a controversy if a guy like jacory can go in and have a tremendous game robert marve still will be the starter we have to build depth at that position
7432931 well know more as the week goes on ua coach mike stoops said
7432932 were all a little bit unsure right now hopefully its cured as quickly as possible well see
7432933 he has been one of our more consistent guys out there but its what you do with a football team someone else has to step up and a j has done some good things this camp
7432934 we may change our sets and what we feature may change
7432935 whatever our best 11 are for every given situation we have a lot of flexibility
7432936 unfortunately he is behind robbie right now but he can be a very important player for us a j could probably start for almost any team in the pac 10
7432937 i think the coaching staff has done a good job of preparing me for something like this simmons said
7432938 the campaign for the year is titled the pinnacle as we intend to solidify saleens position as the leader in exclusive performance vehicles
7432939 my vision is to move the brand up with more exclusivity in every model with fewer more substantive offerings
7432940 im used to playing in front of big crowds on big stages basically what i want to do is play hard and be disciplined and execute our game plan i think the teams ready its going to be a great opportunity for us to go out and show what we can do on a big stage
7432941 the pressure is to go out and win thats the pressure
7432942 im going to play within the system and play within the game plan and try to make plays when the opportunities present themselves
7432943 is when you step into something youre not prepared for

7432949 i lost a semifinal of champions league on penalty kicks but today it was my day with the penalties
7432950 we were super in the first half and they reacted in the second half thats normal
7432951 vucinics goal never should have gone in we should have won 2 1 in regulation and everybody could have gone home a lot earlier
7432952 buy professional spray bottles theyll last at least 10 years
7432953 the right size big ones flop around small ones are hard to remove
7432954 you dont want to clean the toilet then end up having to bite the glove ends to get them off
7432955 you can use it to clean the tracks of a sliding glass door scour around the base of faucets and remove baked on matter from toaster racks
7432956 wipe the squeegee after every pass with a microfiber cloth
7432957 store the canister upside down so that the wipes dont dry out
7432958 a label that says its chlorine free and wont scratch
7432959 its high acidic level removes mineral deposits from faucets and windows and kills bacteria
7432960 you can pour it in the toilet or wipe down faucets counters floors and more
7432961 if you have a pan with burned on grease put it on the stove with water and baking soda and boil the water
7432962 it has that magnetic attraction picking up dust and pet hair anywhere it lands

7432964 two rivals who waged a protracted and sometimes antagonistic battle for the partys presidential nomination
7432965 placement on the obama ticket could renew scrutiny of the clintons financial dealings including the undisclosed donors who have contributed to the clinton presidential library

7432968 a politician who could reinforce obamas message of change but who also shares the drawback of inexperience
7432969 the biggest concern the irs has is getting these people to claim the money theyre entitled to
7432970 if theyre eligible for benefits we want them to get them
7432971 for people who dont have to file a tax return its just kind of an odd situation in many cases they may not have filed a federal income tax return in several years
7432972 its a very simple form to fill out and its not nearly as complicated as a regular tax return
7432973 its a very streamlined form and it probably takes about 10 minutes to fill out and then it just needs to be sent in
7432974 and i think the irs has been surprised at how much money is left unclaimed but when you have a group of seniors not filing tax returns thats logical to me social security isnt taxed and all those social security recipients might not even know theyre eligible
7432975 it takes no time at all for us to help them complete their returns theyre very simple its 15 minutes in and out
7432976 if they dont have that 1099 but they have a record of what they received for any particular month last year we can do a workaround
7432977 im hopeful that people who are eligible will apply and get their checks i just feel very happy to be able to do this for these folks
7432978 financial entities like banks broker dealers regional banks finance companies and insurance companies need credit at reasonable rates in order to finance themselves
7432979 for many regional banks like keycorp zions regions and national city the door has already shut on them if they wanted to raise capital in the debt market at levels where their outstanding issues regularly trade they would have to pay 12 15 hardly economic levels
7432980 then there are the good banks like j p morgan and wells fargo j p morgan recently sold 600 million of preferred stock at 8 3 4 and wells fargo sold 1 3 billion at 8 5 8 plus underwriting fees
7432981 below i offer up a few guesses of what other issuers would have to pay to issue preferred stock lehman brothers 11 13 merrill lynch 11 12 morgan stanley 9 10 citigroup 9 1 2 10 1 2 cit group 12 15 fannie mae freddie mac 15 keycorp 11 13 national city 13 15 wachovia 10 12 zions bancorp 13 15 gm gmac not possible washington mutual not possible ford not possible
7432982 rf regions financial needs to raise 2 billion says sanford bernstein lets see what are their options they can sell debt the problem here is that you couldnt sell debt if you wanted the last reported trade in rf paper was 2 weeks ago nearly 700 to the 30 year or close to 12 their preferreds trade at 10 and the stock is now a single digit midget near 8 a share so if you could even get a deal done shareholders would get a 50 haircut

7432988 we are witnessing an overblown crisis of confidence and the effects of a global credit squeeze rather than a debt constrained slowdown
7432989 national income growth remains strong underpinned by the profits of the mining boom
7432990 markets are not generally oversupplied and in the case of residential property there is considerable pent up demand which we expect to be released from 2009 10 as credit conditions start to ease
7432991 the external sector is also poised for a recovery underpinned by sustained high demand for commodities and a significant depreciation in the australian dollar over 2009 and 2010 which will boost competitiveness
7432992 total business investment activity is also expected to remain at high levels on account of sustained high demand for commodities and the backlog of work required to update the infrastructure network
7432993 the playing field has changed both at home and abroad and inflation is now intransigent
7432994 more recently we have seen the emergence of supply constraints in housing energy and child care
7432995 these supply constraints will ease once investment responds to strong price rises and in the case of housing after credit conditions ease
7432996 a low unemployment rate means that it wouldnt take much of a pick up in investment and employment for the economy to again exceed its speed limit and re ignite inflationary pressures
7432997 and the result is that we are likely to see shortened or flattened investment cycles accompanied by rising inflation and escalating interest rates
7432998 we are at the top of the current interest rate tightening cycle but it is only a localised peak

7433022 today i have pending one adverse or disciplinary action i have one proposed adverse action there are four ongoing investigations and one resignation that had resulted from one of the investigations that ive conducted
7433023 we have not denied registration with students below 16 because thats by law were obligated
7433024 registration has been going on for the entire summer and weve posted notices on the door saying that registration will be going on until july 31 we have to stabilize some time this is the result of continuing and continuing to register students we cannot bring any students here
7433025 the classes are too large we have classes where teachers arent accepting students anymore because they are beyond 30 i sympathize with them and its my responsibility as a principal to make sure those things are not happening
7433026 i instructed my assistant principal for curriculum to watch closely the registration and who are those students that are coming to register and if theyre not under 16 which is the age to tell them to come back and wait for us to stabilize our numbers after the drop out period hopefully our numbers will come down and well be able to accept other students
7433027 they can attend jfk because jfk right now has 1 800 students and sshs has 2 000 i have over 2700
7433028 what it is in fairness to the integrity of the inspection process we didnt ask them for a schedule so its basically they tell us we want to go here and we want to go there theres basically no preparation if you will to shortcut it
7433029 the main reason why this is happening is to free up additional bandwidth for cellular and additional public services its also to improve the quality of pictures and programming that people are getting on their tvs
7433030 when we have a storm cable will probably go out in a lot of locations i would really recommend that everybody get the coupons not just the people without cable
7433031 the first event today was an all delegate celebration and it was katrina relief organizations that got together and threw this party for all the delegates coming you can feel the energy everywhere you go everyones in a festive spirit everybodys wearing their obama paraphenelia and their clinton paraphanelia everybodys exited and theres a lot of things going on everywhere you go its political territory here
7433032 wednesday is roll call we dont know exactly how its gonna take place theres some talk about how roll calls take place theres also some talk about hillary clinton releasing her delegates to allow them to vote for barack instead of having an un united roll call so hillary may release her delegates to barack so its real interesting we dont know whats gonna happen but for the sake of unity we hope that thats what happens so that our party will go into this upcoming general election united
7433033 ive seen you do that before i just didnt think youd do it at that point in the game
7433034 if you bring it in we will issue an entry form and again this is an incentive to use the bag and in 5 weeks september 26 we will have a drawing for prizes
7433035 right now were in our last box and now were ordering more so its really going great
7433036 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7433037 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7433038 obviously it helps because his marcus name is out there so when they see my name they think i must be good too
7433039 im kind of laid back but i think i might get a little more excited than them at times
7433040 i might do a little more talking than them i might be a little more aggressive
7433041 they like how i make the big plays and how i can turn a game around for my team
7433042 they like my technique my footwork my hips and my jumping ability and those type of things
7433043 i wouldnt mind playing offense but i really want to be a corner
7433044 if it happens that i find a school in the middle of the season ill make a decision then
7433045 it plays a part but location isnt a problem to me
7433046 i want to make my own statement but im not saying i wouldnt go to that school or any school in washington i just want to try and find the best place for me
7433047 i need to really vibe with the position coach and see what type of guy he is
7433048 and i need to meet some of the players and see what they have to say about the school they are living it so they can tell me how it is thats it really
7433049 what can we do to make your next visit even better
7433050 it would be nice if there werent so many phone interruptions
7433051 obviously that is a lot slower than what you had in 2007
7433052 the reason being is global economic slowdown higher commodity prices and tightening of monetary policy on the part of the central bank
7433053 private consumption will remain in the drivers seat supported by robust remittances
7433054 domestic demand will emerge as the saviour of growth as external demand suffers due to global slowdown prospects and elevated commodity prices
7433055 it might work to my advantage that so many players are out of the team
7433056 an opportunity for senator clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7433057 the persistently gloomy outlook for the us economy and oil demand and spread of the economic downturn from the us to europe is weighing on prices
7433058 also as the us dollar gains strength the oil pricing comes down so the movement in the us dollar is also driving oil in the short term
7433059 according to our latest information 87 perished and 12 were hospitalised in the trauma unit including two who are in very serious condition
7433060 the 376th air expeditionary wing provided two large fire trucks an ambulance and nearly two dozen medical and fire and crash support personnel to the scene of the accident
7433061 medical personnel have also been requested to provide support at airport terminal which is adjacent to the base
7433062 it seemed that only people of asian background were responsible for this type of crime but as i delved into it i discovered that it was a global problem its not just hindus sikhs or muslims
7433063 you may fool all the people some of the time you can even fool some of the people all the time but you cannot fool all of the people all the time
7433064 stop the hostilities and resolve issues on the negotiating table
7433065 abide by their obligations to uphold human rights and protect the lives of civilians at all times
7433066 a dirty ploy to utilize the conflict muddle the issue and increase the risks against the already endangered lives of our workers who are diligently doing their work as human rights defenders
7433067 attacks on civilians especially children is a deplorable act that will not earn the sympathy of anyone but only condemnation
7433068 have likewise caused violations such as forced evacuation and destruction of properties
7433069 with the escalating number of evacuees the two sides must stop the hostilities and return to the negotiating table to resolve the thorny issues the evacuees well being must be considered
7433070 accordingly it will not be necessary for you to appear in court on this matter and we have so advised the court
7433071 i think we accept that it is unlikely you will see a games on this size and scale and stature again
7433072 the ioc in 2001 reached the conclusions that the focus must be much more on sustainability that big is not necessarily better
7433073 we have been dazzled we have been impressed we have been blown away by these beijing games but we have not been intimidated and in our own sweet way without wasting tax payers money i am convinced that we can do just as well in 2012
7433074 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue
7433075 this could give you an almost infinite number of switches and options for communication

7433078 the federation council is ready to recognise abkhazias and south ossetias independence if the people of these regions wish and if there is an appropriate decision by the russian president
7433079 this stops immediate plans to dig up approximately 400 000 metric tons of rock for resource testing from this world famous landscape
7433080 publicly we hear ministers proclaiming support for the states most successful industry sector but in reality short term politics still win out over a long term vision for the resources sector
7433081 global exploration managers already rank queensland as the least attractive jurisdiction in
7433082 the company remains convinced that developing the states strategically important oil shale resources is in the best long term interest of both queensland and

7433094 their former comrades who continued loyal to unaltered pharisaism nevertheless the pharisee and the christian remained sufficiently close to regard one another with respect
7433095 rabbi eliezer ben hyrcanus one of the most orthodox of the sages offered high praise to an interpretation of scripture given by an early christian
7433096 during the first century of christianity the rabbis lived on friendly terms with the minim

7433098 illegitimate birth the seducer was a soldier by the name of panthera also called pandira and stada
7433099 pappus husband of mary has nothing to do with the story of jesus and was only connected with it because his wife happened to be called
7433100 editions contain a similar story of a dispute which jesus carried on with the scribes who on the ground of that dispute declared him to be a bastard
7433101 hence the pseudonym balaam given to jesus in sanhedrin 106b and gittin 57a
7433102 he is pictured as blind of one eye and lame in one foot and his disciples distinguished by three morally corrupt qualities
7433103 this hostility against his memory finds its climax in the dictum that whenever one discovers a feature of wickedness or disgrace in his life one should preach about it
7433104 she who played the harlot with carpenters they subjected him to four deaths stoning burning decapitation and strangulation he was thirty three or thirty four years old
7433105 i have seen balaams chronicle in which it stated balaam the lame was thirty years old when phinehas the robber killed him
7433106 balaam is frequently used in the talmud as a type for jesus
7433107 and all the balaam passages are anti christian in tendency balaam being used as an alias for jesus phinehas the robber is thus taken to represent pontius pilate and the chronicle of balaam probably to denote a gospel
7433108 in the case of the wicked balaam whatever you find written about him lecture upon it to his disadvantage
7433109 in the process of killing balaam num xxxi 8 all four legal methods of execution stoning burning decapitating and strangling were employed
7433110 he met his death at the age of thirty three ibid and it is stated that he had no portion in the world to come
7433111 it was to oppose these that the doctrine was emphatically asserted in the second of the eighteen benedictions
7433112 in order to obviate hostile misconstructions the text was modified
7433113 furnished the traducers of judaism and the jews a ready weapon of attack
7433114 the seventh benediction looks like a duplication and is superfluous
7433115 blessed be thou who hast not made me a goy
7433116 whoever mocks the words of the sages is punished with boiling hot excrement
7433117 when judas found he could not touch jesus in any way in aerial battle he defiled him
7433118 lowered into dung up to his armpits then a hard cloth was placed within a soft one wound round his neck and the two loose ends pulled in opposite directions forcing him to open his mouth
7433119 the death penalty of burning was executed by pouring molten lead through the condemned mans mouth into his body burning his internal organs exhibit 152
7433120 he was lowered into dung up to his armpits then a hard cloth was placed within a soft one wound round his neck and the two ends pulled in opposite directions until he was dead
7433121 woe unto him who maketh himself alive by the name of god
7433122 it was by the action of the priests that jesus was sent before pontius pilate
7433123 had most reason to be offended with jesus action in cleansing the temple

7433128 hi guys i have been working my tail off applying the stuff that i learned from your seminar
7433129 you have no idea how much i have learned and continue to learn from both of you and how my life has changed since i met you
7433130 gary you are right the internet is the great equalizer see what i have published my best to you as always michelle
7433131 my head is still spinning from all of the valuable input i received out in the boonies three hours from the airport in charlotte north carolina it was not your typical setting for a business seminar
7433132 it was presented by a fascinating guy with an interesting career history gary scott and his wife merri split their time between their idyllic farm in north carolina and their property in the mountains of ecuador i first heard about gary through my interest in ecuador
7433133 by his own admission gary is often a bit ahead of the curve which is part of what makes his material interesting you sense the authenticity of what he is saying but it has not caught on in the mainstream media or pop culture
7433134 the input is that is already affecting my life was not just from the instructor but from other participants
7433135 the lifestyle aspect of the course was taught by example we as a group were temporarily inserted directly into the lifestyle led by gary and merri no better way to learn than by doing
7433136 the course content suited my needs very nicely it addressed issues pertinent to filmtrips and my marketing company mj media youracm com new life has been injected into several filmtrips projects that had been languishing on a back burner for quite some time gary talks about being open to connect the dots and take advantage of distortions or discrepancies between economies and countries i am in a very good position to do that telephone and internet technology has certainly arrived to help make it happen i will keep you posted

7433157 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7433158 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7433159 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7433160 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7433161 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7433162 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7433163 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7433164 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7433165 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7433166 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7433167 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural

7433172 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7433173 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7433174 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
7433175 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

7433179 at the same time we cant talk about the problems weve fixed
7433180 one day kevin invited a bunch of guys over for a poker game and he said hey my little sister wants to play do you mind and they all thought what a cute kid sure and so i played and cleaned up
7433181 it was the first time i realized that being a girl in a guys game has an advantage men underestimate me
7433182 for example men arent as good at multi tasking and so when i sit down at a table i always start chatting it throws them off their game
7433183 i knew i had to take this chance to spend a few days of my freed up time in vegas and so i called some girlfriends and we all decided to go
7433184 some men dont like playing against women i had one guy after a female had folded say see this is why women shouldnt play they ruin the game its even worse if they lose to them
7433185 i have a physical thing when im excited i turn red id have to wear a veil if i played poker professionally
7433186 i guess you can call this the luck of the irish
7433187 they have incredible intuition i can never get away with a lie to my wife or my daughters and if a woman is playing poker and she dresses correctly she can be so distracting some lean and stretch in certain ways or maybe im just a letch
7433188 i immediately put myself on guard when she sat down i couldnt tell if she could play well and i waited to see i think shes a good player luck of the irish hey im irish too
7433189 the minute a woman sits down at the table men are automatically uncomfortable
7433190 i know the guys are intimidated by me and so they dont play their usual game
7433191 doing well in this tournament is assisting in creating buzz for me in hollywood one day i hope to invest the money i make in poker in creating and producing to get films and stories out there that i want to do i tell women if you enjoy poker do it somebody has to win so why not you
7433192 i wanted to prove to myself that i am good enough i didnt lose money which means i am

7433205 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7433206 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7433207 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7433208 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

7433211 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7433212 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7433213 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7433214 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7433215 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7433216 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7433225 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7433226 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7433227 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7433228 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7433229 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7433230 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7433231 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras

7433248 on behalf of the sharks and after consultation with our chairman barry pierce members of the board and coaching staff considering the allegations being made concerning an incident said to involve greg bird we will be standing greg down for an indefinite period of time
7433249 so as to not pre empt the legal process i wont be discussing any details of the incident nor matters which now have been referred to a court hearing
7433250 also the club does not want to pre judge greg until we have had an opportunity to meet with him his management company and his legal counsel face to face however we are mindful that the allegations made by police prosecution at this point in time are extremely serious
7433251 at this stage the best solution for all parties is that the legal process is allowed to unfold with greg off the field
7433252 die bewertungsabschl ge der vergangenen woche bilden praktisch schon eine moderate schutzschicht vor den negativen konjunkturindikatoren die kaum noch berraschen
7433253 wenn die ausschl ge sich allerdings im rahmen halten und keine allzu gro en ausrei er dabei sind sollten die wirkungen auf den aktienmarkt begrenzt bleiben
7433254 w hrend die europ ischen staaten erst am beginn der konjunkturschw che stehen k nnten sich in den usa in den n chsten monaten anzeichen einer erholung zeigen deshalb wird das interesse der marktteilnehmer f r die fr hindikatoren der wirtschaftlichen entwicklung in den usa noch zunehmen zudem sollte sp testens nach der wahl eines neuen us pr sidenten im november eine leichte hoffnungsrallye einsetzen bis dahin werden die m rkte aber noch sehr schwankungsanf llig bleiben

7433257 typically if we have a poor crop one year we have more flowering and stronger flowering for the next years crop
7433258 you never know when mother nature will throw a hardball at you but right now it looks good
7433259 we tend to site orchards on well drained ground so hopefully the water ran off most of the sites where the orchards are
7433260 a lot of insects that were hatching out actually drowned so the birds that normally eat insects are really taking great satisfaction in our apples
7433261 we have more apples than last year but we have an awful lot of seconds so well have to use those in cider
7433262 thats part of the issue of the vulnerability of growing things
7433263 were pretty much controlled by mother nature some things you just cant do anything about
7433264 in der k nstlergarderobe traf ich ihn zum ersten mal und ich zitterte er sagte oh du studierst bei fritz reiner sehr interessant pl tzlich sagte er nat rlich nehme ich dich in meine dirigierklasse auf ich musste noch nicht einmal vorspielen es funktionierte nur auf der basis von empfehlungsschreiben und pers nlichem gespr ch und weil wir uns vom ersten moment an sehr mochten er wurde mein vater und wir liebten uns bis zu seinem tode er starb in meinen armen
7433265 manche meinen mahler habe besser dirigiert als komponiert ein dirigent habe zu sehr die musik anderer im kopf als dass er etwas eigenst ndiges schreiben k nne ich bin da ganz anderer meinung mahlers musik ist fantastisch und durchaus eigenst ndig nat rlich ist es nicht leicht gleichzeitig dirigent und komponist zu sein ich sollte es wissen denn ich habe das gleiche problem und das ist einer der gr nde daf r warum ich mahler mag es ist so als seien zwei menschen in einem einzigen k rper gefangen der eine ist dirigent und der andere komponist und beide sind eine person namens mahler oder bernstein man f hlt sich wie ein doppelmensch
7433266 guten morgen servus gr gott also wir haben schon einen wunderbaren falstaff zusammen gemacht jetzt kommt etwas anderes ich habe eine entschuldigung zu machen dass wir mozart spielen das ist ihre musik ich glaube es ist auch meine musik aber es ist viel mehr ihre musik ich hoffe dass ich etwas lernen kann von ihnen die stimmung wienerische stimmung und phrasierung wenn sie etwas haben mir zu sagen bitte machen sie das ja wenn ich etwas nicht traditionell mache bitte sagen sie mir das auch
7433267 its not the finish i had imagined but i am slowly coming to terms with whats happened over the last 24 hours
7433268 the realisation that i had just played my last game for the knights was very overwhelming and the thought of not putting on my red and blue no 9 jersey ever again was really hard to comprehend
7433269 i was looking forward to a huge game against the storm this week in one of my favourite games of the year in front of the old boys and our loyal fans one last time
7433270 i know the boys will be doing everything they can to give newcastle a shot at the finals and are up to the challenge against last years premiers
7433271 with the world cup at the end of the year i felt my goal of playing for australia one last time was within reach as well but it just wasnt meant to be
7433272 i have had a great run in the representative arena over the years and im proud of what i have achieved
7433273 the memories i take with me and the friendships i have formed will last a life time
7433274 not many great players get to go out on their terms and i really feel for danny he deserves so much better
7433275 danny has been the ultimate club man and achieved everything the game has to offer to see his career end in the confines of a doctors room is cruel
7433276 the contribution danny has made to rugby league and the city of newcastle is enormous
7433277 i remember him coming to the club as a skinny little half from taree to watch not only what he has achieved but more so the way he went about it is a credit to a rugby league icon
7433278 he leaves a lasting legacy and will be remembered as one of the all time greats of the game
7433279 only a place like newcastle could give you the welcome home we got that night
7433280 winning the premiership and then the trip back up the f3 was the highest of highs and walking into the packed stadium was incredible something i will never forget
7433281 the feeling i got that night stayed with me and motivated me for all these years to train week in week out to reach that pinnacle again
7433282 together we see ourselves as inheritors of the legacy he left behind generations that have readily picked up the spear which he dropped from his hand when the time came for him to take his leave of the world of the living
7433283 he was a great man he had a sense of humour he showed affection and love when he was released from prison
7433284 during the lecture i thought of my husband he used to tell me about everything that was happening in the struggle
7433285 it takes three hours to apply the make up and effects for the cannibals
7433286 the head pieces have to be glued on and then clay is daubed onto the top of the head
7433287 it takes a further one to two hours to remove everything at the end of the days shoot
7433288 the crags and surrounding areas were chosen as a location for the filming of crusoe because of the large expanse of indigenous forest and the rugged desolate coastline
7433289 it is time for management to look at the security measures in that building
7433290 said one presenter who did not want to be named for fear of victimisation
7433291 the funny thing is they didnt use any force to get into the studio which was locked
7433292 we had cameras and an alarm system but we do not know what happened to them
7433293 saying no to crime drugs prostitution child abuse and human trafficking
7433294 reduce crime within the correctional services centre and within the community
7433295 i was thrilled to be part of the event because it was uplifting to see guys who are in prison for crime turning their lives around and giving back to the community
7433296 call out against crime offers storytelling creative writing poetry and craftwork to other inmates
7433297 since they made their own banners for the launch in july we asked if they could help us with making these banners they said theyd like to join us by making the banners for us and send the message on crime
7433298 we believe that the german investigation ceased because of a lack of co operation from south africa and we suspect that the british investigation may likewise also be ended due to a singular lack of assistance from the government
7433299 if this is untrue we challenge the minister of justice to refute this by providing the public with substantive evidence that south africa is co operating fully with the british authorities
7433300 by accessing the mlas we would be able to hold the government to account in terms of whether it assisted the german and british investigations
7433301 it is essential that our government co operates fully with the investigations and ensures that any south africans who benefited unlawfully from the billions of rand spent on the arms deal are publicly held to account
7433302 disclosure of the copy of the request as well as other documents which accompanied the said request will in my view prejudice the good international relationship between south africa and britain
7433303 the previous strategy was not dealing adequately with this problem and we want to proactively combat theft and make a difference
7433304 seventy per cent of copper and aluminium is exported to china and india and it is unclear how much of it is stolen
7433305 i dont have time to deal with stolen or illegal goods
7433306 however there are people who bring in stolen goods and i try to get as much information like their id numbers and car registration numbers
7433307 one of the robbers an 18 year old youth was fatally wounded and died on the scene a 22 year old woman was wounded in the upper thigh and a 20 year old man was shot in the ankle
7433308 i dont know who started shooting who i was sleeping with my two children when i suddenly heard gun shots
7433309 i was scared to go outside and see what was happening when the police van and the ambulance arrived i saw one body lying on the ground and the two girls who often came to visit our neighbour were shot one in the ankle and the other in the thigh
7433310 we are still shocked and confused about what happened here this morning
7433311 i spoke to former save a pet worker jane griffiths who now lives in london and asked her if waterproof boots for the dog were available there
7433312 she was taken to a vet and had an operation done to remove the nail but a week later her other toenails started falling off
7433313 i left a copy of one of my promotional singles with one of the local djs when we were performing at tshisa nyama in motherwell two months ago the next thing i heard my song being played in shopping malls on radio stations in taxis and at other big events around the province
7433314 piracy is robbing south africas film and music industry of millions while local actors and musicians are being crippled financially
7433315 as i was writing down the number the policeman came around the counter and sprayed pepper spray into my face he then started beating me and kicking me
7433316 you are all ganging up to lie and protect sithole a policeman
7433317 the citizen of the year event is among a number of very important annual promotions by the herald that create and sustain critical linkages with the communities that we serve
7433318 this particular event is an opportunity for the newspapers readers to highlight the achievements of our unsung heroes and heroines by nominating those in various sectors of our community who go out of their way to make a positive difference in other peoples lives or make these differences through personal achievement in those sectors in which they are active thereby providing meaningful examples of outstanding citizenship for us to emulate
7433319 each awards presentation is an exciting moment which we look forward to every year with great anticipation and this year will be just as great
7433320 general motors is once again proud to partner the herald in recognising the regions most outstanding citizens
7433321 they are the real heroes the ones who are prepared to roll up their sleeves and focus on solutions instead of problems
7433322 the nsri immediately put out a general inquiry to our coast watchers maritime authorities and marine experts
7433323 we investigated the possibility of a spring tide brought on by the full moon a few days earlier and any astronomical activity that might have caused this effect
7433324 the vet on duty suggested i bring him in and he would try and make him throw up i took him in and the vet tried to put drops in his eyes to make him vomit but that proved impossible because he tried to bite the vet who quickly retreated to the other side of the room
7433325 nick dislikes men so i muzzled him and the vets receptionist and i kept him in the car park nick is also frightened of walking on floor tiles so we didnt want to take him inside
7433326 the vet came out to the car park and tried to inject him but nick went ballistic absolutely mental
7433327 kita sama sama tahu bahwa olimpiade beijing adalah terbesar dan terbaik sepanjang sejarah olimpiade saya sempat berbincang dengan wakil presiden cina xi jin ping dia mengatakan bahwa 100 tahun mereka memimpikan olimpiade ini lalu dia tanya balik ke saya kapan indonesia laksanakan olimpiade
7433328 pendapatan perkapita cina itu us 2600 sementara kita pendapatan perkapitanya us 2700 tetapi mereka punya kelebihan dalam hal hal tertentu
7433329 to tell you the truth i had no idea how it is supposed to be spelled
7433330 we took the bacon down to one day a week
7433331 its just something everyone loves you walk in schools and smell that bacon frying and the kids go crazy
7433332 today most of us rely on our blackberry devices as much if not more than we rely on our laptops
7433333 as such blackberry is a fantastic platform for the mobile delivery of our professional development courses our partnership with chalk on this initiative is leading edge and one of a kind
7433334 mindleaders has always prided itself as first to market where emerging delivery technology is concerned
7433335 back in the 1990s we were first movers to the internet we made a huge commitment to that new space and our customers were the winners now thanks to our partnering with chalk leaders and managers who thrive in a fast paced mobile environment are about to win yet again keep looking for more great things from us
7433336 this initial offering from the chalk mindleaders partnership tackles the most pressing issues in corporate america today and will help companies engage and develop their leaders and managers while fostering productivity
7433337 we are perturbed at the lack of interest by city management in cleaning up vacant buildings
7433338 in a given year the biology unit at the crfss can receive about 42000 cases for dna testing
7433339 of these about 25000 samples get classified as negative and therefore are not analysed
7433340 staff shortages and staff retention at the laboratories are a challenge for management
7433341 this would occur if for example false rape or assault claims are made and cases are subsequently withdrawn from the court roll but the laboratories are not informed of the withdrawal and proceed to test the samples at great cost

7433553 once they flood the ditches the rattlesnakes are all over killed two in my driveway yesterday
7433554 and we had a mountain lion here in march big fellow
7433555 that doesnt mean that he doesnt make mistakes he does and we try to correct them and just hope that you keep learning from them pretty soon it will all come natural but im pleased with his progress
7433556 regardless when ben was here and before he had gotten hurt you got to approach it like youre going to play because you never know
7433557 you got to approach every game like you are the no 1 guy if you dont then you wont be ready when you get your chance
7433558 its important for your offense to know who the starting quarterback is because thats your leader thats the guy that everyone has to follow and trust
7433559 we have a guy that we can just grow along with weve been working with him since spring summer since ben olsons been out so we have a lot of chemistry with him it shouldnt be a problem at all
7433560 i have a good foundation just growing up around football with my dad being a coach
7433561 especially at the quarterback position because hes an offensive guy framed the position for me since i was young
7433562 anything can happen any play in football we already saw that kevin could have gotten hurt today you just never know i just have to be ready when my opportunity comes and when it comes im just going to go out there and do my best
7433563 when we need to change it and if were not doing so well and the defense is getting the better of us somebodys got to step up
7433564 and whether that happens by making a big play and guys rally around it or whether its telling them hey you got to get on this
7433565 were not very deep the problems are apparent in terms of depth but i wouldnt throw any of our guys back i think theyre all talented guys and i think theyre all getting better
7433566 its a different feel to be a veteran from the past two years where i was kind of under the older guys
7433567 its basically the same thing now i try to come out to work and improve and get better but also help the younger guys have them ask me questions i also have to be a general out on the field so its a little different but im ready for the challenge
7433568 you cant really baby them because you know this is college football theyre going to be facing a lot of things so you just throw them out there and see how they respond thats how theyre going to gain experience
7433569 he inspired me to play cornerback because of the way he plays and how smart he plays hes not only a good player on the field but off the field he has exceptional grades he never says no to you when you ask him for a favor hes been a big help in my life
7433570 for a young kid i feel sorry for him but hes all weve got and hes good enough to come through
7433571 the bruin family sends our deepest heartfelt sympathy to the cornish family

7433584 everybody wants to talk about nba players being selfish and arrogant and individuals
7433585 but what you saw today was a team bonding and facing adversity and coming out with a big win

7433587 kobe hes a special player hes the best player on the planet right now
7433588 kobe loves that situation if he has the ball and we need a basket we know we can count on him
7433589 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear

7433599 but we dont sit here cowed by anything weve seen
7433600 we have been dazzled we have been impressed we have been blown away by these beijing games but we have not been intimidated and in our own sweet way without wasting tax payers money i am convinced that we can do just as well in 2012
7433601 in tata motors if you look at the entire series of events which has happened and particularly after stupendous victory on jlr the land rovers deal so to that extent it is slightly disappointing but having said that if you look at the costs involved and what are the alternatives that the government has whether the investments the government has and to that extent what tata motors has my sense is there is going to be an amicable solution there are some compulsions from various interested parties but that will come to an amicable solution with some alterations in the existing thing but it is likely to go ahead at the current singur facility itself so i see it maybe with a delay of one month or so things will come back on track so i dont see much of a problem in that respect
7433602 if there is a sentiment impact which is likely to be because obviously the uncertainty has build in and to that extent even if you postpone it by a quarter or lets say two months also to that extent your cash flows is getting impacted so to that extent there is an impact but that impact could be an opportunity because overall if you look at we have already seen quite a decline in the stock prices which has made it to reasonable valuation level may not be immediate term but if somebody is looking from a one year kind of horizon not in short term but one year horizon it is looking attractive
7433603 the authorities still do not trust chinese catholics and feel threatened when we exercise our faith
7433604 the stock at the current market price of rs 218 will trade 3 97 times to its earnings of rs 54 96 ttm and 1 06 times to its book value of rs 206 and is expected to provide huge upside potential in medium to long term we initiate a buy signal on the stock at the current levels with a target of rs 335 in the medium to long term investment horizon with an appreciation of 53 35
7433605 technology looks attractive today because their revenue is getting a boost from rupee weakening and in addition i think the pressure of outsourcing is increasing globally even in domestic segment i think they are able to build businesses so overall technology sector looks good

7433607 we will meet hatred with love we will continue to work for justice our hearts and the doors of our more than 1 000 unitarian universalist congregations nationwide remain open unitarian universalists stand on the side of love we invite you to stand with us
7433608 we started thinking about whether there was a message we wanted to share beyond our own uu community
7433609 to reaffirm the values we hold and to say that in spite of the tragedy and loss and grief we were not going to retreat from offering open doors and open hearts
7433610 we decided that we had something that was worth saying and that the
7433611 people were grateful that wed used this way to speak out about our values
7433612 it felt to them like taking advantage of a tragic situation
7433613 im sure that after the tragedy a lot of folks went to youtube
7433614 i think many of us are here to stand with you after this tragedy

7433616 faith in action communities of faith bring hope for the planet
7433617 one of the incredible gifts to us has been the weaving of relationships between us and the people who produce our food
7433618 and now there is a critical mass of people within the church who really get it about local foods and sustainability and being mindful about what you eat and where it comes from and its a joy to go around the state and talk about the ministry of local food
7433619 our church has been in rockland a fishing port since 1820 i look at this new relationship as a reweaving of a historical relationship its very precious to us were helping this group of fishermen do the right thing in very difficult times for them
7433620 the csa has been empowering for church members it is so easy to get overwhelmed by the scope of the issues we face eating locally is a simple tangible change that has a real effect on congregants lives and everyone involved including the earth
7433621 allowing us to put our faith into action and to have an effect in our real sphere of influence which is our own lives

7433626 a son and a brother of sen joseph r biden jr d del are accused in two lawsuits of defrauding a former business partner and an investor of millions of dollars in a hedge fund deal that went sour court records show
7433627 the democratic vice presidential candidates son hunter 38 and brother james 59 assert instead that their former partner defrauded them by misrepresenting his experience in the hedge fund industry and recommending that they hire a lawyer with felony convictions
7433628 a lawsuit filed by their former partner anthony lotito jr asserts in court papers that the deal was crafted to get hunter biden out of lobbying because his father was concerned about the impact it would have on his bid for the white house biden was running for the democratic nomination at the time the suit was filed
7433629 hunter biden was made president with an annual salary of 1 2 million despite his inexperience in the hedge fund industry the lawsuit said
7433630 before that he had been part of the washington law firm oldaker biden amp belair which earned 1 76 million in lobbying revenue in the first half of 2006 according to congressional quarterlys cq moneyline
7433631 lotitos lawsuit alleges that james biden called him in january 2006 to arrange a job for hunter biden

7433649 during the time that pineda started doing jewelry the trend was more ethnic and if you look at his pieces youll see that theyre very modern looking and this was in the late 40s and early 50s before that was what other people were doing
7433650 looking at some of the earliest pieces you can really see that it was a very nascent tradition that was growing in taxco
7433651 it was very much a place of enormous conversation and dialogue and exchange of ideas revolutionary ideas
7433652 he talks about the struggle it was to find his own style and his own voice and to not be in the shadow of william spratling
7433653 you see very much as you go through the exhibition that he really did establish his own style he was very bold and very experimental
7433654 in contrast to his mentor spratling pineda was also a silversmith he was not just a designer and artist
7433655 he really had a sense of the possibility of the metal an enormous respect for that material and the ways it could be worked to great effect
7433656 we saw a bracelet of his and it was a fantastic design and a heavy piece of silver jewelry my wife put it on and it just felt like velvet on her wrist and that was how we first got acquainted with him
7433657 unlike a lot of the rappers ive never been in a gang sold drugs or shot anyone and i wont rap about that

7433659 your body temperature must be less than 90 degrees cause youre acute girl at any angle that i look not to mention youre the educated type no stranger to a book those are just two of the reasons i can see you with me i love you and thats reason no 3
7433660 my favorite number is three and the song undo was written for a girl whose favorite number is 26
7433661 since i am a math person 3 26 is like a ratio three to 26 me to her i proposed the idea to the rest of the group and they didnt mind now here we are 3 26
7433662 im a plate of simile with a cup of metaphor side of some hyperbole and innuendos galore a euphemism allusion alliteration dessert i dont need your little tips just sit and get served
7433663 school is a big part of my life and every song i make usually has references that all students can relate to even the song in which every rapper brags about himself
7433664 ucla invitation elation show up at orientation realization to my fascination whole population asians caucasians beyond imagination i need an explanation maybe blacks have late registration maybe browns got board of education
7433665 i was taking education classes during the quarter i was writing the song and learning a lot about inequalities that are going on and the rallies about the diversity crisis i wanted to address that in the song
7433666 my main goal is to finish school this year and be the first person in my family to do so
7433667 i will then get a masters degree in education and eventually go back to my high school to teach math over half of carson high doesnt graduate as seen in many other underprivileged schools it needs more caring teachers and i think i could help contribute to the overall cause
7433668 if theres anything i could do with music that would help kids want to go to college i would definitely be on the list for that
7433669 i am just taking it track by track for now
7433670 im focusing on finishing school and just seeing what happens next
7433671 i want to do things that ive never done before
7433672 people dont really know you until you get out there and make plays and thats what i want to do
7433673 we knew it this time last year we knew that reggie would be the guy to step in
7433674 hes always around the ball so everybodys confident we all know he can get the job done
7433675 people always like to look at teams that are winning and lately we havent been winning too much
7433676 the team we have this year if were winning theyre definitely going to notice us
7433677 were going to do some great things you just wait and see
7433678 its just that hes young once he gets the full grasp of the defense hes going to do great things
7433679 i wish we could have it all across the board the more competition you have the more youre going to get out of each player
7433680 its my last year potentially playing football so any chance i get to be on the field and play im going to play as hard as i can i got to try and be a leader out here and this is it for me hopefully we can end on a high note
7433681 during the game i was disappointed as anybody would be
7433682 but im a firm believer that everything happens for a reason last year happened and last year is over so its a new year its a new day new knee new everything so were going to try and put last year behind us and were going to move forward and try to establish ucla as a program to be reckoned with
7433683 really kind of shocked that it happened as quickly as it did but you know what im truly blessed and fortunate
7433684 i just hope that he can continue to get better physically and he can have the kind of senior year i think he deserves and has worked for
7433685 last year around this time i was injured so im just happy i can make it through another day
7433686 the injury was pretty tough because i had my mind set on playing but a lot of things happen everything happens for a reason so thats why i have to bounce back and come back ready so i can be ready to go this year
7433687 were working on getting better getting ready for the season
7433688 the whole team everybody individually brings some energy to the team and im just another portion of that energy im another portion of pushing everybody else to work hard and get better so were all pushing each other
7433689 its no individual somebody doing something different so we all in this together
7433690 you just got to bide your time when you get your chance you just got to run at it im just ready to play the only thing i can do is keep working and whenever they call my number be ready to do whatever i can do
7433691 i think that we got some great looking kids over there that are all eager to have a ball in their arms but they also have to learn the offense and do all the other things that go with that position in terms of protection and understanding how to read blocks
7433692 like i said if they call my number i just want to be ready

7433697 and maybe ill just go study see what went wrong at wimbledon
7433698 thats the plan but i dont think either of us is aiming for 2
7433699 and i was taking the injections so i dont feel the pain when i was going on you know to play my matches otherwise i wouldnt be able to go on court and play but now its finished and now its just a matter of you know getting you know firm again getting all these muscles back and feeling like i used to feel before when i was fit and ready to play
7433700 somehow i started to go out there and started to believe im a player and i can compete with them
7433701 maybe before it was missing this and then i could not give them answers but now i go out there and for their game i can always give them my answer my game thats why i start to beat them

7433716 people just seem to be on the grounds perfectly happy not to leave
7433717 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
7433718 who right now may be afraid to eat uncooked produce
7433719 its one big step forward in improving the safety of fresh produce
7433720 it kills the bacteria makes it so they are not able to reproduce and make you sick
7433721 its a high tech solution to problems that should be solved earlier in the food chain

7433729 youd have to severely cut into education which i dont think is the right thing you would severely cut into healthcare which is not the right thing to do you would severely have to cut into prisons and we cant do that
7433730 fix the budget system once and for all so this will never ever happen again
7433731 do a compromise where you make the democrats do something they never would have done and make we republicans do something we normally would never do
7433732 i just think the wisest thing to do is to go to the people and say look i know ive said no taxes
7433733 we dont want to exchange multi year spending cuts for a one year budget
7433734 we republicans have all been united in our belief that the state has a spending and not a revenue problem
7433735 it is so discouraging to see the governor walk away from these core principles
7433736 i want to be a public servant not a party servant i mean im a supporter of my party and im a republican but were supposed to serve the people not the party
7433737 i hate tax increases but im willing to go beyond my beliefs and ideology to make a compromise its the only way we can solve this budget problem
7433738 now that we know that lawyers are going to be prosecuted for it like terry christensen we know that we have to keep that in mind and be more careful than in the past
7433739 they would normally call you and say i need a b and c
7433740 theyll say i want this all done legally and i want no wink winks
7433741 maybe it makes them a little more conscious in their instructions to investigators to make sure they observe the law
7433742 the adversary system is based on notions of fair play and i think what makes this of such great concern is the spying if it did happen in this way is so inconsistent with that basic rule
7433743 everybody scurries and becomes much more careful then eventually with time people forget
7433744 obviously i dont want to go to jail and i want to keep my lawyers and clients out of jail thats always in the back of my mind
7433745 the public doesnt know the risk they are running by their everyday actions
7433746 simple negligence is something that might be charged if you are driving at the speed limit and blow a red light
7433747 gross negligence occurs when you have behavior verging on reckless without due regard for human life

7433750 the offenders that work for class i industries are paid a prevailing wage
7433751 theyre helping their families and offsetting the costs of incarceration and it cuts down on idleness inside the institutions
7433752 the advantage is its free rent they dont pay for the space they occupy they do however pay for the utilities at market rate and it is an available work force
7433753 we make sure theres no issues on the business side of it we also look at the economic impact to make sure theyre not impacting outside businesses then it goes through a federal program

7433777 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7433778 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7433779 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7433780 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7433781 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7433782 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7433783 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7433784 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7433785 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7433786 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7433787 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7433788 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7433789 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7433790 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7433791 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7433792 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7433793 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7433794 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7433795 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7433796 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7433797 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7433798 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7433799 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7433800 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7433801 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7433802 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7433803 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7433804 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7433805 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7433806 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7433807 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7433808 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7433809 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7433810 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7433811 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7433812 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7433813 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7433814 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7433815 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7433816 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7433817 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7433818 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7433819 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7433820 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7433821 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7433822 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7433823 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7433824 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7433825 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7433826 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7433827 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7433828 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7433829 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7433830 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7433831 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7433832 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7433833 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7433834 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7433835 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7433836 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7433837 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7433838 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7433839 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7433840 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7433841 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7433842 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7433843 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7433844 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7433845 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7433846 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7433847 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7433848 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7433849 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7433850 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7433851 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7433852 this is a planning took where all things are going
7433853 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7433854 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7433855 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7433856 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7433857 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7433858 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7433859 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7433860 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7433861 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7433862 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7433863 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7433864 im having so much fun ive been so busy i dont think ive worked this much before
7433865 going into that class for two years and learning so many new things and coming back to the show on has made such a tremendous difference in my work and how comfortable i am and being able to take the character from one place to another its sort of a dream come true
7433866 ive had such a great time since ive been back i do feel like ive been gone for a while because im a different person and the character has changed
7433867 isnt he good and hes the nicest guy on the planet its so refreshing to work with someone that evil and he does it in such a slight way that its creepy but in a good way hes intending to do that and hes so good a it and i feel very fortunate to work with him
7433868 i love working with james hes so great we work a lot together on our stuff well come in early or work on stage quite a bit now that the fans like the two of us together just to create something more every time we have scenes together
7433869 she always gave me so much just as a woman as an actress everything such a wonderful person all around she did so much with that character she could have easily played that character into a wall and she didnt she did such a good job with it
7433870 with the film noir ive been given a slightly added enjoyment to my day because every day is kind of a challenge it gives me the ability to try and do something extra
7433871 its hysterical and it was so well written and it was so much fun to do
7433872 its almost like youre going into a room and pitching and hoping that millions of people hit your website rather than just one executive producer or studio saying okay well take your show
7433873 you may not want to help me after you hear the rest of what ive got to say im taking michelle with me
7433874 nobody emphasized public service what was emphasized was doing what you love to do and youll be good at whatever you do
7433875 her father asked her dont you want to pay your student loans
7433876 im sure at sidley she made more money than her parents ever made
7433877 it just seemed incredible at the time that shed leave
7433878 her being from chicago from the southside of chicago was an asset to barack in terms of enhancing his ties to the community
7433879 he couldve gone to wall street those offers were available to him but instead barack bussed these young mothers down to city hall to help them find their voice and advocate for change
7433880 everyone had said at the time that the best young organizer in chicago was barack
7433881 at a time when the average age of our staff was 23 she was like drafting brett favre for the packers
7433882 michelle was 29 when we hired her she had a law degree from harvard had worked for the mayor for a corporate law firm comparatively id worked a telemarketing group frankly we were surprised that she wanted to do it
7433883 she was a connector they were a power couple they helped each other along the way
7433884 each ally was placed with a not for profit about 20 30 a year when you think of the number of people who got to know who michelle was and by extension barack thats a whole generation from all over chicago
7433885 no really baracks a hustler i shouldnt say hustler but hes a humper in terms of work
7433886 as a precautionary measure to ensure that law and order is maintained
7433887 the blockade was made out to be much worse than it probably was
7433888 in effect it was like a psychological war a fear psychosis was created where people panicked about shortage of medicines and milk for children about truckloads of apples rotting how much was fact and how much rumor no one knows
7433889 the only solution is to get people back on the table to talk
7433890 but for that they need to wait for passions to cool
7433891 they themselves are not agreed on whether they want freedom or merger with pakistan
7433892 they wont give up their personal security but will demand troops be removed from the valley
7433893 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7433894 while still in the shock and sorrow of reza hejazis execution i just heard of imminent execution of bahman soleimanian
7433895 today bahman soleimanian mohammad fadaee behnood shojaee behnam zare and all those who are sentenced to death for a crime committed during childhood are in need of our help and support
7433896 no big 12 conference team has less than six home games
7433897 were in the process of negotiating with both schools to try to finalize a more long term deal
7433898 our goal is having it in denver with the idea of creating a big event the entire state can celebrate
7433899 the game is important to both schools not only the athletic watch video of csu tight end kory sperry watch video of csu football scrimmage and interview with coach steve fairchild visit natalie meislers all things rams blog for a behind the scenes look at csu sports play pickem for the upcoming csu football game programs but the city of denver the state and for the good of college football
7433900 whether we play the rams or another marquee game is a viable option to look at after a fundamental number of games are in place in boulder and the fundamental number is six
7433901 he feels that with a year of redshirting he will get better as an athlete and better as a runner watch video of cu coach dan hawkins on first day of practice watch video of cu freshman running back darrell scott watch video of cu beginning fall practice play pickem for the upcoming cu football game if thats what he wants to do then hey thats fine
7433902 they keep talking about rivalries we might have one now
7433903 thats one of those deals where i couldnt get by him and i couldnt get by him and i just had to ask myself would he do that to me and he has before so thats the way it goes
7433904 whatever well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7433905 ill probably catch up on a lot of sleep the next few days
7433906 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7433907 they definitely outplayed us i dont know im kind of shell shocked as to what happened
7433908 it seemed like every time we got something they answered right back theyre a veteran very talented team im disappointed but this was a great group of guys
7433909 he was probably more fired up about it than i was
7433910 ive had a long career ive had my time to shine as a starter
7433911 ive played a lot of football i dont have to be the starter on this team as long as i have a role that can help this offense win
7433912 i think i showed a lot friday i was able to catch the ball out of the backfield i tried to run with authority and block at the same there are things i could do better
7433913 hes hitting the ball well hes kicking off really well it looks like hes having a good preseason i wish him the best
7433914 muy a lo vende motos como mario luna pero no era l
7433915 ostras si es tan grande porque no me he enterado
7433916 no me vendan la moto y que fueran m s humildes
7433917 this is the best of times and worst of times
7433918 my son couldnt make the trip hes back home with his grandma but i wanted to bring a little piece of him to china
7433919 we hope this can put a smile on the face of hugh and members of the bachman family even if only for a second
7433920 i had to step out and collect my thoughts and collect my emotions
7433921 nothing else to say there just listening to each other smile on the phone
7433922 you keep doing your job and hope the routine of things will carry you through each new day
7433923 but wait sean he doesnt do just one event how do you think he got the 8 golds
7433924 as a player ive got to take this momentum this confidence into the season
7433925 my main thing was going out there and doing things other than scoring defending the other teams best players rebounding and just helping my team out
7433926 hes already one of the best players in the world
7433927 and this is only going to enhance what he can already do especially if he starts playing on the other side of the ball like hes playing here
7433928 hes guarded dirk nowitzki luis scola guys who are really good players and hes rebounded well
7433929 the international game is so physical and hes probably our most physical guy him and dwyane wade
7433930 hes guarding tougher guys hes helping better ive seen a big improvement defensively in lebron james carmelo dwyane noticeable improvement since they started here
7433931 he gets into little things on the court well hes protecting his teammates hes a glue guy with unbelievable talent its great to have him
7433932 they have given their very best in a fair play environment and achieved amazing results
7433933 at previous conventions the parties and candidates would hope that the video would be shown to the television audience and if you were at home watching you might see it said andrew rasiej co founder of
7433934 but if you didnt catch the video about john kerry in 2004 your ability to see that video was pretty much lost

7433947 un gran debate nacional sobre las condiciones de la seguridad a rea

7433954 zapatero tiene pavor al debate de financiaci n auton mica
7433955 a zapatero no es que no le preocupe la financiaci n auton mica sino que le da pavor los suyo ha sido una aut ntica espantada se ha librado de tener que explicar en el congreso la reforma de financiaci n de los grandes servicios sociales que est n en manos de comunidades y ayuntamientos as como del reparto de impuestos de todos los espa oles en su lugar ha mandado al ministro de econom a pedro solbes
7433956 el gobierno est cada vez m s solitario en el congreso como demuestra el hecho de que negocie la financiaci n con alg n grupo minoritario
7433957 apoyar el proyecto del gobierno socialista cuando la crisis econ mica que vive espa a se est agravando y ste no est haciendo sus deberes conlleva un desgaste pol tico enorme
7433958 en pol tica hay que tener criterio propio y solbes no lo tiene la medida de los 400 euros no era suya el ministro de industria miguel sebasti n lo cont en un art culo y todo el mundo lo sabe y sin embargo aplic la deducci n de mala gana hay que tener mucho cuidado con esta forma de hacer pol tica
7433959 esto es lo que me dijeron en 2004 pero son elecciones que nada tienen que ver con las decisiones que ya tom el partido en su momento
7433960 vamos a batir el r cord en marketing dirigido a los hispanos
7433961 si los presupuestos no se prorrogan es porque el gobierno nos ha vendido
7433962 el debate que ha abierto zapatero sobre financiaci n desvertebra el modelo de estado y la unidad nacional
7433963 estos han sido los juegos de las apariencias y de las mentiras
7433964 la acumulaci n de incidencias en las centrales nucleares durante los ltimos meses y la reciente propuesta de sanci n millonaria a la planta de asc por irregularidades en el mantenimiento obligan a considerar que su proceso de conservaci n requiere un incremento de calidad y medios para evitar peri dicas alarmas y minimizar los riesgos
7433965 cada vez que se les da una oportunidad de manifestarse la aprovechan para lanzar soflamas amenazantes para hacer apolog a del terrorismo o para enaltecer a pistoleros

7433977 mom passed away this afternoon she is out of pain and at peace now
7433978 it kind of helped me collect my thoughts from what were extremely chaotic mind numbing days
7433979 when you get that kind of diagnosis you dont want to tell too many people because its hard enough to deal with it
7433980 how many of us know how truly loved we are before we die i think my mom did
7433981 when i first started doing that stuff no i was not internet savvy i was afraid of the internet actually
7433982 but when i stopped working what was i going to do aside from taking care of my dog i had to start playing on the internet a lot
7433983 i know that my doctor will not be happy to hear that i stopped taking my medication when i did he might be hearing of it firsthand as i know that he reads my e newsletters and might even now be reading what i post to this blog
7433984 how very selfish they say of those same athletes to work their entire lives sacrificing blood sweat and tears to get to these very moments and then fail to mention their homosexuality
7433985 very critical regarding the numbers of athletes closeting themselves at the olympics
7433986 in the name of the olympic spirit and humanity shut up and let gay athletes focus on the endeavors that they have worked so hard to reach
7433987 no rainbow flags at beijing games olympics are not the place for gay politics
7433988 shutting up is part of the problem the reason we cant name many gay sports stars isnt because the media are bored with them its because there are hardly any coming out stories to report
7433989 people do rachel and me a disservice by assuming we were anything like the people in that movie
7433990 rachel and my love story is a hell of a lot more romantic than that
7433991 the only thing i remember is we both went down swingin and we called it a draw

7434011 we have briefed the family of the missing person inspector lefevre said
7434012 it was all very civilised unlike previous visits i have had from police
7434013 our findings support the idea that bondage and discipline and sadomasochism bdsm is simply a sexual interest or subculture attractive to a minority
7434014 however they were no more likely to have been coerced into sexual activity and were not significantly more likely to be unhappy or anxious
7434015 people with these sexual interests have long been seen by medicine and the law as at best damaged and in need of therapy and at worst dangerous and in need of legal regulation
7434016 and need particularly strong stimuli such as being beaten or tied up to become aroused
7434017 you would expect more arrests because were searching more people we want to stop the small minority from coming and spoiling it for everyone else
7434018 la cina non e mai stata cos tanto sotto lo sguardo del mondo

7434025 a break up will do nothing to accelerate the delivery of that
7434026 i think baa is focused on the issue no i dont think a break up is the answer i dont think it will introduce competition
7434027 i believe the government recognises the importance to the uk of an efficient hub airport and a third runway
7434028 this is another innovative development in the academy programme that will drive up standards of education for local children
7434029 this isnt invention for its own sake weve looked at what needs to happen in ashington and developed a model that answers that need
7434030 we will have no difficulty moving beyond 400 we will make the political decision in due course on where we go beyond 400 on the basis of the results and the demand the only issue is how far
7434031 its an open question whether we have one or are losing the one weve got
7434032 arguably the greatest political and bureaucratic fiasco in the history of the world
7434033 so while its wonderful to show the rest of the world that iran is a great place to ski
7434034 if they think a patient will gain an extra year of life but it will cost more than 20 000 they think it is not cost effective yet if the patient wants to pay for it themselves they are denied nhs treatment its an outrage
7434035 the nhs was built on the foundation of caring for the community it was designed to help those who needed help care for those who needed care and treat those who needed treatment
7434036 those basic principals have been lost as the government takes us down a dangerous path that can only be a catastrophic meltdown of the system
7434037 ten years ago waits of 18 months were not uncommon but by the end of this year no one should wait longer than 18 weeks none of this would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of everyone working into he nhs

7434043 but the railway is vital not just for the georgian economy but for the economies of neighbouring countries
7434044 georgia provides an alternative corridor for exporting oil and gas that is not controlled by russia
7434045 russia tried everything possible to make sure this corridor does not exist any more

7434050 the chinese ladies would fall to their knees and their score would maybe drop a couple of hundredths of a point how is that possible can it be that they favored the home team
7434051 younger gymnasts are considered to have an advantage because they are more flexible and are likely to have an easier time doing the tough skills the sport requires they also arent as likely to have a history of injuries or fear of failure
7434052 first of all to caroline learn how to type and spell it is very annoying when you post something for all to read and it makes you look like someone who does not care how others see you i like my life and im happy to be in a country where you can speak your mind and have free will to do things as you wish

7434063 build a base of local merchants who are unique and who can co exist with friendly center
7434064 i was primarily impressed with the general agreement that the city and other organizations need to pay more attention to retail
7434065 its the type of hit that occurs once or twice a year around the world
7434066 i have guys i have to take care of right now
7434067 we have to take care of the gfeller family and their wishes too but we have a football team i have to take care of and seven other coaches and we have to get ourselves back together and be able to get through this
7434068 were dealing not only with our own grief but with how to help our own kids
7434069 i dont know how you could ever really prepare for something like this you never go to a high school football game or any sporting event and think youll end up at baptist hospital praying for your sons life
7434070 i knew matt and his family from back when i was in elementary school i never imagined this tragedy to happen to him i know everyone family friends and strangers that are grieving over this loss keep him and his family in your prayers
7434071 as the athletic trainer at reynolds high i only met matt a couple times he was a very hard worker you could tell he had true love for the game if there are any reynolds players or any football players that need a shoulder to lean on i am here for you to the gfeller family thank you for all you do reynolds high just gained an angel
7434072 i am truly saddened and truly sorry for your loss its hard to move on and its hard to concentrate now because a young mans life was taken away on sunday august 24th 2008 i will be praying for the gfeller family r i p matt
7434073 i was disappointed but i think i had done everything i knew to do
7434074 he has shown a lot of interest in good issues frye says
7434075 and i think what he did has helped to get other lawyers to do the same its hard to get people to take death penalty cases
7434076 everyone was happy to see me and talk with me as long as i wanted to talk
7434077 they were as cordial and polite as anyone in that position could be
7434078 he told me he accepted his fate but insisted he didnt do it
7434079 if my client had been a fortune 500 company and cowan has represented such companies my fee would have been 400 000 or 500 000
7434080 a lot of lawyers feel their pro bono responsibility is part of being a lawyer he says
7434081 there are lots of lawyers who have done this more than i have nothing i did was unusual
7434082 i guess thats the fun of making a story theres definitely some messages i want to get across
7434083 it gives the kids sort of a metaphor to overcome
7434084 its kind of like the frustration we got going into the county commissioners last summer saying please dont cut our funding
7434085 any kind of education is important especially because you wouldnt expect it in a stairwell
7434086 the biggest concern the irs has is getting these people to claim the money theyre entitled to
7434087 if theyre eligible for benefits we want them to get them
7434088 for people who dont have to file a tax return its just kind of an odd situation in many cases they may not have filed a federal income tax return in several years
7434089 its a very simple form to fill out and its not nearly as complicated as a regular tax return
7434090 its a very streamlined form and it probably takes about 10 minutes to fill out and then it just needs to be sent in
7434091 and i think the irs has been surprised at how much money is left unclaimed but when you have a group of seniors not filing tax returns thats logical to me social security isnt taxed and all those social security recipients might not even know theyre eligible
7434092 it takes no time at all for us to help them complete their returns theyre very simple its 15 minutes in and out
7434093 if they dont have that 1099 but they have a record of what they received for any particular month last year we can do a workaround
7434094 im hopeful that people who are eligible will apply and get their checks i just feel very happy to be able to do this for these folks
7434095 we strongly believe that it doesnt matter who you vote for as long as you vote
7434096 getting to rerecord a classic song like this was a real honor for us and we hope it helps inspire people to vote
7434097 if for example someone wants to encourage an ordinance that goats be allowed in the backyard
7434098 the whole island is still in a bit of a tizzy and on edge
7434099 oh my god were still moving why are we still moving
7434100 my parents are on a plane coming in will the airport be okay
7434101 i cant get through to my childrens school i wonder if they are okay
7434102 fasten your seat belts were in for a bumpy ride
7434103 but obamas newness and message of change can take people out of their comfort level biden gives people a little bit more of a comfort back
7434104 he isnt going to be throwing the bomb on every play
7434105 the reality of it is there was no perfect choice
7434106 there are issues involved with foreign policy and obamas experience that biden covers
7434107 the fact of the matter is we dont know what any of them are going to do until they get in office
7434108 do you select as your surgeon someone who just got out of medical school or someone who has been doing it for 20 years
7434109 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
7434110 has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
7434111 has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite u s presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality while sen mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
7434112 were monitoring closely and will have something to say when an agreement is finalized
7434113 at this point obama looks a little less reckless than he might have a few months ago
7434114 i dont think this gets the issue off the table
7434115 between now and election day not a lot of troops are going to come home
7434116 has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
7434117 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
7434118 theyd say youd never believe who used to live there
7434119 weve been told by real estate professionals this could add 100 000 in value
7434120 its not going to add anything like that at all
7434121 may be too closely aligned with people who hold radical political views
7434122 die branche und die besucher unterst tzen uns eindeutig darin die messe in leipzig fortzuf hren
7434123 is a deal of the past and almost certainly will not be replicated even as a political gesture of goodwill
7434124 there has never been a single pricing point in the gcc
7434125 in fact there still is no single price marker internationally either lng fetches different prices in different basins regionally the dolphin deal was priced on a cost plus basis as an anchor point however the natural gas futures contract traded in the us priced off henry hub in louisiana has climbed from 2 mmbtu in 1991 to over 8 mmbtu currently in asia lng prices can go as high as 20 mmbtu
7434126 a new agreement to fill the pipelines 3 5bcf d potential will not be achieved without a significant increase in the price paid for the gas of probably 10 fold or more
7434127 as more expensive indigenous gas sources and imports whether lng or pipeline becomes a bigger part of the total energy mix there will be economic implications for governments as long as heavy subsidies for grid gas and power exist
7434128 the regions natural cost advantage is being slowly eroded and subsidy regimes have to be revised to achieve sustainability
7434129 with lng liquefied natural gas achieving asian prices of up to 20 mmbtu any new pipeline deals would have to provide qatar the regions de facto central bank for gas with a corresponding netback price
7434130 this might not necessarily be as high as global average lng prices given the lower capital investments but certainly above the 5 6 mmbtu figures often mentioned by senior officials
7434131 given the higher costs of any new import deals the value proposition for developing domestic sources of supply increases
7434132 if youve got to pay 10 11 mmbtu for lng then it would now make sense to develop more problematic gas sources even if the cost were say 4 5 mmbtu so yes the higher gas price environment does offer upside to future exploration
7434133 a pipeline serving a specific customer with a fixed volume would remove the trade and arbitrage opportunities offered by an lng project
7434134 despite this acceptance of a drastically new price paradigm there still seems to be a reluctance to accept similar prices for pipeline gas a fact reflected by the absence of any operational projects dolphin aside regionally and in other emerging markets
7434135 if and when the moratorium on new gas projects is lifted though this looks increasingly unlikely qatars neighbours will come further down the priority list behind domestic industrialisation and petrochemicals
7434136 on the upside a rapprochement between qatar and its neighbours over the past two years does provide a degree of political will to strengthen ties through a pipeline deal although government policy aimed at maintaining gas production for two to three generations means that any future decisions will be deeply scrutinised
7434137 facing increasingly tight oil product balances iran has also been driving policies aimed at substituting gasoline and diesel with gas in industry as well as transport tehrans resource mis management in the past means that it is simply over extending itself in trying to do everything
7434138 both dubai and bahrain are said to be pursuing buyback deals to import 1bcf d while oman is also manoeuvring to import similar volumes
7434139 this is already a strong market for us and we are excited to position the company in this key business area this is an excellent place to live and a perfect environment from which to forge a working climate that is germane to the progression of international business

7434141 the towers are completely down now and the demolition has been carried out as planned the site is now completely safe
7434142 one tower came down completely as expected and then there was about one third of the other one left standing but angled away from the viaduct as the demolition experts designed it to
7434143 people were looking at it saying are we supposed to be able to see it but the demolition crew went to the site and manipulated what remained so that it has now completely come down

7434161 its kind of the last piece of the puzzle you might say of crystal cove state park that we worked on for about 30 years to get in place
7434162 there is just no room anymore for these little private enclaves of people
7434163 that was something from the past and it couldnt continue theres this huge public pressure to get to the coast and be able to camp on the coast and enjoy it
7434164 watching it just sit there in a really bad physical state has really disappointed us
7434165 there had to have been some way for the state and the residents of el morro to work together to see that that didnt happen that there was a more orderly transition
7434166 its just taken us nearly three decades to get to the point where the public will really enjoy this
7434167 id just like my kids to be able to enjoy that spot like i was able to enjoy it
7434168 most people would go to rats and mice for lab testing but when it comes to testing new wound therapies or products and cosmetics that go on human skin pig skin is our closest alternative and is most often used
7434169 however this is expensive the test numbers are limited and of course there are ethical problems to consider so using a human skin equivalent will reduce this use and possibly give more accurate results
7434170 obviously the ultimate goal is for labs to avoid having to use animals altogether eventually
7434171 it is showing the model we use explaining how we go about making it and how these skin equivalents are used to guide and minimise the use of animals when we develop new wound healing therapies
7434172 we collect skin donated by consenting patients who have had surgery resulting in a surgical off cut and the skin is then processed in our laboratory to isolate the cells once they are growing healthily again we can bring them back together and create the multi component skin equivalent in the lab

7434222 en ninguna parte en frica se conoce un nivel tal de agresividad contra algunos periodistas
7434223 es probable que el aporte de la ayuda extranjera y otros flujos financieros provenientes del pillaje del congo sea al menos parcialmente el responsable de los resultados positivos de la econom a en ruanda
7434224 la econom a ruandesa sigue siendo extremadamente vulnerable y est confrontada a una combinaci n de factores estructurales problem ticos como la sobrepoblaci n la escasez de recursos la gran dependencia de la agricultura de subsistencia y un limitado potencial de diversificaci n econ mica

7434227 exactly what type and color dress are you looking for
7434228 please dont take this the wrong way but gowns of that nature are considered more appropriate for brides who are being married the first time for those who are a bit more innocent if you know what i mean perhaps ivory or sky blue would be nice
7434229 i can assure you that a white gown would be quite appropriate
7434230 believe it or not despite all my marriages i remain as innocent as a
7434231 you see my first husband was so excited about our wedding he died as we
7434232 it just shows the bankruptcy of their campaign they have no relevant ideas
7434233 im the guy who probably in the mind of a lot of democrats is if not the most qualified then qualified
7434234 adjustments have been made but it is along the same lines of events that weve had in the past
7434235 that is not to say that there will be no parties at the conventions
7434236 we are just following the guidelines of the ethics committee and we are completely staying within what they have deemed appropriate
7434237 i dont like the role of stepping in and being a party pooper
7434238 it is the members of congress that will have to face the consequences of any violations
7434239 the governor had an obligation to raise funds for the convention and the financial obligation is tremendous
7434240 this is about civic pride for the state of colorado from our unions perspective we are supporting the democratic candidate and party and it needs to have the money to run a good convention program you cant do it in a pup tent
7434241 its not some secretive soft money slush fund because its really going to a convention
7434242 its important for him and the convention as a whole to lay out the distinctions and comparisons between himself and mccain
7434243 he needs to show that he can take off the gloves
7434244 my main goal at this convention and through my speech is to convey a sense of urgency that so many families are feeling across the country
7434245 and to present a clear choice between continuing the same economic policies and a new approach
7434246 he needs to introduce himself to voters who know him by name but not by substance
7434247 she has to get up and tell her supporters i trust sen
7434248 you cant do that in this kind of political environment with a 24 7 news cycle the internet youtube there has to be an aggressive compare and contrast
7434249 this campaign presents a very stark choice to the american people
7434250 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7434251 its a unique opportunity for candidates to focus attention on themselves and their message for four nights mostly unvarnished and unimpeded
7434252 its almost like a gateway to the real show the fall campaign
7434253 it is the desire of this new company to capitalise on this growing market demand

7434274 i think were on the verge of enacting groundbreaking legislation
7434275 this is essential for us to begin to really start looking at toxics in products
7434276 right now everything we look at and have been looking at are emissions wastes and discharges
7434277 we have lunchboxes that contain lead when you throw them out we can treat them as hazardous waste but a kid could eat out of it every day and theres not much we can do about it right now
7434278 people are not only surprised to find that the state currently doesnt have authority over products that contain dangerous chemicals they expect that the state should
7434279 right now most californians assume that state government has the authority to take toxic products off the shelves thats actually not true except in a very few specific cases where the legislature has acted this would be a really important breakthrough
7434280 but were encouraged by it this kind of format is much more preferred than what were dealing with in the legislature
7434281 i strongly believe there needs to be a systemic way to address these types of concerns
7434282 there does need to be some effort to curb plastics
7434283 its the same thing as the price of gas it would force you to conserve

7434341 however they were no more likely to have been coerced into sexual activity and were not significantly more likely to be unhappy or anxious
7434342 people with these sexual interests have long been seen by medicine and the law as at best damaged and in need of therapy and at worst dangerous and in need of legal regulation

7434396 as a minister i cannot help remarking that there is hardly any subject about which people seem so tenacious as they are about their children i have sometimes been perfectly astonished at the slowness of sensible christian parents to allow that their own children are in fault or deserve blame there are not a few persons to whom i would far rather speak about their own sins than tell them their children had done anything wrong
7434397 remember children are born with a decided bias towards evil and therefore if you let them choose for themselves they are certain to choose wrong

7434458 we have briefed the family of the missing person inspector lefevre said
7434459 the question for me is not so much whether st marys should be closed down but whether st marys will close itself down by practices that separate it from communion with the roman catholic church
7434460 nevertheless only extreme recklessness would place a buddhist statue in a christian church
7434461 no matter where that takes place there is every possibility it would arouse angry feelings particularly with christians from different religious cultures
7434462 but its own style of worship and sacramental practice can hardly be described as roman catholic
7434463 as such it is out of communion with the roman catholic archdiocese of brisbane and universal roman catholic church under the leadership of the bishop of rome
7434464 im not particularly hopeful myself but its up to the community they will find the right solution
7434465 we have been actively engaged in this since the news of this kidnapping occurred
7434466 we have deployed additional staff from our mission in pretoria to our high commission in nairobi which is handling this case at a consular level
7434467 the dfat consular officials are providing consular assistance to the family in australia which have asked im simply referring to their request have asked the media to respect their privacy at this difficult time

7434493 we did have a sense from the little information we have that there was some mistreatment
7434494 that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7434495 we have arrested malik and his supporters have peacefully dispersed after his arrest
7434496 what you call the routine drill of keeping these gentlemen under house arrest where they freely received guests and visitors who would be shown in by armed guards provided by the government has been broken now
7434497 sagt wolf der prozess kann 30 minuten ben tigen obwohl wolf sagt ihm sei erkl rt worden dass apple an verbesserungen arbeite die das verfahren auf ungef hr 15 minuten verringern k nnten
7434498 i guess thats the fun of making a story theres definitely some messages i want to get across
7434499 it gives the kids sort of a metaphor to overcome
7434500 its kind of like the frustration we got going into the county commissioners last summer saying please dont cut our funding
7434501 any kind of education is important especially because you wouldnt expect it in a stairwell
7434502 its the type of hit that occurs once or twice a year around the world
7434503 i have guys i have to take care of right now
7434504 we have to take care of the gfeller family and their wishes too but we have a football team i have to take care of and seven other coaches and we have to get ourselves back together and be able to get through this
7434505 were dealing not only with our own grief but with how to help our own kids
7434506 i dont know how you could ever really prepare for something like this you never go to a high school football game or any sporting event and think youll end up at baptist hospital praying for your sons life
7434507 i knew matt and his family from back when i was in elementary school i never imagined this tragedy to happen to him i know everyone family friends and strangers that are grieving over this loss keep him and his family in your prayers
7434508 as the athletic trainer at reynolds high i only met matt a couple times he was a very hard worker you could tell he had true love for the game if there are any reynolds players or any football players that need a shoulder to lean on i am here for you to the gfeller family thank you for all you do reynolds high just gained an angel
7434509 i am truly saddened and truly sorry for your loss its hard to move on and its hard to concentrate now because a young mans life was taken away on sunday august 24th 2008 i will be praying for the gfeller family r i p matt
7434510 die anwendung f hlt sich gut an und man kann auch allerhand damit machen
7434511 i think you are starting off with a good base of users
7434512 build a base of local merchants who are unique and who can co exist with friendly center
7434513 i was primarily impressed with the general agreement that the city and other organizations need to pay more attention to retail
7434514 in a tournament like this winning one match would be an accomplishment
7434515 i dont have a goal of saying i want to make certain rounds if i win the first match i know no matter how i play in the first match im going to play better in the second
7434516 what happened to him last summer was a matter of momentum confidence and luck
7434517 nobody basically goes from zero to the top 100 in a couple months he jumped two levels without learning the process that goes along with pro tennis amp ellipses so really its almost like hes starting over and hes starting at such a good point
7434518 ive been working on things that i need to implement in my match even if its uncomfortable to me like serve and volleying on first and second serves the whole practice hitting backhand returns and coming to the net its all stuff so i feel more comfortable during the match
7434519 coming in blind as a coach youre trying to evaluate and assess how to help somebody be a better tennis player
7434520 it was trying to get him to hit bigger forehands hit more consistent hit heavier balls and be more offensive on the backhand
7434521 i was disappointed but i think i had done everything i knew to do
7434522 he has shown a lot of interest in good issues frye says
7434523 and i think what he did has helped to get other lawyers to do the same its hard to get people to take death penalty cases
7434524 everyone was happy to see me and talk with me as long as i wanted to talk
7434525 they were as cordial and polite as anyone in that position could be
7434526 he told me he accepted his fate but insisted he didnt do it
7434527 if my client had been a fortune 500 company and cowan has represented such companies my fee would have been 400 000 or 500 000
7434528 a lot of lawyers feel their pro bono responsibility is part of being a lawyer he says
7434529 there are lots of lawyers who have done this more than i have nothing i did was unusual
7434530 we have plenty of time to sort through it but they need some time off
7434531 i think theres only one dream team in my opinion
7434532 theres teams that could be close to it but not like that one that team changed a lot of things in basketball and made a lot of young players want to play basketball and want to dedicate themselves to the sport
7434533 i think this team is really very good and played at a very very high level all tournament and theyre close to that team but now i think theres nothing like that
7434534 he gave us such an emotional speech and it moved us all
7434535 we all suffered the pain that he felt when he lost and we wanted to share this with him
7434536 well race him like that in the chase if thats the way he wants to race busch said upon finishing second to edwards
7434537 lets make it real clear im not apologizing for it he said
7434538 it just cost him more than it cost me at the time thats the way it is
7434539 just smoked the back bumper of my car and knocked edwards out of the way as they raced for position
7434540 you reap what you sow edwards said gibbs told him
7434541 i explained to him thats why that happened that way edwards said
7434542 if museveni gives me a job that i feel would provide me with a platform to promoting democracy i would do it and do it well
7434543 i want to do something about our society and i dont want to wait many years when ra reform agenda is in power i want to begin now
7434544 museveni has been wooing me since feb 2001 he has offered me a ministerial post before and as i told you he has left the door open for me to work with him
7434545 i am thinking that i will initiate a meeting with museveni and tell him that i have decided to work with him but only in the capacity that i think will be useful impactful and make a difference
7434546 i will also tell him that i am not looking for a job because i have a good job which i enjoy doing but that i feel as a calling to participate in spearheading the tourism industry as the one that will drive this country out of poverty
7434547 i will remind him that i declined his jobs before because i only do a job that i want to do and feel i can do well not just any posting
7434548 i will also tell him that i will do this on condition that i remain an active member of ra and that i should not be expected to defect
7434549 anne i plan to go it this way and that is the only job i want to do for the reasons i have enumerated already but i can only do it in musevenis govt because i need the policy and the budget to do it
7434550 i would like to ask a favour of you that if you plan to warn our people let me know so i know how to behave with them but for the moment let us keep all this among us three
7434551 as a minister i would get probably the same salary may be slightly less and unlimited fuel airtime etc so there would not be enough motivation to bribe me but as minister i get access to international platform
7434552 i can reach presidents of countries and world banks and parliaments
7434553 anne you must be near fainting but am tired of this small time non progressive strategy am a business person by training and occupation and if one way does not work i quickly go back to the drawing board
7434554 dr besigye and anne you are probably going to copy this email to our people and warn them to be careful about and around me but dont just trust me i am thinking about so many options to move the revolution
7434555 well on beti my approach is not to be offensive let us see where she is going and let people also see where she is going
7434556 i dont recall all the emails but we did have some discussion
7434557 i had a long chat with them but do the details look genuine
7434558 these confrontations are taking us nowhere and that is why we have decided to write to our party chairman mr museveni such that he talks peace with some of our colleagues before it is too late
7434559 those people in parliament like henry banyenzaki theodore ssekikubo sometimes emmanuel dombo and sometimes sam lyomoki i will fight you like i fought kony
7434560 i have always longed for an opportunity to explain my issues to the president because some people have always deceived him that i am always against party positions yet this is not true
7434561 if it is to force us to glorify what is wrong as right
7434562 if this meeting is to strengthen methods of work within and outside the party then it is a welcome move and our party will continue to be strong because as of now there is something wrong and we need to talk as members of one family to sort out what has gone wrong
7434563 the assembly on saturday tomorrow will mainly focus on issues that will help ugandas football and its good that also the delegates have since moved from the previous talks that used to dominate the previous assemblies
7434564 mzee kenyatta left a rich legacy in which he kept exhorting kenyans to shun violence exploitation greed corruption and strive to build a strong country devoid of tribalism and hatred
7434565 our leaders should be in the forefront in ensuring that these ideals are nurtured at all times
7434566 during this period the country had been hit by severe drought resulting in widespread hunger which forced the government to import yellow maize from the us
7434567 any attempt to derail the enactment of a new constitution is a direct challenge to the continued survival of our nationhood
7434568 we should leave the matter to a panel of experts to build consensus on the remaining contentious issues and move on
7434569 the national accord is testimony to the will and spirit of the people of kenya to find solutions to difficult problems we need this spirit even more at this constitution making moment
7434570 this is an opportunity that kenyans can ignore at their own peril
7434571 patient x the sample in the green top test tube of blood is hemolyzed red blood cells are ruptured we need another one sent
7434572 lab called that samples hemolyzed can you send another one
7434573 we strongly believe that it doesnt matter who you vote for as long as you vote
7434574 getting to rerecord a classic song like this was a real honor for us and we hope it helps inspire people to vote
7434575 if for example someone wants to encourage an ordinance that goats be allowed in the backyard
7434576 its going to hurt tonight and hurt tomorrow but as the months go on theyre going to realize what a huge deal this is
7434577 the international federation has required the delivery of birth certificates and all the documents like family books entries in schools and things like that
7434578 they have received the documents and at first sight it seems to be ok
7434579 she said you won you won you won nothing else to say there just listening to each other smile on the phone
7434580 i think as a team we showcased what we can do throughout the whole season
7434581 when im out of there or im in there you really cant tell
7434582 the only thing that changes is the jersey number 28 and 34 you know it keeps the defense on their heels not only in the running game but in the passing game as well
7434583 without a doubt and when you have two guys that can run like they can thats better for their bodies over the course of a season
7434584 weve wanted to be able to run the ball for some time
7434585 a positive mental attitude is the starting point of all riches whether they be riches of a material nature or intangible riches
7434586 its the action behind the attraction that makes the dream come true

7434590 we are pleased that pdvsa has shown confidence in scan geophysical by awarding us this contract the largest to date for our company
7434591 keeping our 3d vessel working in this region for a major company is consistent with our overall strategy to maintain vessel presence in the americas and to work directly for operating entities
7434592 when the first night of ramadan comes the devils and rebellious jinns are put in chains and the doors of hell are closed none of them remains open the doors of heaven are open and none of them remains closed and a caller calls o seeker of goodness come forward and o seeker of evil desist and allah has many in this month who will be freed from hell this announcement is made every night
7434593 whosoever fasts in ramadan with faith and seeking allahs reward all his past sins are forgiven
7434594 whosoever does not leave bad words and bad actions allah does not care if he leaves his food and drink
7434595 when you fast anoint yourself let not the signs of fast be seen on you
7434596 o people a great and a blessed month is approaching you in this month there is a night that is better than one thousand months allah has made fasting obligatory and prayers at night commendable during this month whosoever will do a voluntary good deed during this month it is as if he performed an obligatory good deed at another time and whosoever will perform an obligatory good deed it is as if he performed seventy obligatory good deeds at another time this is the month of patience and the reward of patience is paradise this is the month of kindness in this month the believers provision is increased whosoever will give food to a fasting person in this month it will bring forgiveness for his sins will save him from the hellfire and he shall have his reward while the fasting person will not lose any of his reward

7434598 it was all very civilised unlike previous visits i have had from police
7434599 the allegation is that he went around to a property there was an argument i understand there were alleged threats
7434600 if it had occurred they would have plucked him straight away he said
7434601 las comparaciones son indignantes inaceptables y groseramente discriminatorias todo al mismo tiempo

7434609 anyone having link with this organization promoting its literature and message helping it financially or in any other way will be taken to task according to the law
7434610 i am sure the russians have left other surprises for us
7434611 they want to disrupt our life and our economy as much as possible
7434612 its been quiet where i was for the past two weeks but now i am worried even though i am happy to be back
7434613 i am afraid that what happened here with the russians will happen again
7434614 the situation in the black sea is tending to become more tense
7434615 nato countries are building up their naval presence to deliver humanitarian aid i do not think that this will contribute to the stabilization of the situation in the region

7434619 the accident happened on a hill near this village when the tg jes flight crashed for unknown reasons according to preliminary information at least 14 people were aboard
7434620 the airplane did not explode on landing but later spilled fuel on the ground caught fire otherwise nobody would have survived
7434621 one source referred chillingly to the well known chinese phrase of settling accounts after autumn harvest qiu hou suan zhang
7434622 reinforce the public safety system and create a better environment for economic and social development
7434623 is a surveillance system to monitor the tibetans and the temples in the entire ganzi region
7434624 one source referred chillingly to the well known chinese phrase of settling accounts after autumn harvest qiu hou suan zhang
7434625 it has been limited in the past to monasteries patriotic education largely took place in the monasteries but now it is more widespread to include lay tibetans nomads farmers and even government workers and there is no doubt there has been an increase in that since the trouble in march

7434635 janssens product risperdal received a preferential recommendation as a medication of choice on the project algorithms used to treat children and adolescents

7434637 no campaign ive been involved with has invested this many resources into training volunteers
7434638 it shows that obama is really committed to grassroots campaigning
7434639 obama is picking someone based on qualifications competence and ability to govern and not on state electoral votes
7434640 his narrative of personal struggle and hard work should appeal to any voter
7434641 his background and qualifications give him a strong national appeal
7434642 i think were going to make inroads in all our states
7434643 the texas state republican party is confident that mccain will win texas and were trying to focus our efforts where we can make a difference
7434644 it forces them by necessity to make certain career choices that they might otherwise not want to make
7434645 it wont make it impossible for them to be able to get credit in the future it might make it harder for them to purchase a home and get the best mortgage because they might not be able to come up with a down payment
7434646 college students are a wonderful consumer base for credit card companies because in four to six or whatever years in theory these borrowers will in fact have jobs credit card companies are willing to risk some amount of default from those students
7434647 the way they mostly make money now is from late fees and penalties and interest
7434648 both parties are optimistic that a mutually acceptable resolution will be achieved shortly
7434649 were trying to resolve it and thats where our efforts are now
7434650 we need to provide renewable fuel not just when the wind blows or when the sun shines
7434651 they are making the issue bigger than it is and actually submitting the students to possibly increased violence
7434652 the superintendent used the term common sense when the school board made its decision but its just the opposite
7434653 we dont know what is going to happen right now but we dont think it will come to a strike
7434654 we cant predict anything and we wont have advanced notice if and when the strike occurs
7434655 the house appealed to me for two reasons one it was eco friendly and two it was built by a fantastic program that helps the community
7434656 youthworks tries to see that those students dont fall through the cracks
7434657 i cant say im looking forward to the best mans speech he has a long list of things hes not allowed to talk about but im sure there will be something about the rosie storyline ill have to grin and bear it
7434658 i hope i dont have a swollen face for the wedding corrie make up department and make sure the bruises are covered up for the pictures ive found out jennie has a very good right hook
7434659 at the heart of the whole story are these two people who love each other very much but too many things get in their way
7434660 its not going to be them back together all nice and happy there will be quite a few bridges to cross
7434661 getting the call was a real rush lots of excitement but we were nervous
7434662 some of them seemed a little scared when we rolled out there but its my job to take care of them and make sure they dont get hurt
7434663 i never thought id ever be a firefighter its such a great feeling being out there and doing a good job people saying thanks its a good feeling

7434665 its definitely something ill look at doing when i get out

7434668 when we do our initial interviews we find people who are trainable and we can mold into firefighters
7434669 thats one of our talks we have with the inmate team they are held to a higher standard in the facility and held to a higher standard to the other inmates
7434670 i was dead serious about it it was my career
7434671 i dont want to go back to where i was im just ready to make my parents proud
7434672 i saw that and thought oh my god thats kentson i knew it was him
7434673 i was so proud i called everybody ive printed if off and e mailed it to everyone i know
7434674 i could tell he was changed i could hear it in his voice he already had goals i knew that he was focused on not wanting to ever go back to prison
7434675 at first it was because it would get me out of prison faster i knew it would get me into shape too now im moving up im a squad leader in training its more responsibility and a little more money
7434676 he followed instructions well you could tell him one time and he would follow those instructions he was always asking questions
7434677 im so proud of him he has goals and i hope he sticks with firefighting when he gets out
7434678 they contact me all the time and that feels great
7434679 what were trying to do is get them trained to show up on time hold a job and do the job correctly
7434680 its all about motivation all people are different with our program were trying to get them to think differently than they have in the past thats the hard part
7434681 i practiced a lot in trinidad i was really out of shape
7434682 there was a track there and id go out there and run and run until i couldnt run anymore
7434683 two seconds i made it with 2 seconds to spare
7434684 for me firefighting is a new skill a new trade
7434685 i was really depressed for the first six months but when i came to rifle things got better
7434686 if you got to be in prison this is the place to be
7434687 im so comfortable here im just trying to work on my future
7434688 i think if he was still out there doing that stuff he would be dead
7434689 i think the no 1 thing that spells frustration anxiety knots in your stomach are all the things that go along with an injury to the players which do not allow your team to function as it is presented on paper
7434690 all those types of things are very difficult for coaches no matter what age you are
7434691 after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure
7434692 i tried to talk to the coaches about it and i assured the coaches that we will have to be at our best because our team will know before they come in here today because we have to do a great job of getting our players refocused
7434693 i have heard it said four months but again probably each individual is somewhat different the doctors have told me that this will be a four month recovery
7434694 you know what someone has already raised that today and i havent really talked to anyone at this point in time about anything to be honest with you
7434695 i am sure that general manager jerry reese and i and ownership will look long and hard at whatever options are out there and do what is best here at this point in time
7434696 i dont have a whole lot of comment about it the only thing i have talked to michael about is his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment with fox and he was very excited about that
7434697 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox
7434698 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig
7434699 i have not had a chance to talk to anyone
7434700 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7434701 sexually deficient in some way according the study of 20 000 australians by public health researchers at the
7434702 our findings support the idea that bondage and discipline and sadomasochism bdsm is simply a sexual interest or subculture attractive to a minority associate professor juliet richters and her colleagues wrote in the
7434703 however they were no more likely to have been coerced into sexual activity and were not significantly more likely to be unhappy or anxious said prof richters author of the book
7434704 people with these sexual interests have long been seen by medicine and the law as at best damaged and in need of therapy and at worst dangerous and in need of legal regulation she said
7434705 and need particularly strong stimuli such as being beaten or tied up to become aroused
7434706 we have four really good receivers on this team and we have a quarterback we like a veteran quarterback and were developing another
7434707 so that part i think were going to be fine but weve got to keep the hounds off him kitna
7434708 it was a panic thing because me and the receiver werent on the same page
7434709 it was just the cardinal sin dont throw it right over the middle
7434710 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7434711 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7434712 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7434713 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7434714 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox
7434715 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig
7434716 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7434717 we always knew it would be close its always difficult to beat an incumbent
7434718 shaheen spent 700 000 this summer and didnt move her numbers at all
7434719 the clinton people are all with us but we need more from the obama side to win this
7434720 getting the call was a real rush lots of excitement but we were nervous
7434721 some of them seemed a little scared when we rolled out there but its my job to take care of them and make sure they dont get hurt
7434722 i never thought id ever be a firefighter its such a great feeling being out there and doing a good job people saying thanks its a good feeling
7434723 ive never had a feeling like that before i cant say that ive ever done anything real positive with my life before that
7434724 its definitely something ill look at doing when i get out
7434725 were known as hard workers theres never been any negativity its always been good feedback
7434726 a lot of times civilians dont even know that were a prison crew
7434727 when we do our initial interviews we find people who are trainable and we can mold into firefighters
7434728 thats one of our talks we have with the inmate team they are held to a higher standard in the facility and held to a higher standard to the other inmates
7434729 i was dead serious about it it was my career
7434730 i dont want to go back to where i was im just ready to make my parents proud
7434731 i saw that and thought oh my god thats kentson i knew it was him
7434732 i was so proud i called everybody ive printed if off and e mailed it to everyone i know
7434733 i could tell he was changed i could hear it in his voice he already had goals i knew that he was focused on not wanting to ever go back to prison
7434734 at first it was because it would get me out of prison faster i knew it would get me into shape too now im moving up im a squad leader in training its more responsibility and a little more money

7434748 les autorit s chinoises nous ont inform s la nuit derni re que huit personnes arr t es les 20 et 21 ao t ont t expuls es

7434751 the population of georgia will feel more safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7434752 were tired of fay and glad it looks like shes gone
7434753 may be too closely aligned with people who hold radical political views
7434754 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people
7434755 of course its possible to prepare a forecast with any lead time you like whether or nor that forecast has any accuracy or usable skill is another question
7434756 this man is suspected of being involved in one of the most heinous mass killings in recent times
7434757 its an area known for avalanches it the ice regularly breaks off here
7434758 they were in the trail but problem was that the avalanche swept away the trail
7434759 the guide shouted run fast run fast it didnt make any noise it really was impressive
7434760 we had just enough time to move away to the right before getting hit we were really lucky
7434761 from the moment we could locate them with radar echo and surface analyses it was already five hours after the avalanche so theres no more hope
7434762 they skidded between 1 000 and 1 500 meters yards
7434763 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue
7434764 must control skyrocketing health care costs in order to remain competitive and protect jobs
7434765 she is still not quite clean but she was dangerous running up and down the flank and she is going to be a handful for anybody we play
7434766 goodson started off with a great strike and then lisberger has shown that when she comes in the game she changes the game
7434767 i didnt play as well as i would have liked but you cant really ask for more than two goals
7434768 it was great to have a chance to give back especially to the kids and the fans
7434769 it makes us feel good to get out here and being able to play in our jerseys with a new team i am pumped up
7434770 i wanted to see execution from the scrimmage we are still a work in progress but we will continue to work
7434771 it was our first time out with our freshmen first time as a new team first time with the uniforms and the crowd so there were a bit of nerves but we will get better as the year goes on
7434772 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7434773 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7434774 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7434775 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7434776 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7434777 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7434778 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7434779 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7434780 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7434781 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7434782 i got stymied behind the tree and i got lucky because i got a drop because of some gopher holes or whatever it was
7434783 it wasnt where my ball was but like about 5 or 6 feet left it was actually moving you could see the grass going up and down it was actually there and we were trying to find it but we couldnt
7434784 i just wanted to know why he got a drop there was obviously a mole there and he was burrowing at that moment you could see him popping out i was really focused on what i was doing
7434785 were wearing aprons but everybody whos here the agents the editors the faculty the fellows the other contributors knows that this person whos waiting on you is going to be a very important writer in four or five years
7434786 so for us its kind of amazing and i think for everybody its kind of amazing
7434787 hes not dane cook hes got a more sophisticated everyday take on things he often comes across as a questioner of conventional wisdom but also can be kind of a crank its a fine line to walk when youre dealing with a younger person
7434788 i knew the plants were versatile so when i started cleaning out the grove i had piles of branches and i was trying to figure out what can i do with this wood
7434789 i discovered that the branches are hollow between the joints and decided to make beads and jewelry out of them
7434790 for hot sauce lovers its definitely a tradition people get hyped up and ramped up about it
7434791 you kind of get bragging rights if you win to be able to win with that many contestants is pretty impressive
7434792 theres hot sauce all over the place so to be able to stand out is a pretty big deal
7434793 i tend to lean toward salsas that have great flavor no matter how hot they are
7434794 sometimes youll run across a salsa thats trying too hard to be hot but doesnt have any real flavor to back it up but at the same time if something makes the sweat pop off my brow im all over it

7434796 most people dont know the resources that abound here in tucson for public outreach and education
7434797 they can see its not a huge problem some have even gone out on activities on tours or sand biking
7434798 but obamas newness and message of change can take people out of their comfort level biden gives people a little bit more of a comfort back
7434799 he isnt going to be throwing the bomb on every play
7434800 the reality of it is there was no perfect choice
7434801 there are issues involved with foreign policy and obamas experience that biden covers
7434802 the fact of the matter is we dont know what any of them are going to do until they get in office
7434803 do you select as your surgeon someone who just got out of medical school or someone who has been doing it for 20 years
7434804 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7434805 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7434806 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7434807 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7434808 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7434809 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7434810 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7434811 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7434812 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7434813 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7434814 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7434815 the capture of abu tiba and abu othman eliminates two of the few remaining experienced leaders in the aqi network
7434816 why did brines go to the bother of getting his rule book out if he wasnt simply looking for a way of getting john he is allowed into the dressing room
7434817 in spite of economic constraints in some markets like the united states on a worldwide basis servers continued to grow in the second quarter of the year
7434818 this coupled with web data center build outs and growth in emerging markets produced solid q2 results
7434819 cios have to align it with their corporate strategy to get higher returns
7434820 i guess you could think of it as poetic justice in a way
7434821 its someone who is literally paying the price for having committed a crime
7434822 its not anyones tax dollars and it ought to be preserved for the purposes for which it was originally intended
7434823 we dont anticipate large scale raids here in our district because we dont really have the industry known for hiring illegal immigrants that suggests this sort of thing will happen here
7434824 but we do want to support principals in cases where the legal guardian has been detained and deported
7434825 i had two little girls of my own but was only able to watch we never train for delivering a baby
7434826 i saw it was now or never and told her she was going to have to start pushing
7434827 this way students are reusing the items and getting the most out of what would otherwise be trash
7434828 i think its important to support student organizations at ut and help the environment at the same time
7434829 all the money we raise goes right back into the center and our programs
7434830 its cheaper than buying retail and students use alternative ways to help the environment
7434831 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door
7434832 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7434833 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7434834 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7434835 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7434836 the population of georgia will feel more safe from today from the russian aggression
7434837 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7434838 there clearly is a little more sternness in the warning coming out from epa and thats ok
7434839 sure there will be some people who will think twice and three times before they do it
7434840 in this country everyone talks about becoming energy independent not having to rely on foreign sources of oil but it seems as though every time there is a push to make something work there is someone out there trying to beat it back
7434841 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
7434842 has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
7434843 has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite u s presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality while sen mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
7434844 were monitoring closely and will have something to say when an agreement is finalized
7434845 at this point obama looks a little less reckless than he might have a few months ago
7434846 i dont think this gets the issue off the table
7434847 between now and election day not a lot of troops are going to come home
7434848 has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
7434849 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
7434850 people are afraid for their children and are too scared to go to work in case they come home and find all their belongings stolen

7434854 their intentions may have been good but we tell everyone that they shouldnt take the law into their own hands because it will cause more problems for everyone in the long run

7434860 a hot oven or a hot car its the same thing
7434861 if they think a patient will gain an extra year of life but it will cost more than 20 000 they think it is not cost effective yet if the patient wants to pay for it themselves they are denied nhs treatment its an outrage
7434862 the nhs was built on the foundation of caring for the community it was designed to help those who needed help care for those who needed care and treat those who needed treatment
7434863 those basic principals have been lost as the government takes us down a dangerous path that can only be a catastrophic meltdown of the system
7434864 ten years ago waits of 18 months were not uncommon but by the end of this year no one should wait longer than 18 weeks none of this would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of everyone working into he nhs

7434882 its the radiocarbon date that to our minds is like a square peg in a round hole its not fitting properly and the question is why
7434883 there is a lot of other evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed

7434888 dismissed the long spanish mexican tenure in the region as a time of despotism religious intolerance and economic stagnation
7434889 earlier the casualty ward received between 100 to 150 patients only today the number has increased to 800 the challenge is greater but resources insufficient
7434890 i had always been passionate about giving something back to my society which is why i chose to do medicine when i joined as a medical officer in 1989 and witnessed the poor condition of state run hospitals i decided to work towards a change i wanted to uplift the ward i was given charge of and prove that the government sector can also deliver if provided with the funds and opportunity this i was able to do over the years
7434891 the emergency ward at the jpmc karachi is possibly the only ward in the country where doctors are constantly busy if there is no political clash or bomb blast we are dealing with deaths from epidemics rain and what not
7434892 there were about 250 injured brought to the hospital and the chaos was unimaginable
7434893 in an urban city like karachi where suicide bombings clashes and political killings are common it is difficult to remain stress free but with time we learnt to handle one difficult situation after another
7434894 my official timings are from 8 00 am to 2 00 pm but i never return home on time and am unable to have lunch with my children it would always take me another three hours to wrap up
7434895 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7434896 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7434897 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7434898 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7434899 we have provided daleks and components for the tardis in the past and i think a one off move to the big screen would be amazing
7434900 it would take doctor who to the next level the show has a worldwide appeal so should be very successful
7434901 i think david tenant is an excellent doctor who is perfect for the part because he is eccentric and a nice guy too
7434902 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7434903 that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7434904 for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7434905 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40
7434906 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7434907 i knew that there would definitely be an end to donna at the end of the series
7434908 but had that not been the case had it been open ended had there been potential for donna to stay for another series i must confess that id have said yes like a shot

7434930 basically eight months ago i was diagnosed with panic attacks
7434931 its something i have been trying to deal with i am trying to keep my head clear
7434932 when i first got there to colorado i couldnt eat or sleep
7434933 i just didnt want to be there i struggled during camp with panic attacks and my conditioning wasnt there that karo that used to come out tenacious was not there
7434934 i asked to fight him yoshida because he is a judo guy
7434935 i saw how he threw war machine he toyed with him before putting him to sleep i knew i wanted to fight yoshida after seeing that
7434936 i dont mean this disrespectfully toward my past opponents but its the first time i am fighting a guy with a national sports background
7434937 i dont know if i can throw him or if he can throw me
7434938 but mma is a whole new ballgame for him yoshida the whole game changes when you can throw punches and kicks
7434939 i know that i want to close the gap and go into the clinch i want him to respect my standup i want to do a brilliant judo throw and put him on his head from there i want to land punches ground and pound or even submit him i just want to prove that i am the judo guy in the ufc not him

7434944 she was heavily criticised for the coverage given to the famous crimen de alc cer making a live broadcast from this village the same night that the bodies of the girls were found in the programme they took advantage of the emotional state of the families of the victims interviewing the parents about how they felt at the time and converting their pain into a public spectacle to be broadcast to the whole country
7434945 if something that bad happened in my life it would probably give me the shake up i need to change things dramatically forever and kick me out of the everlasting everyday mundane
7434946 some people need to go home so one boat is going to return
7434947 others are going to stay here for a month but overall were trying to create an ongoing ferry service that brings in people and supplies from cyprus to gaza this is not a one time attempt
7434948 they are going to take 10 palestinian students with them
7434949 the idea is to get them out of gaza to cyprus and then off to universities elsewhere
7434950 it was political the point was to break the siege and change israeli policy in gaza it wasnt a one time thing we are going to continue bringing boats into gaza and those will have humanitarian assistance on board
7434951 they let these two boats in so i dont see why they wouldnt let a third one in
7434952 were trying to open gaza up to the outside world in an additional gesture of solidarity with the residents of gaza some 25 of the humanitarian volunteers are scheduled to go out to sea with gaza fishermen on monday
7434953 there is no change in israeli policy and there is no need for the port since the palestinians are getting everything they need via the land based crossings

7434971 we have couple of plans and we hope that our players would be playing some international cricket next month
7434972 at least we did not lose the hosting right and in the present circumstances i think it was the right decision to delay the tournament for one year
7434973 our findings suggest that a modest exercise program is an effective robust treatment for depressed patients who are inclined to participate in it
7434974 the benefits of exercise are likely to endure particularly among those who adopt it as a regular ongoing life activity
7434975 they can see its not a huge problem some have even gone out on activities on tours or sand biking

7434977 during the time of the original streetcar it went everywhere worth going
7434978 it gave phoenix a very modern future looking system of public transportation
7434979 phoenix viewed the trolley system as making it a modern city
7434980 the trolley lines and the city grew at the same time and in the same direction
7434981 it pretty much went everywhere phoenixs population wanted to go and resided
7434982 you could get a flat wheel real easy if you stopped too fast
7434983 i think a great part of the reason the streetcar system ceased to operate was the automobile
7434984 even if the trolley had survived the fire of 1947 it would have been unable to keep up with the sprawling development of phoenix like automobile transportation

7434988 i ask my grandfather sometimes to tell me your stories
7434989 individuals in order to understand themselves need knowledge and information about those who came before them especially grandparents
7434990 we inherit a culture at home and that culture comes to us from our parents mostly and their culture came from their parents theres this domestic culture in every family
7434991 my dad told me all about being in the navy the segregation being the cook
7434992 its pictures that have the power to bring kids in
7434993 i had the problem thinking i had to start at the beginning tell everything step by step
7434994 that will kill you youll never get it when the thoughts occur to you theyre fresh and you can put an interesting piece together its not so much building the story
7434995 it looks like we will have one more day of this
7434996 were still expecting some rain monday morning but the peak chance will be in the afternoon
7434997 the main cause is an upper level low over northern mexico thats pulling moisture in from the gulf
7434998 the upper level low is moving off to the west so the heaviest activity should be about done
7434999 the middle and end of august starts our rainy season and its not unusual to get heavy rainfall at this time

7435001 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7435002 a prejudiced decision that because he was asian because he was chinese he would do the meek and mild thing
7435003 well shawn tan actually knows about standing up for himself and the act party supports every new zealander for their rights
7435004 the idea that you can pick someone off like this and actually pick them off because you think they are chinese and will just go quietly and wont stand up for themselves i tell you that is not the new zealand we support
7435005 there are still new zealanders who make decisions on the basis of superficial things like race and colour and that is something i would have expected the epmu to feel strongly about

7435011 press conference rooms at the olympic venues usually are formal settings last week at the yingdong natatorium something changed after the dutch womens water polo team upset the united states 9 8 to win the gold medal while talking to a dutch reporter coach robin van galen began taking off his pants we could report what he wore underneath but that definitely is tmi van galen was wet after taking the traditional victory dunk but the undressing on the podium left a group of chinese female volunteers in a state of disbelief perhaps this is what the international olympic committee means when it talks about cultural sharing
7435012 my dear swiss friend andrea has insisted i pay attention to her beloved roger federer watching the once invincible tennis player slice through opponents with professional coolness gave me a certain perception not quite robotic but machine like then came his olympic doubles match with partner stanislas wawrinka when they had dispatched their swedish rivals to win the gold medal federer bounded around the court like a child he hugged wawrinka and soon they were rolling around the court i asked federer to compare his emotionless victories in the grand slams with his passionate display after winning an olympic doubles title i cant hug a stranger when i win in singles he said
7435013 ini adalah debut dan saya melakukannya dengan sebuah kesalahan wasit pun mengusir saya tapi inilah sepakbola satu yang terpenting saya sangat takjub melihat kekuatan tim ini hanya sembilan pemain tapi kami bisa menang robben tampil sangat bagus di babak kedua dia merubah jalannya pertandingan

7435016 am fost surprins ca toata lumea se focusa pe real estate si ignora sectoarele productive care au perspective pe termen lung si care vor sustine cresterea economica orientandu se pe real estate investitorii pierdeau foarte multe oportunitati acum se pare ca multi dintre oamenii care au facut bani din real estate ii redirectioneaza catre alte domenii
7435017 primele semne ale incetinirii din real estate au aparut anul trecut in polonia apoi acestea s au transferat in romania in 2008 pe masura globalizarii aceste fenomene sunt precum un val mai devreme sau mai tarziu vor ajunge si vor avea impact in toate economiile

7435033 the former world champion knew this would be his last olympics and was determined to bring home the gold for his country in athens four years ago he lost in early rounds to cubas yuriorkis gamboa which led him to believe his time as a competitive boxer was over
7435034 however the thai story at the games is as ever about far more than the medals won it is instead about the stories of thai officials allegedly trying to sell the country by lobbying officials to make sure thai boxers lose their fights endless controversies concerning whether the right results were determined in points scoring events stories of nuns monks orphans and changes of name to change luck and destiny
7435035 anyway despite malaysia ranked 75 on the medal tally i am still happy and proud that at least we won something
7435036 gold is expensive so china can only afford to give us silver
7435037 i will not go into debate about the degree of singaporean ness these table tennis athletes are as far as i am concerned and in the eyes of the olympic competition they are singaporeans this mighty olympic medal winning achievement is a singaporean record worth celebrating
7435038 limited resources such as lao training facilities in a pool half the size of a standard olympic size swimming pool influence her results within those limits her achievements are great
7435039 the cambodian team candidates were receiving only 30 usd per month from our national olympic committee of cambodia nocc while training for the competition i wonder how can they survive with such a little stipend if they really invest their heart and soul into the game and i wonder how much will nocc has been putting to support our cambodian team
7435040 i say that the thing about brunei not being able to compete is a funny thing they really take last minute planning to the real last minute for those of you who dont know what happened brunei was excluded from the games because they failed to register their athletes on time it was only on opening day itself they decided to try hard to submit their registry
7435041 after the beijing olympics the philippines now holds the all time record for the most number of medals in the games without a gold
7435042 philippines you disappoint me on beijing olympics and thanks for wasting my day and time
7435043 this morning i saw the awarding ceremony for wushu and the philippine national anthem being played for the first time in the beijing olympics i was emotional and proud of willy wang our only gold medalist in this years olympics
7435044 i do hope that wushu becomes an official olympic sport because pinoy athletes are one of the best in that sport i guess we just have to wait for the 2016 olympics because i just read online that the 2012 london games didnt consider wushu it even scrapped baseball and softball
7435045 i do wish that our philippine sports officials will set their priorities funds should be given to sports associations that would enable pinoys to get gold medals in the olympics
7435046 athletes have been smashing records at beijing olympics much to our awe and amusement whether they are beating the world or olympic records set in the recent olympic games or world championships or a world record unbeaten for more than decade already they are sure pumping more energy in this olympiad sports science is definitely far more developed this century and new techniques have been applied in the athletes training programs the worlds athletes simply performed very well in beijing the idea of the olympic games anyway is all about conquering human ability the evolution of men has simply not yet stopped

7435051 from a professional point of view i have to say that it is not conclusive you cant take a preliminary medical report and say it is conclusive
7435052 we also want to talk to the doctor but he seems to be uncontactable
7435053 i advise the public not to jump to conclusion or assumption on this matter based on the flyer to make a conclusive medical report one must have the experience and expertise in handling such cases whether the report is true or otherwise just let the court decide

7435074 by the time you get to your late 20s and early 30s youre going to have some damage if theres been enormous wear and tear on these systems
7435075 what social support does is it keeps those responses low so the cumulative damage is less

7435088 one of the citys two open air celebrations of sadomasochism euphemistically called the leather lifestyle by practitioners

7435090 ill go even further and call the images depraved and disgusting
7435091 remember this is on the public streets of san francisco
7435092 these photos do not fit in with the slick national gay marketing plan to be sure
7435093 nevertheless the pathetic and debased spectacle is as much an offspring of the glbt movement as the current quest for homosexual marriage the latter radically redefines and corrupts an ancient institution created by god to order relations between man and woman as the basis for family life perverse events like up your alley mock any notion of right and wrong as the reckless pursuit of anything goes tolerance leads governmental authorities to enable and promote evil turning freedom into sexual anarchy while causing a breakdown in law and order

7435096 homosexual activists mock and deride americans for truth relentlessly for exposing sordid realities like up your alley and showing you what happens when sexual radicals come to dominate a major city
7435097 they dont want americans to see this side of their agenda but we must face reality and come to grips with the truth that rights based on aberrant sex are not genuine civil rights
7435098 like the pantless perverts wandering around in sneakers only at up your alley the liberals pro homosexual tolerance and diversity program is now fully exposed as a soulless and bankrupt ideology

7435118 at previous conventions the parties and candidates would hope that the video would be shown to the television audience and if you were at home watching you might see it said andrew rasiej co founder of

7435130 i dont know if gary is ever going to get time to adapt to this role but you know what we have to play baseball and he has to contribute when theres an opportunity
7435131 he works hard he gets treatment to get his knee where it needs to be there are no other options gary has to be ready to come in and do some of the things hes had to do in the last month he had a great game today
7435132 its just a little bump in the road ill be out of it shortly
7435133 theres a variety of things that could have happened other than a ground ball to third base
7435134 his knee wasnt feeling as good as he wanted but he didnt want to sit out another day
7435135 he and pentland have been working on a lot of different things well see if he can translate it to the big leagues when the time comes

7435143 hunter had a good look at it but it was obviously foul
7435144 im glad they put their heads together and made the right call
7435145 i dont want to sound selfish because this is about the team and winning games but i would love to get that record

7435172 we have a film that plays to a broad audience and one that perhaps bears repeat viewing
7435173 its the only comedy for this demographic for the summer
7435174 this is in line with how his movies do its an intriguing film
7435175 comedy is ruling the box office and audiences are showing theyre in the mood to have a good time
7435176 the fbi correctly diagnosed that mortgage fraud was epidemic but it did not come close to meeting its announced goal
7435177 it used everyday procedures and woefully inadequate resources to deal with an epidemic
7435178 the approach was certain to bring symbolic prosecutions and strategic defeat
7435179 we were dealing with the issue as best we could back then
7435180 at the same time we cant talk about the problems weve fixed

7435190 they never relied on financial engineering per se as the sole basis of generating return
7435191 they paid up but generally not as much as the bigger firms

7435196 all things in scripture are not alike plain in themselves nor alike clear unto all

7435198 some of those 234 taskings were to deal with a tin of beans jammed in a spout or concealed in an odd place or a replica weapon sometimes but other requests were to deal with real devices which hadnt exploded but which nevertheless were viable and capable of killing and maiming
7435199 the figures for forced departures from homes and the ato call outs are not very comforting
7435200 the chief constable should rethink that strategy until he can assure the public in that border area in particular that the threat from dissident republicans has been substantially reversed

7435202 the use of this image is in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7435203 the mayor is deeply concerned by the realisation that a shot of myra hindley was shown in a short video at london house and asked that it not be shown again
7435204 british art definitely represents some of the best of british but of all the many masterpieces that could have been used this was the most regrettable and the least inspired choice
7435205 it is a total disgrace this proud night for britain has been sullied by this grotesque representation of london clearly whoever was responsible must be found and fired immediately
7435206 this is a general three minute video of london in which an artwork by marcus harvey very fleetingly appears the video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade
7435207 there has never been a complaint made about the video up until this point however if any offence has been caused we will withdraw it from use with immediate effect harveys portrait called myra has caused controversy since he unveiled it in 1995

7435218 not only did kenny do us proud in the ring but he was also an inspirational captain throughout the whole boxing tournament kenny and our two other medalists paddy barnes and darren sutherland can be truly be proud of their achievements
7435219 recent price cuts at the supermarket petrol pumps have so far had no effect on consumer inflation expectations
7435220 the knock on effect of this trend is that people will negotiate for higher pay rises and retailers will try harder to hike prices because the climate is more lenient towards inflation this will only hinder efforts to bring inflation under control

7435236 if you still dont like a book after slogging through the first 50 pages set it aside if youre more than 50 years old subtract your age from 100 and only grant it that many pages
7435237 life is too short to fill in the appropriate activity here
7435238 ick i dont like this book im not going to waste my time on it
7435239 i just wanted to do something that i enjoyed rather than something that was boring
7435240 i made a sculpture out of trash bags and actual trash jake lockers dad saw me picking up trash after the arizona game last year for his project i was in the tailgate part and i was grabbing all the trash that was pretty weird they thought i was grabbing cans for recycling
7435241 i was just lucky if you just do your fundamentals and just go hard plays will come to you then you have great teammates to help too at oregon state greyson gunheim flushed the qb out and i got a forced fumble it was greyson who made the play but you dont hear that part of it
7435242 hes lit my fire more than ive lit his fire
7435243 its instead of terrorism he never quits thats the thing that separates him from any other defensive linemen his motor is always going you think youve got him and you let up and hell come back and get you
7435244 he has credibility we all follow those with credibility and he has credibility
7435245 the coaches asked me what position i play and i said center and they pointed me at bern
7435246 all he would tell me is how skinny i was and how weak i was because i was 135 pounds he pretty much would make me eat and make me lift and make me do all this stuff that i really didnt want to do and then i started to see the results
7435247 give him more opportunities and hell continue to make those plays ill be shocked if he didnt pick his play up more this year going into his third year of experience
7435248 if he didnt play hard all the time hed still be a good college football player but thats not him thats not what he wants he wants to go get it at the next level
7435249 those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
7435250 i could not become anything neither bad nor good neither a scoundrel nor an honest man neither a hero nor an insect and now i am eking out my days in my corner taunting myself with the bitter and entirely useless consolation that an intelligent man cannot seriously become anything that only a fool can become something
7435251 those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety

7435253 him and i will be linked forever because of that one play and now theres two plays
7435254 i would love to get that record im not going to lie to you
7435255 in the meantime its something i cant control weve got a long way to go and im still looking forward to getting some more opportunities im very blessed and very happy all the work i put into it i think its paid off but i dont want to sound selfish its not all about me its about the ballclub and winning ballgames
7435256 man it was a beautiful day compared to saturday with the heat and humidity
7435257 dempster said that was worse than pitching in florida during the day it was perfect conditions today the wind kept blowing in a little bit too it was a good day to pitch
7435258 every time he goes out there he gives you a consistent effort
7435259 i think hes had one start where hes given up runs outside of that he goes into the sixth or seventh inning depending on the pitch count and gives you a chance to win a ballgame
7435260 there were photographers there and i told them exactly where i was going to go i said right there make sure you wait for me there its just a positive attitude
7435261 it was definitely a bad day we lost a ton of points
7435262 this is a race thats very tough unfortunately we got the bad end of the stick i guess we just need to shrug it off and come back strong next week
7435263 im so glad and happy especially after such a disaster in hungary
7435264 its pressure were very excited about it but we have a serious piece of work to complete before the world shows up on our doorstep in 2010
7435265 youd have to be a pretty severe critic not to have enjoyed this
7435266 is the most magnificent piece of geography that you could possibly want
7435267 all this does is spur people on to be more creative
7435268 it will be very canadian were a very different place and a very different city the world lives in vancouver its a very diverse place an environment thats very friendly
7435269 we have 18 months of very hard work ahead of us but i think were setting ourselves up for success
7435270 the world today is in need of mutual understanding inclusiveness cooperation and harmonious development
7435271 the olympics is proof that people do support the country and what the country is pursuing the government should allow citizens to have a louder voice
7435272 citizens have to be actively participating and the government has to allow that
7435273 weve had chances in those recent games we just came flying on offense tonight
7435274 i think weve been playing well the final piece just came tonight
7435275 you dont see the visiting team score three and lose very often
7435276 i watched their players walk off the field and they were just gutted
7435277 but i told her i had one already and the way they treated us at the wynn it was the least i could do
7435278 thats one way to get a lifetime pass to the front of the buffet line
7435279 how many of the schools listed in u s news amp world reports top 25 american colleges also were listed among the associated press top 25 college football teams
7435280 first of all i think kobe bryant and lebron james have too much time on their hands
7435281 these guys want to be the best players in the world
7435282 ive been on tnt for years and no ones ever asked me who won the championship in greece last year
7435283 she said papa youre going to break my rod because it was bent double
7435284 he turned the water over and i saw his tail was about as wide as my two hands
7435285 truth is everybody will play quarterback this year because the bears offensive line is expected to be brought up on manslaughter charges
7435286 my arm was too erratic i used to clear out the dugouts
7435287 ill probably catch up on a lot of sleep the next few days
7435288 it felt really good to be the world champions especially since i made the last out
7435289 there were a lot of cross ups i dont know why that was
7435290 i like to keep him covered early like a turf horse because he started off running on grass
7435291 im looking forward to it it would be great if curlin comes if big brown comes that would be terrific competition
7435292 if were going to keep these guys and were going to play them this year then just go ahead and play them
7435293 they may make some mistakes early but i think in the long run it will make us a better team
7435294 that stage is over with he doesnt have a choice
7435295 i feel like its my team my offense and im taking that role
7435296 i think guys understand that and theyre buying into it this summer and im excited and getting ready for this year and trying to help guys out as much as i can
7435297 im glad im back and monday should be a full go
7435298 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish
7435299 and through trial and error i finally settled on the type of spit for the task at hand
7435300 we were just listening to each other smiling on the phone
7435301 this team has come a long way and we had a lot of blowouts those first few games
7435302 so it was fitting that this one would be a close one it really tested us to see what we were all about and in the end we showed were the best in the world
7435303 it was more teamwork probably well directed by their coaching staff
7435304 ive seen the guys hungry and want to get back to the top thats what theyve done they were able to get to the top again and show that they should be in first place but they had to work for it
7435305 if it wasnt for the determination and the willpower that we have in each other we wouldnt have pulled through and gotten this win
7435306 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7435307 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7435308 when youve got a gold medal here youre somebody when you have a silver youre not
7435309 its going to hurt tonight and hurt tomorrow but as the months go on theyre going to realize what a huge deal this is
7435310 it will be a tournament that people remember for the ages
7435311 usa water polo hasnt been on the podium in 20 years we wanted the gold but im happy i have a medal around my neck
7435312 i think we can try to win several silver and bronze medals
7435313 throughout the years dockwise has been engaged in projects for different international navies with a large variety of naval equipment involved mobilizing or demobilizing military naval equipment on its own power is for different reasons not always possible the capacity of the dockwise vessels often allows for creative and unorthodox solutions apart from other arguments such as safety security reduction of wear and tear and predetermined arrival targets the contribution of these contracts once again indicates the importance of the market diversity on which the dockwise strategy is built
7435314 its very complex the city owns numerous properties citywide and in some areas outside of the city
7435315 we are going through all of those properties and developing a legally defensible rule
7435316 its not like were picking at seattle but i think we would have numerous jurisdictions having numerous different rules and it would create great confusion
7435317 were trying to ensure the safety of the residents of the city and visitors to the city
7435318 were taking what we believe are common sense steps to do that
7435319 sound transit has worked with mercer island and with developers and construction project staff to remind construction crews that the garage facility is for transit users and that construction workers should not park there to access their sites
7435320 with so many new riders who are trying transit the best advice is to plan ahead arrive early and try walking biking car pooling or using transit to make your connection
7435321 there are a few spaces on western avenue but all say charter bus and the time limit is 15 minutes
7435322 i dont know how to explain it the idea of these individuals stuck in a cage with nowhere to go and to keep them in those cages for decades
7435323 i just couldnt imagine that chimps have self awareness and understand where theyre at
7435324 there was this look in his eyes he had such kind eyes it just spoke to me
7435325 and then knowing his history in labs that just solidified for me what a sanctuary can do for chimps
7435326 i see the retirement community idea as simply another ploy by the animal rights community to reach their eventual goal of abolishing the use of animals in research im not opposed to it but i think it is being driven by an animal rights point of view
7435327 he researched it very carefully he knew what he was getting into its a commitment you make for life they dont go away to college
7435328 i think its a total and complete waste of money
7435329 i reuse my shopping bags i dont have a car i dont like being told what to do
7435330 its about community building it gets people out on the streets
7435331 there arent safe places in the city for kids to learn to ride a bike
7435332 this is a great start we applaud the city for doing this
7435333 when youre moving or you need a ride to the airport on a friday afternoon that is when you find out who your friends are
7435334 if we dont remember the past the past is doomed to repeat itself
7435335 well this isnt my kid amp i have no place to tell these people how to raise their kid
7435336 detectives are treating the incident as an abduction and are liaising closely with as there is a possibility that bailey may be in the south of the young girl was described as being about 5 1

7435343 i am very happy that a place which was being used for destructing peoples lives will now be used for making lives of various people happier and healthier
7435344 people who used to come here for lust and addiction will now be coming for meditation and i say that all bars in mumbai which cause no good to any person should be converted to these types of yoga centres
7435345 it will consist of various types of physical and spiritual training including yoga meditation and pranayam we will also provide medical treatment at nominal cost and it will be absolutely free for the poor
7435346 only six people complained of total blindness which we are attending to others suffering from irritation are also being attended to and are responding favourably
7435347 hes in the clear and was very happy about it
7435348 we gave him a self testing kit to take away
7435349 id love to replicate this in india as well im sure theyve many such initiatives in india but if i can link up and do something more why not

7435351 some right honourable and honourable members will have diabetes but will be unaware of it
7435352 with this illness you dont know if you have got it and you can go to sleep and not wake up
7435353 it is important to approach films on such issues with sensitivity for the making of dark the team was briefed to bring out the strength of the people who are faced with disability and ensure that their strength was celebrated
7435354 the film evoked the concept of how even in the dark the visually impaired lead a normal life
7435355 in fact although its a constraint to get films like this screened as they are produced digitally and not on film 60 mm or 35 mm many of our films including dark which is in bengali has been aired on national tv in kolkata and on a national channel like sahara
7435356 the challenge is drawing attention mainstreaming id love to watch such films on television they are any day more informative and entertaining than the trash we get to see nowadays
7435357 despite recognition there is a lack of facilities and opportunities not because of lack of doing but lack of wanting to do something
7435358 disability should be enveloped in the mainstream commercial cinemas movies on disability like black and taare zameen par are few and scarce
7435359 i almost fell off my chair watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it
7435360 she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 percent cast iron damage proof
7435361 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7435362 theres going to be a lot of rhetoric coming out of the convention but we want to match that with barack obama s record and tell people hes not ready to be president
7435363 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7435364 the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton she had 50 percent of the democratic vote obama has 50 per cent of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7435365 there s a lot of hillary supporters that are concerned that obama doesn
7435366 ultimately we look forward to a debate between joe biden and barack obama about whether obama has the judgment and experience to lead
7435367 the choice on iraq in this election is clear and compelling
7435368 joe biden believes the war was a mistake mccain would still do it all over again biden knows the bush mccain policy has weakened our hand fighting terrorism and finding osama bin laden
7435369 john mccain started beating the drums for war after september 11th and wants to double down on the bush policy for four more years
7435370 it is a world in itself with all the latest amenities it has its own power water and maintenance departments
7435371 an independent house or just a regular apartment does not offer that security but in a gated community these residents can leave their house for some months without fear of being broken into or tampered with
7435372 the two countries have established a good neighbourly partnership and enjoyed friendship generation upon generation
7435373 this fully demonstrates the great attention nepal attaches to relations with china and its profound friendship with the chinese people we highly appreciate that

7435375 debido a su demencia ella no hac a m s que olvidarse que estaba muerto ten a que repetirle la mala noticia una y otra vez
7435376 casi me caigo de la silla observar su esfuerzo con las palabras y la memoria no pod a creerlo ella ten a 75 a os pero siempre pensaba que era una persona que no envejec a sin tiempo y ciento por ciento de hierro
7435377 el contraste se ala fue a n m s sorprendente porque hasta ese momento su memoria era siempre como internet
7435378 he tenido que aprender a tener paciencia una cualidad que admito no es abundante tambi n he tenido que aprender que ten a una enfermedad y que no era nada personal
7435379 for decades mr biden has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7435380 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7435381 back in june and july i truly thought he was going to blow mccain out of the water and carry 30 or 40 states
7435382 what has happened is that republicans mccain specifically have really twisted his great charisma this electric personality to discredit his ability his experience his capacity his judgment i fear they are about to do to him what they did to gore
7435383 obama has got to do some things that will shore up his ability to lead not just to charm but to lead theyve got to give credibility to his understanding of foreign policy his ability to deal with tough people and tough questions and his ability to be more explicit and convincing on his health care policies and energy policies
7435384 normally i might say these conventions are not so important but i dont think thats the case this year
7435385 there seems to be a sense of urgency we have had a couple of weeks that were not so good
7435386 i think in the case of mccain they need to frame him
7435387 viscerally my feeling is theyve got to come back at him hard and theyve got to do more to complete the task of definition both definition of him as well as definition of john mccain
7435388 he has still got to get to the meat and potato blue collar workers this is a big opportunity for him
7435389 i have a lot of doubts that this convention is going to be as persuasive as it should be because theyve got this damn thing with hillary
7435390 i love hillary i was for her but this is the worst political decision i could imagine this is supposed to be an obama celebration youre going to get the nomination of someone who came very close to winning and youre going to get a lot of people in there cheering and hollering and some people booing
7435391 there has got to be a full reconciliation between the clinton people and the obama people i think the convention will put to rest any past divisions among supporters
7435392 i cant wait to hear hillary clinton talk about the future and am excited that her candidacy is unifying our party

7435400 it signalled a degree of return to normality and recovery that everyone here understood immediately we had stopped reviewing restaurants critically since hurricane katrina because we felt it was impossible for the restaurants with their staff shortages and limited facilities to achieve the standards our critic would apply now we have decided that the restaurant scene is robust enough to withstand critiquing the new york times wrote a piece about it which shows they understood how much a bread and butter issue like that means to the city
7435401 many houses slowly rot still bearing on their walls the painted marks left by the us military to show whether corpses were inside
7435402 i dont think we are on peoples minds we have to contend with those voices particularly on pop radio which say new orleanians with their eternal whining why dont they pull themselves up by their boot straps it cuts both ways we are regarded with distrust because we do these strange things like mardi gras and we have far too much fun which seems un american and that produces resentment there is also a deep well of affection for the place as we see from the volunteers who have come here in their thousands to help the rebuilding
7435403 katrina is and will be a defining moment of our lives a story well be telling till the day we die
7435404 i wondered a year and a half ago whether there would ever come a time when the word hurricane or katrina would not appear on or near page one
7435405 the two themes we heard were be patient and do not expect too much for several years and the other was dont expect government to be the generator of your recovery because you will be disappointed
7435406 thats been true of the federal government which although it did provide quite a bit of funds was deplorable in getting them to the people and it was right about the amount of volunteerism which one would normally discount as nice but insufficient but has proved tremendous
7435407 we have not so much changed in the degree of our localness but the paper has changed in intensity and relevance because so much was at stake the very survival of the community was hanging in the balance
7435408 before katrina there were colleagues in the newsroom who were sceptical of the value of the internet but then even the most dinosaurish realised this was the only way to reach scattered readers it changed our owners view of the website too because suddenly we went from 700 000 page views to 30 million over night it was a sea change for us
7435409 everything happens on a micro scale of thousands of little decisions with each one having a thousand little ingredients can i afford it what is my insurance going to be can i find a contractor to help me will i be all alone in a block without neighbours
7435410 we are part of the plot and thats deeply unsettling its the story of our lives the papers and the citys and we must both live and chronicle it

7435416 sal mas o menos bien y luego pude recuperar una posici n justamente con nakajima pero luego al llegar a la cuarta curva not un empuj n muy grande por detr s y cuando mir por los retrovisores he visto que me faltaba el aler n trasero y tuve que entrar en boxes
7435417 intentamos reparar el coche y cuando llegamos a boxes me qued sentado en el durante tres o cuatro vueltas ya que intentamos arreglarlo por el hecho simplemente de correr ya que estamos aqu en valencia delante de todo el mundo y quer a acabar la carrera en la posici n que fuese y aunque perdiese muchas vueltas al final
7435418 comenc muy bien pero en la primera curva fui sobre el bordillo y lewis me cerr
7435419 antes que nada un gran elogio a los organizadores del acontecimiento por una primera carrera tan buena
7435420 mi salida fue buena y pude adelantar a kimi antes de la primera curva

7435425 i had my chances but i was unlucky not to make it 4 4 it would have interesting if it had gone 4 4
7435426 marcus started well and went 2 0 up but i didnt really do too much wrong
7435427 i just managed to stick in there at 3 1 down and when i was in amongst the balls i didnt miss much
7435428 i made a few good breaks my safety wasnt too good but overall ive got to be happy with the win because thats all i wanted
7435429 hes shaun one of the best players in the world so if i could manage to turn him over it would be a good win for me
7435430 im probably one of the toughest draws in the second round i think hell probably have wanted to play an easy qualifier
7435431 i had flu when i arrived with hard fevers every day ive been low on energy and i also had quite a big problem with a spasm in my neck which almost led to me not racing this weekend
7435432 i woke up very early yesterday around 5am and i had this spasm but fortunately ive a great doctor who was with me all the way through it
7435433 it was so bad i was even struggling to stand up so i had to have injections in my neck and take plenty of painkillers
7435434 so i think eight points is a good effort i thought i did a pretty decent job considering
7435435 the track is not that physical it was just that it was hot
7435436 there was not enough water in the car and as we are in these big old suits it was like driving in a sauna
7435437 it is was quite a hectic one and half hour race so i am pretty happy the way i got through
7435438 the great thing is we came away with some strong points for myself and for the team
7435439 we are showing we have great reliability and that is due to all the team doing a fantastic job
7435440 these golf courses are so difficult week in and week out
7435441 it makes you a great golfer and youve got great fields so you just have to be very patient and opportunities come along
7435442 i felt that was an opportunity today and im annoyed at myself i probably let it slip by a little bit
7435443 the ryder cup is at the back of my mind right now
7435444 i was trying to go out and win a golf tournament today
7435445 you know id love to be on that team darren has put the cats amongst the pigeons today by winning that was a great win went out there from the front extended the lead it was impressive stuff
7435446 weve got ian poulter as well who is just outside its going to be tough
7435447 i didnt really do anything wrong today its such a tough golf course and ive said that all week that you dont have to do much wrong to get into trouble
7435448 and i played a nice conservative round of golf for nine holes which was sort of the plan and maybe look at the leaderboard and see what i had to do
7435449 im annoyed at myself because the one error i made was the third shot into the par five i had a lob wedge in my hand and i just quit on it didnt hit it hard enough tried to get cute with it
7435450 that was pretty much what killed it right there because if i had knocked that one close and made birdie i would have had a good chance of winning
7435451 i have spoken to nick i wont repeat what he said but he hasnt told me what hes doing yet
7435452 it was definitely not the weekend i was hoping for
7435453 but i do not believe despite this negative result i am now out of the running for the title there are still six races to go and 60 points up for grabs
7435454 we have seen that the situation can change really quickly even if i realise things are now more complicated
7435455 there is no doubt it wont be easy we need to see what we can do in the next race the belgian grand prix but we need to start wining again otherwise there is no chance
7435456 i made a mistake and left before i should have done
7435457 fortunately pietro is not too badly hurt i wish him all the best and hope he gets better soon
7435458 but in any case it would not have changed anything as then the engine broke
7435459 but we need to investigate what was wrong with the engine maybe it is similar to what happened with felipe in the last race
7435460 we need to look at what happened as i have no idea why kimi blew an engine
7435461 we are working to fix the reliability as it has been an issue for us this year especially the first race australia last race and this race
7435462 we need to work very hard with everybody concentrating to solve every problem we have
7435463 after such a disaster in hungary weve come here to a great track and done a fantastic job although not 100 per cent because of what happened with kimi

7435474 el taxol funciona bien al principio de 79 a 89 por ciento de los pacientes responden pero fracasa al final porque desarrolla resistencia a la droga
7435475 en esencia la tecnolog a puede ser usada para vencer uno de los m s desafiantes tipos de problemas de la resistencia a la droga esto podr a ser utilizado potencialmente con cualquier droga que resulte efectiva pero que genere un problema de rechazo no solamente el taxol
7435476 es como una especie de rechazo si uno no es reconocido como parte del club entonces a uno lo echan
7435477 si pensamos que el aparato de bombeo es un rechazo para el club celular lo que efectivamente estamos haciendo es ocultar uno de esos agentes terap uticos para que entre por la puerta de atr s o la lateral no vamos a tratar con el rechazo
7435478 la naturaleza ha desarrollado todo esto para poder meter elementos en las c lulas y una de las maneras es crear entidades que son ricas en arginina
7435479 las secuencias ricas en arginina figuran en el mecanismo por el cual muchos pat genos invaden c lulas es un resultado estimulante para llevar a una droga conocida que funciona contra el c ncer pero que termina frustrada por la resistencia de las c lulas y restaurarle su efectividad usando un transportador de arginina esto tiene buen futuro para el uso con otras drogas que sucumben a la resistencia

7435606 despu s de la sesi n de calificaci n de ayer sab a que el fin de semana iba a ser complicado
7435607 la primera vuelta ha sido complicada ya que estaba en medio del grupo y he perdido varias posiciones
7435608 es fant stico haber ganado esta carrera especialmente despu s de lo que pas en budapest
7435609 no tengo mucho que decir despu s de un d a como este no fue el fin de semana que esperaba pero no creo que despu s del resultado de hoy est fuera de la lucha por el t tulo todav a quedan 6 carreras y 60 puntos hemos visto que la situaci n cambia continuamente aunque s es cierto que las cosas est n ahora m s complicadas hoy perd una posici n en la salida y me qued casi parado detr s del tr fico durante todo mi primer stint cuando tuve pista libre pude hacer buenos tiempos en el segundo pitstop comet un error y sal antes de lo debido afortunadamente pietro timpini no est herido de gravedad le deseo todo lo mejor y espero que se recupere pronto en todo caso sin el incidente del pitstop tampoco habr a cambiado nada ya que el motor se rompi ahora debemos concentrarnos en prepararnos para las siguientes carreras y mejorar nuestro rendimiento en calificaci n

7435618 i hope the country can now move beyond the century of shame and humiliation thinking and ditch all that stuff in its psyche for the past 60 years
7435619 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time

7435621 im going to get asked about this arent i i though it was just between me and her
7435622 for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace
7435623 its satans ultimate desire to cause christians to believe that living under grace has abolished the necessity of obeying gods law or that it is of no consequence what you believe as long as you believe in jesus the bible disagrees with both of these notions
7435624 obedience to gods law will never save however the law plays an integral role in pointing out what sin is thus creating a need for christ the saviour the fruit of accepting this invitation is living in obedience to gods laws
7435625 jesus said that if you love me keep my commandments and seeing that he and the father are one then the ten commandments are also jesus commandments
7435626 if god could have canceled his law then jesus would never have needed suffer death on the cross in place of humanitys transgression of gods law
7435627 the one thing that could re create the west is russia acting in opposition to the west nato had lost its way the russians have created a situation which gives nato a raison detre again to contain russia

7435629 theres no unity at all within europe the newer eu countries are far more anti russian than the older ones
7435630 of course many countries like germany and italy that buy their oil and gas from russia they have to worry that if the relationship deteriorates it will have an impact on their economy
7435631 the way it unfolds in germany will be tremendously important because germany is an in between country
7435632 during the cold war europe always had a more moderate position than the united states had a more pragmatic position just for reasons of geographic proximity and because europe tends to have a more pragmatic policy than the u s

7435692 in an earlier survey on the election and health care reform physicians were fairly evenly divided as to the solution for improving our health care system
7435693 twenty seven percent said it was universal health care with multi payer reimbursement twenty three percent said it was universal health care with single payer reimbursement and twenty five percent selected tax credits to allow more people to afford healthcare
7435694 universal health care would reduce my income in the short term but the longer term effect would be good since the current system isnt sustainable

7435761 our findings support the idea that bondage and discipline and sadomasochism bdsm is simply a sexual interest or subculture attractive to a minority associate professor juliet richters and her colleagues wrote in the
7435762 however they were no more likely to have been coerced into sexual activity and were not significantly more likely to be unhappy or anxious said prof richters author of the book
7435763 people with these sexual interests have long been seen by medicine and the law as at best damaged and in need of therapy and at worst dangerous and in need of legal regulation she said
7435764 and need particularly strong stimuli such as being beaten or tied up to become aroused

7435768 the policies have to address the needs of those 400 thousand people and they need to be inclusive they need to be long term and so the policies need to demonstrate long term investment not just short term
7435769 the companys first half growth is driven by an increase in cargo handling especially in jebel ali and acquisitions in africa and saudi arabia
7435770 dp world operates in regions that are expected to witness a rapid increase in utilization rates and shortage in capacity
7435771 this means margins will improve significantly reflecting positively on the companys earnings
7435772 we are striving to strengthen the stature of the club as a pioneering media platform regionally as well as internationally to that effect we are upgrading our workforce by incorporating the best talents and capabilities
7435773 strengthening relations with media organisations is an important part of our strategy we are confident that muna will be able to achieve excellent results she will play an effective role since she enjoys good relationships with all the major media organizations and government bodies in the country
7435774 its media programmes are the mainstay of the press club i look forward to contributing dynamically to the diverse programs and activities of the club and moving it into newer heights of success and excellence
7435775 although fuel prices have fallen gradually in recent weeks it is still some 60 above the average price of us 73 per barrel in 2007 high fuel prices continue to be a big challenge for emirates and we are monitoring the situation closely
7435776 we are investing in land in sudan pakistan and egypt to secure food supplies without being at the mercy of market fluctuations
7435777 food import costs will rise in line with population increases
7435778 up to 10 per cent of the gulfs total import bill is for food
7435779 but high oil prices have provided an important cushion for these countries to manage higher food prices
7435780 they will face problems dealing with all sorts of transactions including banking in case they dont get the card
7435781 the identity card which is meant to verify identity and simplify transactions will be compulsory for all emiratis from the beginning of next year
7435782 we had talks with the abu dhabi traffic department which culminated in making the card mandatory for emiratis to transfer the ownership of their cars and do other transactions at the department
7435783 other departments will follow to link the card to services that will gradually enable the holders to use it as a multipurpose smart card
7435784 among the unregistered emiratis most of them are children below 15 years parents coming for registration do not bring their children due to a misunderstanding that it is not compulsory
7435785 we give an identity number to children which is compulsory for any official transactions including educational matters
7435786 this is already a strong market for us and we are excited to position the company in this key business area this is an excellent place to live and a perfect environment from which to forge a working climate that is germane to the progression of international business
7435787 talking about peace in this vital area of the world requires intensified efforts to remove all causes of tension therefore establishing an effective balance of power in the region will be achieved only if all middle east countries undertake to ban the use of nuclear and other mass destruction weapons
7435788 an important move that agrees with the gcc countries efforts aimed at developing a peaceful nuclear energy program with the commitment to full transparency and the highest standards of non proliferation and of safety and security
7435789 from a french perspective the requests of countries wishing to benefit from this clean low cost energy are legitimate
7435790 in the face of the global challenges such as global warming and raising cost of oil we cannot content ourselves with seeing only to our own french needs
7435791 nuclear energy can be a tool for peace it can be a tool for development
7435792 hydrocarbon fuels are not bad for the climate just because they contain carbon
7435793 with the continuing industrialization of developing countries global energy consumption will be increasing for the foreseeable future
7435794 it is a rational decision to develop domestic energy production in a way that allows the exporting of oil and gas to answer to growing global demand
7435795 the united arab emirates is taking its part in the proper management of our globe
7435796 it is certain that the country will take its global responsibilities seriously and environmental issues will be high amongst its priorities
7435797 without heating in the winter we could not survive in our northern latitudes
7435798 we in cnia are proud of the alliance that we have formed with the nypd we are confident that with this partnership we will be able to forge new ties of cross cultural understanding between us we will work together towards broadening the knowledge base of our authority
7435799 i believe that it is the beginning of a positive relationship we hope this alliance will foster an exchange of information and training to improve security

7435804 sensationeel topsport van de bovenste plank absolute wereldklasse er bestaan nauwelijks woorden om te beschrijven wat tia hellebaut voor elkaar kreeg
7435805 ze won de meest hoogstaande olympische hoogspringfinale aller tijden en is de eerste belgische vrouw die in de atletiek olympisch goud wint
7435806 amper n dag na het belgische 4x100m zilver overtrof tia hellebaut zichzelf n de verwachtingen met 2 05m een nieuw belgisch record maakte ze een van de hoogste sprongen uit de geschiedenis een wereldprestatie die hellebaut meteen onsterfelijk maakt
7435807 de prestatie van hellebaut is eentje om in te lijsten in de internationale atletiekgeschiedenis aller tijden

7435811 belgi won de eerste echte gouden medaille sinds fred deburghgraeve en ulla werbrouck in atlanta in 1996 het speeltuingoud van henin vier jaar geleden is van een lagere orde
7435812 tia hellebaut restaureerde daarmee de hi rarchie in de belgische sport zij is lang niet de meest gef teerde maar al een tijdje de beste belgische atlete op wereldvlak
7435813 dat blanka vlasic geen 35e wedstrijd op rij wint is te wijten aan een ongenadige tegenstander een waar
7435814 vlasic kloppen stond gelijk aan sneller lopen dan usain bolt op de 100m michael phelps verslaan op de 200m vlinderslag of een korf meer maken dan de amerikaanse basketballers

7435907 a satellite goes over the same part of the earth twice a day and one of those is at night so its only really getting a snapshot of activity zephyr would be watching all day
7435908 we think zephyr is very close to an operational system within the next two years is what were aiming for
7435909 we have one more step of improvements we trying to design a robust and reliable system that will really sit up there for months and we want to push the performance
7435910 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7435911 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7435912 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7435913 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7435914 its an initiative that belittles the role of nuns who have dedicated themselves to god
7435915 its a wonderful success story a win win for everyone owners get a fair market value for their property and community residents get to continue living in their homes

7435922 parents looking to adopt can expect a roller coaster kind of life
7435923 things may be a certain way at the beginning but it may take longer if things change
7435924 i just think these children are in worse shape than the american children
7435925 when families first come to us they have this vision of those little girls about 2 years old who dont have lots of issues
7435926 when children are a little older they have endured a little more trauma and have behavior that reflects that trauma
7435927 a lot of people go into adoptions with the gerber baby as their initial expectation
7435928 i gave up waiting for mr right going internationally didnt even cross my mind
7435929 we probably put far too much research and thought into it

7435933 xero except are forced to use myob to deal with u
7435934 i use xero simply the best streamlines that part of the business for me whilst we are growing not location dependent very handy
7435935 this really confirms that this pattern has been happening already
7435936 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7435937 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7435938 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7435939 especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
7435940 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7435941 he does not waive us doing what we would have to do without the waiver so it doesnt change anything in the environment
7435942 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event
7435943 we had a concern that this was going to happen
7435944 you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength
7435945 time will come when people will not endure sound doctrine but wanting to have their ears tickled they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths

7435947 recovering the scandal of the cross atonement in new testament amp contemporary contexts
7435948 it is like a mustard seed which is the smallest seed you plant in the ground
7435949 we dont yet see things clearly were squinting in a fog peering through a mist but it wont be long before the weather clears and the sun shines bright well see it all then see it all as clearly as god sees us knowing him directly just as he knows us
7435950 you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind and your neighbor as yourself

7435952 simply accept the existence of religion as a given part of our humanity
7435953 the reading of modern belles lettres and philosophy was forbidden by strict censorship
7435954 kant tried to show that both the laws of nature and the laws of morality are grounded in human reason itself
7435955 carve out a space for religion significantly different from what kant and fichte had done he wanted to provide a new understanding of religion
7435956 ideas and principles are all foreign to religion if ideas and principles are to be anything they must belong to knowledge which is a different department of life from religion
7435957 we have in schleiermacher an intensely relational view of humanity emotions are significant not simply because they are felt but because they are inward witnesses and responses to realities other than the self
7435958 stylistically the book is neither a sermon nor a philosophical treatise but rather a typical literary performance in the spirit of the romantic age
7435959 schleiermachers formula for the essence of religion or more precisely of piety or personal religiousness is that it is a feeling of absolute dependence
7435960 is the source toward which the self consciousness of absolute dependence is directed
7435961 we can hardly be absolutely dependent unless there is something other than ourselves on which we are absolutely dependent
7435962 traced the basic religious impulse back to an encounter with the consciousness of holiness
7435963 i have been conducting experiments on myself for 30 years exploring the mysteries of chemistry and health my prescription eat a clove of garlic and drink our own urine and semen twice a day
7435964 i wanted to die i hesitated for a moment searching for words
7435965 but it was his depraved lifestyle that got him where he was
7435966 how could you withhold from him the one message that could drastically change his life
7435967 how then will they call on him in whom they have not believed how will they believe in him whom they have not heard and how will they hear without a preacher
7435968 how beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news of good things
7435969 because you were created by god and that makes you incredibly valuable
7435970 im worthless god could never accept a man like me
7435971 none of us are worthy to be accepted by god
7435972 were all broken and distorted but this is precisely why jesus died on the cross for our sins so that we could be accepted god does think your valuable he loves you emperor
7435973 ive been running from god for so long h how could i turn to him now
7435974 repent turn away from these things that are destroying you
7435975 i have been conducting experiments on myself for 30 years exploring the mysteries of chemistry and health
7435976 i wanted to die why did you save my life
7435977 there was never a point in which you confronted him to change his lifestyle or challenged him to repent
7435978 if i share the gospel with someone and they dont respond am i released from continuing to love them in practical ways
7435979 but it was his depraved lifestyle that got him where he was
7435980 how could you withhold from him the one message that could drastically change his life
7435981 how then will they call on him in whom they have not believed how will they believe in him whom they have not heard and how will they hear without a preacher
7435982 how beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news of good things
7435983 why do you care about me why do you love me
7435984 because you were created by god and that makes you incredibly valuable
7435985 im worthless god could never accept a man like me
7435986 none of us are worthy to be accepted by god
7435987 were all broken and distorted but this is precisely why jesus died on the cross for our sins so that we could be accepted god does think your valuable he loves you emperor
7435988 ive been running from god for so long h how could i turn to him now
7435989 repent turn away from these things that are destroying you believe in jesus with all your heart its never too late emperor never
7435990 why were not emergent by two guys who should be
7435991 lets do good deeds and dont worry about the rest because there is no hell anyways
7435992 a proposition is true just in case it corresponds to facts or the world
7435993 people discover truth they do not create it and that a claim is made true or false in some way or another by reality itself totally independent of whether the claim is accepted by anyone
7435994 a true proposition is one that belongs to some designated coherent set of propositions
7435995 1 that each member of the set i e proposition is consistent with any subset of the others and 2 that each is implied inductively if not deductively by all of the others taken as premises
7435996 it implies that a belief p is true if and only if p works or is useful to have p is true just in case p exhibits certain values for those who accept it
7435997 truth is relative to a linguistic community that shares the same narrative
7435998 someone divides a range of phenomena into two groups and goes on to claim that one is better than the other
7435999 kaufmanns strategy was to show that the contradiction in nietzsches position is merely apparent that nietzsche does not deny the existence of truth and that he does not put forward any metaphysical theories
7436000 as a denial of the eternal world of the platonic forms or the kantian thing in itself
7436001 this worldly fallible hypothetical perspectival value laden historically developed and simplifying truth
7436002 if one interprets will to power in traditional terms as straightforward claims about the nature of reality as claims that are supposed to correspond to reality it seems implausible to deny their metaphysical character
7436003 make claims to metaphysical truth while at the same time rejecting all such claims
7436004 why couldnt a false belief make us happier than a true one
7436005 what really is it in us that wants the truth why not rather untruth and uncertainty even ignorance
7436006 the essence of man the sole form of cognitive life with which we are acquainted has emerged in the course of universal becoming as a unique way of interpreting being
7436007 every single kind of intellect must have its own way of understanding the world
7436008 explain ing the problems with nietzsches theory of truth which necessitate its rejection
7436009 aristotle the stoics various medieval philosophers descartes locke hume moore and russell
7436010 jesus is god he is the logos the word that became flesh john 1 he is the underlying reason and force behind all existence he defines reality he sustains reality in this sense jesus is the truth we are not talking about any common man here we are talking about the god man the incarnation
7436011 any theory of truth which rejects the notion that truth is absolute is fundamentally flawed
7436012 he is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of all creation for by him all things were created both in the heavens and on earth visible and invisible all things have been created through him and for him he is before all things and in him all things hold together
7436013 quite remarkable that i would represent my interpretation of our brief conversation in such an authoritative posture in a public venue before dialoging with me further to clarify my position
7436014 be generous with others who may know more than you have a different context or experience or speak from one of the new testament offices that differs from your own
7436015 it seems disingenuous and frankly dishonest for you to approach me with feigned curiosity when apparently you were only looking to confirm your presuppositions about a perceived movement you hoped to critique
7436016 what a coincidence we are also followers of gods messenger jesus
7436017 im jesus christ the g n messiah jesus isnt coming back so you had better listen to me if you dont believe me then get out of my bus
7436018 i didnt explain this that you had shared the gospel with the emperor to you because your line of inquiry presumed that sharing the gospel means telling someone that they are a
7436019 taken a back by my deceptive and combative approach to you
7436020 it seems rather strange to me that you would approach someone 10 15 years older than you whom you dont know and begin an argument with them based on your presupposed straw man
7436021 jesus came to die for you sins so that when you die you can go to heaven what heaven is about is a whole nother topic when you die
7436022 for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is a gift from god not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god has before ordained that we should walk in them
7436023 now i would remind you brothers of the gospel i preached to you which you received in which you stand and by which you are being saved if you hold fast to the word i preached to you unless you have believed in vain for i delivered to you as of first importance what i also received that christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures that he was buried that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures
7436024 because christ also suffered for you leaving you an example so that you might follow in his steps he committed no sin neither was deceit found in his mouth when he was reviled he did not revile in return when he suffered he did not threaten but continued to trust himself to the one who judges justly he himself bore our sins in his body on the tree that we might die to sin and live to righteousness by his wounds you have been healed for you were straying like sheep but have now returned to the shepherd and bishop of your souls
7436025 brought into an open area from the restriction of oppression narrowed area from enemies
7436026 partnering with god in his restoration rescue project putting the whole world to rights
7436027 the spirit of the lord is on me because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor he has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind to release the oppressed to proclaim the year of the lords favor
7436028 in order for all this good news to take place i must first die on a cross for your sins
7436029 it is only his sacrifice on calvarys tree that can save us
7436030 jesus hadnt gone to the cross at that point obviously yet he says that zacchaues is saved today
7436031 for what does the scripture say abraham believed god and it was counted to him as righteousness
7436032 for the promise to abraham and his offspring remember that includes the uncircumcised gentiles that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith for if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs faith is null and the promise is void for the law brings wrath but where there is not law there is no transgression
7436033 but i say walk by the spirit and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh for the desires of the flesh are against the spirit and the desires of the spirit are against the flesh for these are opposed to each other to keep you from doing the things you want to do
7436034 and as they still went on and talked behold chariots of fire and horses of fire seperated the two of them
7436035 my father my father the chariots of israel and its horsemen
7436036 every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but he speaking of christ having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time sat down at the right hand of god
7436037 all these died in faith without receiving the promises but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth
7436038 for christ also died for sins once for all the just for the unjust so that he might bring us to god having been put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit
7436039 and when i came to you brethren i did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom proclaiming to you the testimony of god for i determined to know nothing among you except jesus christ and him crucified
7436040 do you know that if you died tonight that you would go to heaven
7436041 anyone who believes in him will not perish but has everlasting life
7436042 concerning this salvation the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired carefully inquiring what person or time the spirit of christ in them was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of christ and the subsequent glories it was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the holy spirit sent from heaven things into which angels long to look
7436043 these all died in faith not having received the things promised but having seen them and greeted them from afar and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth
7436044 do you know that if you died tonight that you would go to heaven
7436045 what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses his own soul
7436046 the redemption in jesus christ means the restoration of an original good creation in other words redemption is re creation
7436047 anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame
7436048 everyone who calls on the name of the lord will be saved

7436079 how does the young earth view of history explain this upward trend of conventional ages in the earths rock layers the concept of accelerated nuclear decay provides a compelling answer consider a burst of nuclear decay corresponding to several billions of years worth of decay at present rates this occurs during the really part of the week of creation as the earths original rocks are being formed this affects the radioisotopes within the entire earth including lower rocks which today are called basement rock as a result the original surface layer of the earth contains a large quantity of radioisotope daughter products to a person with conventional assumptions of deep time these decay products appear to imply an ancient age rate research further indicates that an additional accelerated decay episode then took place during the genesis flood event which occurred about 1 500 years after the creation this episode corresponded to roughly 500 million years worth of nuclear decay at todays rates
7436080 the exploration of accelerated nuclear decay mechanisms has taken us to many unexpected topics discussed in the book these include the strong force holding the nucleus together the quantum tunneling of alpha particles out of the nucleus cosmic strings higher dimensions and radioactive potassium 40 and carbon 14 inside living creatures such is the nature of scientific research where insights often come from surprising directions

7436109 there are issues involved with foreign policy and obamas experience that biden covers
7436110 the fact of the matter is we dont know what any of them are going to do until they get in office
7436111 do you select as your surgeon someone who just got out of medical school or someone who has been doing it for 20 years
7436112 i am incredibly disappointed for the team the drivers and the fans for such a fantastic race being ended by the stewards in such a manner clearly for many many laps the 45 porsche blocked us continuously there were many incidents where we had been taken off the course and i was really proud of the patience that dirk showed and the racecraft he used at the end to force the 45 into a mistake the penalty is non protestable clearly it leaves a very bad taste in everybodys mouth we are racing those guys for a championship and it does seem that following the elkhart lake road america incident nothing was done and now there is a decision made against us clearly the obvious thing is to go home and fight again another day
7436113 my stint was good i could overtake the porsche in front of me and i took second position but by that time the 62 was already gone so i took the pace of the leading car my goal was to keep the 45 car behind me i did that i was very very happy with my stint i was quite happy to take the podium with dirk but i am very frustrated in the decision of the officials
7436114 from the second stop everything was under control i was in the pack the whole time and i knew i could not press like the no 62 race winning ferrari it was like 55 minutes of studying where i could pass the 45 car i thought five times i was ahead but he just went wide the last lap he made a mistake he covered the inside of turn 5a and i positioned myself on the outside he came sideways between 5a and 5b i jumped inside nice and clean we had contact but the contact was because he was closing the door it was a nice and clear move i had many chances to make a dirty move and i did not take them the last contact was avoidable on his side i am very disappointed in this decision by the officials
7436115 i would have felt more comfortable and confident with one more second a lap but i had to play the hand i was dealt i just tried to do the best job that i could to drive it into the window and give it to alex to finish up he went out there and just peeled them off i improved by one position and he improved by one position i was really happy to finish with a great result alex did a phenomenal job bringing it home
7436116 it was a great result the guys were great but i think i lost a little time on the pit stops i need to get the rhythm right on cranking the ignition as the car is dropping jim did a great job he made huge strides here i just cant say enough about that that was probably our biggest gain of the weekend i knew he was a little bit heartbroken to go down that lap in the end but with all that prototype traffic there isnt much you can do about it i am really looking forward to detroit
7436117 it was a fantastic race with a difficult strategic decision in the final phase
7436118 that was a real challenge for me when i had to overtake almost all prototypes again at the end of the race it worked out well our car was not in a perfect shape after our little mishap in the pits and i really had to fight our engineer told me on the radio that i had to push like hell i did and fortunately it worked out
7436119 i ve not seen such a great race for quite a while it was really exciting it was nail biting because we were not sure if we could bring the victory home there were two different strategies for our two cars it s great that this gave us a 1 2 victory it was really close in the end for emanuele pirro who opted for the save fuel method we went flat out but had to pit under green i dedicate this victory to our boys who worked a lot this week and put a great car on the wheels for us
7436120 it was a difficult race because we gambled a little bit with the fuel from one side it was good because we really used the last drop of diesel that was in our tank this allowed us to finish second on the very last lap on the other side we lost the chance to fight for the victory as soon we had to back off and save fuel this was a little bit frustrating but it is a great result for audi and we enjoy it
7436121 i really learned to save fuel during the stint i was two steps of power down but this was not enough and i had to roll the car into the corners despite that my lap times were good enough to keep the lmp 2 cars behind i m not happy about the race result because we had a fast car but we gambled and didn t make it i m happy on how we managed the situation and i m happy about the way i drove i literally ran out of fuel at start and finish it was good to finish second in these conditions
7436122 it was definitely a team effort after rebuilding one car on friday all the way into the night because of a damaged monocoque the team performed extremely well and our four drivers were great the complete team did a great job i m very pleased
7436123 this was an absolutely fantastic and quite unbelievable race a brilliant job by jordy lead engineer jordan eber to manufacture fuel out of thin air certainly helped our cause that guy ought to go in to the exploration business because he can find oil and gas like nobody i know the entire team did a fantastic job and we made some great pit calls the car was quick all weekend scott did a great job to get us into the fight and david brought home a fantastic finish it was tough luck for gil de ferran to run out of fuel at the end that was really heartbreaking for them but their first win will come for sure but for us its win number four baby
7436124 we did a fantastic job here today the last two races have been about fuel and the team led by duncan dayton and team manager rob hill did another great job of calling the right shot at the end
7436125 our car was fast all weekend but traffic was a major factor in the race i wasnt quite so lucky in some places so that hurt us a little but david did his usual charge to get the patr n highcroft acura to victory lane and now were in the thick of the championship fight
7436126 this is another fantastic team victory today and what a phenomenal race
7436127 the wheel to wheel action was as good as it gets the patr n highcroft acura was hooked up the michelin tires were performing really well and i just tried to go as fast as i could carrying speed through the corners while conserving fuel scott did a great job at the beginning of the race and the team once again delivered an excellent pit strategy i feel bad for gils team as they were so close to winning but well happily take this fourth win
7436128 i say tail lights last night in a dream about my first wife everybody leaves and id expect this much from you i say tail lights last night in a dream about my old life everybody leaves so why wouldnt you

7436133 we know for a fact a lot of localized populations have suffered dramatic declines

7436138 i just think these children are in worse shape than the american children
7436139 when families first come to us they have this vision of those little girls about 2 years old who dont have lots of issues

7436146 its hard for alternative fuels to compete with hydrocarbon fuels
7436147 this really confirms that this pattern has been happening already
7436148 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7436149 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7436150 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7436151 especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
7436152 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7436153 he does not waive us doing what we would have to do without the waiver so it doesnt change anything in the environment

7436209 the olympics have showed chinas tremendous achievements and real openness compared to 10 years ago

7436215 the fbi correctly diagnosed that mortgage fraud was epidemic but it did not come close to meeting its announced goal
7436216 it used everyday procedures and woefully inadequate resources to deal with an epidemic
7436217 the approach was certain to bring symbolic prosecutions and strategic defeat
7436218 we were dealing with the issue as best we could back then
7436219 we are feeling very strong and we dont trust anybody especially the united states
7436220 i mean who are these nations russia is probably stronger than any country in the g 8 except for the united states and it has more credibility because it hasnt killed hundreds of thousands of people recently
7436221 it has won wars and the other countries are losing them
7436222 as far as the russian elite is concerned its another very important step in russias restoration of its position in the world
7436223 the public and government is so proud not only because they defeated georgia but because they humiliated and defeated their great geopolitical rival the united states of america
7436224 moscow is very much concerned with the meddling of the united states in the post soviet space
7436225 we have been watching for a long time how the united states under the guise of helping new democracies has in fact been gaining managerial control over these countries
7436226 the governor had an obligation to raise funds for the convention and the financial obligation is tremendous
7436227 this is about civic pride for the state of colorado from our unions perspective we are supporting the democratic candidate and party and it needs to have the money to run a good convention program you cant do it in a pup tent
7436228 its not some secretive soft money slush fund because its really going to a convention
7436229 its important for him and the convention as a whole to lay out the distinctions and comparisons between himself and mccain
7436230 he needs to show that he can take off the gloves
7436231 my main goal at this convention and through my speech is to convey a sense of urgency that so many families are feeling across the country
7436232 and to present a clear choice between continuing the same economic policies and a new approach
7436233 he needs to introduce himself to voters who know him by name but not by substance
7436234 she has to get up and tell her supporters i trust sen
7436235 you cant do that in this kind of political environment with a 24 7 news cycle the internet youtube there has to be an aggressive compare and contrast
7436236 this campaign presents a very stark choice to the american people
7436237 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7436238 its a unique opportunity for candidates to focus attention on themselves and their message for four nights mostly unvarnished and unimpeded
7436239 its almost like a gateway to the real show the fall campaign
7436240 well most people dont know how to turn on the wifi security at their homes or just cant be bothered

7436259 we dont accept this claim that the traffic jam was caused because of our political programme we are constantly allowing all emergency vehicles through the durgapur expressway but we would request people to kindly bear with us during this crucial point of our movement
7436260 i listen to music the whole day whether its on the stereo the computer or my ipod
7436261 music enables an emotional level to be reached that may not be done in other modalities
7436262 living in an enriched environment allows you to develop better cognitive abilities like problem solving skills or memory skills
7436263 these pathways are now used for processing all sounds from a lions roar to a beethoven symphony allowing us to listen to music and feel incredibly moved
7436264 jeg synes det er utroligt trist for alle de aktion rer der st r tilbage og har tabt formuer p det her vi snakker jo ikke sm bel b milliarder er g et tabt
7436265 aktion rerne er blevet drevet rundt i manegen budskaberne er blevet pakket ind af en gr dig og inkompetent bestyrelse og direktion s det har v ret fuldst ndigt umuligt for aktion rerne at navigere
7436266 man m undre sig har han siddet i en campingvogn et eller andet sted nede i sydeuropa og bare stykket fingeren op i vejret og sagt vi tror den er solgt nu jeg forst r i hvert fald ikke det signal det var med til at indgyde et vist h b hos aktion rskaren som jo overhovedet ikke har v ret der
7436267 det er uheldigt at fast forrentet l n hvor perioden med afdragfrihed er forskellig er mudret sammen i n obligationsserie det er en underlig konstruktion
7436268 der har v ret rygter om at vi vil s lge vores aktier inden for et r og det er ikke sket selv om vi har f et en r kke tilbud heraf en del tilbud inden for de sidste to m neder vi har ikke solgt og det m jo sige noget om vores tro p selskabet

7436270 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
7436271 an undeniable inculpatory admission of the harvesting of falun gong practitioner prisoners for profit
7436272 caller what you used before were they from detention centers or prisons
7436273 c oh prisons and it was from healthy falun gong practitioners the healthy falun gong right
7436274 lg right right right we would choose the good ones because we will assure the quality of our operations
7436275 i told her the caller i was not involved in the surgical operations and had no idea where the organs come from i told her i could not answer her questions she then asked me whether these organs come from prisons i replied no to her in clear cut terms
7436276 so here we have on our recording an admission from a doctor that he and his colleagues used to go to a prison to select falun gong practitioners for their organs he does not just say that someone else did this he says that he and his colleagues used to do this themselves moreover we have a further admission that the voice we have on our recording is the voice of the very person our recording says he is
7436277 it has the sanction of the government of china the admission is accordingly one which is sanctioned and approved by the government of china and can not credibly be denied by the government

7436285 jeg husker forl bet som meget mystisk faktisk tror jeg ikke at der var nogen af os som r g hjem der egentlig forstod hvad der foregik det hele gik meget st rkt mindes henrik flach
7436286 der l en telefonbesked om at jeg skulle ringe hjem
7436287 klokken var fem minutter i seks samtalen var relativt kort jeg blev informeret om at ministeren klokken seks ville g p tv og fort lle om beslutningen der var ikke s meget andet at g re end at sige javel pakke og komme hjem vi er jo ansat i forsvaret og vi g r loyalt hvad man beder os om men joh det var da en relativt kort lunte
7436288 det var ret kaotisk med mange journalister der ringede hele tiden i virkeligheden kunne jeg ikke fort lle dem s meget jeg forstod ikke hvorfor vi var blevet taget hjem men jeg vidste da at jeg syntes det var forkert generelt fors gte jeg bare at v re ben og svare rligt p alle sp rgsm l men det var da en h rd tid ikke mindst for min familie
7436289 der var masser af klap p skulderen folk der sagde at vi bare skulle blive ved og at vi gjorde det godt det var dejligt med den opbakning
7436290 jeg havde meget sv rt ved at forholde mig til den sigtelse
7436291 for jeg vidste jo med sikkerhed at vi ikke havde gjort noget forkert der var ingen sag
7436292 nej selvf lgelig ville jeg gerne have v ret sagen foruden og dialogen kunne da have v ret bedre men jeg nsker ikke at pege fingre det kommer der sj ldent noget godt ud af jeg tror ikke at nogen bevidst beg r fejl
7436293 jeg m da indr mme at jeg fandt det interessant da hels fhv forsvarschef jesper hels red i et afskedsinterview udtalte at han var ked af den her sag nu ved alle der p den ene eller anden facon var involveret at forsvarschefen fortryder sagen og det er vigtigt

7436826 what was the best thing that happened to you today
7436827 the funeral was 6 500 i donated 500 to the church the wake food and drinks were another 500 the rest went for the memorial stone
7436828 you deserve so much better in a relationship to what you have now
7436829 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7436830 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7436831 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7436832 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7436833 its been a blessing for me to be out on this court
7436834 when you put on this jersey you know the tradition thats expected
7436835 they dont hope you live up to it they expect you to live up to it and thats winning the gold medal
7436836 ill probably catch up on a lot of sleep the next few days
7436837 it felt really good to be the world champions especially since i made the last out
7436838 we are the second place team in the world we should be happy we wanted to win so bad
7436839 i got stymied behind the tree and i got lucky because i got a drop because of some gopher holes or whatever it was
7436840 it wasnt where my ball was but like about 5 or 6 feet left it was actually moving you could see the grass going up and down it was actually there and we were trying to find it but we couldnt
7436841 i just wanted to know why he got a drop there was obviously a mole there and he was burrowing at that moment you could see him popping out i was really focused on what i was doing
7436842 westchester was a good golf course this tops westchester every single player out there absolutely enjoyed this golf course
7436843 i was surprised to see it go in he was even more surprised to see mine go in
7436844 its hard to see your friend not win especially if hes playing against you but somebody has to win
7436845 lonely no i have to stay plugged in for 90 minutes
7436846 if that means i dont touch the ball for 89 minutes and have to make one big save thats ok
7436847 nothing too threatening not that we threatened a lot ourselves we had our chance and we stuck it it makes a big difference to be up going into halftime you change your tactics
7436848 and came in hard at my feet it happened so fast
7436849 were trying to work on where to go where to play the ball little details
7436850 last year i came on crutches but i worked hard and got back youve got to do it ill work day in and day out for these girls until my death if i have to
7436851 this team has come a long way and we had a lot of blowouts those first few games
7436852 so it was fitting that this one would be a close one it really tested us to see what we were all about and in the end we showed were the best in the world
7436853 it was more teamwork probably well directed by their coaching staff
7436854 if it wasnt for the determination and the willpower that we have in each other we wouldnt have pulled through and gotten this win
7436855 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7436856 he goes out and you know youre going to get a quality start
7436857 well know more as the week goes on ua coach mike stoops said
7436858 were all a little bit unsure right now hopefully its cured as quickly as possible well see
7436859 he has been one of our more consistent guys out there but its what you do with a football team someone else has to step up and a j has done some good things this camp
7436860 we may change our sets and what we feature may change
7436861 whatever our best 11 are for every given situation we have a lot of flexibility
7436862 unfortunately he is behind robbie right now but he can be a very important player for us a j could probably start for almost any team in the pac 10
7436863 i think the coaching staff has done a good job of preparing me for something like this simmons said
7436864 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was real mad
7436865 we wanted to play much better to open up the stadium but it didnt happen they outplayed us tonight
7436866 offensively we didnt have a lot of rhythm but we didnt have the ball a lot
7436867 in the second half we had a chance to get back in it but the turnovers really took the wind out of our sails
7436868 he handled the information we got in and out it was a noisy game and it could have been noisier but we got off to that good start
7436869 the touchdown was a plus but it could have been a whole lot better
7436870 weve got to get back to protecting the ball like the colts normally do
7436871 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7436872 she said you won you won you won nothing else to say there just listening to each other smile on the phone
7436873 the best thing they could do was play great volleyball they cant control what had happened and probably are going to try to comprehend the magnitude of that event later but what we can do is try to play the best we can
7436874 i thought that was a real good way for them to deal with it im very proud of their approach and their maturity
7436875 nobody likes to reverse one and ive been involved with some in pretty big situations like that but when you get the call right everyones behind you the media and the teams on the field
7436876 obviously a third catcher is important another pitcher who can give you some length is important another pinch hitter off the bench particularly right handed maybe another infielder
7436877 the thing is they have confidence in me so that sometimes when the starter has men on base they think im the guy
7436878 im not complaining about it im ready for whatever they want me to do
7436879 physically he is fine but hes probably not having his greatest at bats
7436880 its just a coincidence that its bobble day for me that it happened but its nice to have that many fans out there and win a ball game like that
7436881 i was planning on swinging at that fastball but i saw rickie take off so i figured id take it let him get to second scoring position
7436882 split finger i think he hung it a little bit and it found a hole for me
7436883 you just had the feeling getting out of that jam right there we were going to win the ball game in the bottom half of the inning
7436884 the way the game was going the flow of the game i made my mind up that if we had a runner in scoring position i was going to take a shot at trying to score that run for him and hold it to see if he could get the win
7436885 both sides left a lot of guys on base a lot of hits we just couldnt come up with the big one
7436886 bob continued to agitate the situation by coming toward our dugout and yelling
7436887 they were exchanging words we got adam pushed him down the dugout and he stopped talking and bob kept coming i didnt think it was handled right
7436888 everything that you get in this game youve earned whether it be a touchdown a win whatever it is
7436889 in some sense it is satisfying in that light but trust me theres a lot of work ahead and i know that probably just as much as everybody around here theres going to be some ups and downs but youve just got to stay mentally tough and grind through it thats where my mind set is right now
7436890 we feel like he gives us the best chance to win
7436891 hes picked up our system ill have to keep repeating this but its a learning curve for a quarterback in this league hes going to see some things he hasnt seen before but i think matt is the kind of guy who might get fooled once but the next time it comes up hes going to be able to handle it i really anticipate that we wont see the gaffes that a lot of people think
7436892 he just shook it off and said im glad i got that one out of the way in the preseason
7436893 hes got a very good outlook about the game of football hes got a good understanding to play quarterback in this league hes prepared for it hes mature beyond his years and itll be a great season for him to come in and be out leader
7436894 hes going to have his growing pains just like anybody
7436895 you look at peyton manning in his first year he struggled i just hope the fans and the media give this guy a chance hes not going to go out there and be a hall of famer every game this year hes going to have some mistakes and were going to help him out as much as possible
7436896 i am looking forward to trying some new events some events ive never really had the opportunity to swim since my schedule is always so crowded
7436897 im used to playing in front of big crowds on big stages basically what i want to do is play hard and be disciplined and execute our game plan i think the teams ready its going to be a great opportunity for us to go out and show what we can do on a big stage
7436898 the pressure is to go out and win thats the pressure
7436899 im going to play within the system and play within the game plan and try to make plays when the opportunities present themselves
7436900 is when you step into something youre not prepared for
7436901 this is probably one of my worst races this year and just compound that with the fact that these are the olympics and these are all the best riders in the world all trying to do their best for today and its a tough course and it was hot
7436902 so a lot of little things kind of led to my withdrawal
7436903 i knew right away i wasnt good and i was hoping that i would kind of ride through it and the legs would start to come around later on but it just didnt happen
7436904 sometimes you have good legs and youre good that day and other days you dont have it and when you dont have it its hard to really do anything differently when youre going as hard as you can and youre in the lead its a lot easier mentally than when youre struggling back in the 20s or 30s
7436905 i was hoping to have a good race and i didnt
7436906 but im still pumped to be here and be part of the olympics youve got to look for the bright side of things coming here its been awesome it just feels incredible to be out here and be a part of it
7436907 in kenya we have many medals but im glad i have this one
7436908 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
7436909 i think he definitely didnt have his best day against me but playing him nine times i guess hes bound to have one off day out of all of them because there are times when i felt like there was nothing i could do
7436910 the goal is still the same and the pressure is still the same
7436911 the goal is to continue to improve my tennis and to continue playing a very good tournament
7436912 some people may think this is a harsh decision but one thing i do know is the little things if you forget about them they add up to big things and they cause a lot of problems for your team
7436913 i messed up so its best for the team and im here for them
7436914 this is an opportunity for me to prove myself and showcase my skills and showcase my leadership so thats how im looking at it
7436915 robert marve will be the starter we will not have a controversy if a guy like jacory can go in and have a tremendous game robert marve still will be the starter we have to build depth at that position

7436987 to be very sincere i think a lot of nigerians and people all over africa imagined that he obama was going to nominate hilary clinton this basically as a result of many factors one of which is the tradition in american politics where you have very serious competition in party primaries the winner normally carries along the loser so that they can forge a common front reassure the unity of the party and party members with a view to facing the opponent in general election
7436988 i agree with you that most likely senator obama must have considered the integrity the political credentials as well as other factors in nominating his running mate but the choice in nigeria was not exactly the same thing because here was a very contrite agenda where the primary itself was not free and fair where the sitting president unilaterally decided who was an aspirant and at the end of it after the presidential candidate was nominated the issue of running mate was announced from the presidential villa so it was not a free political intercourse
7436989 there is the regional issue there is the ethnic issue theres also the religious issue and in the case of goodluck jonathan i think one of the most fundamental consideration had to do with the niger delta crisis especially if we place it within the spectrum of the aggression and the violence that has been taking place by either the youth of the region and those who desire to steal oil from the region
7436990 we are perturbed at the lack of interest by city management in cleaning up vacant buildings
7436991 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

7437085 wow im not sure i could go through this and still want to run
7437086 this is the highest thing any athlete can hope for it has been a very happy experience for me i am proud to bring the somali flag to fly with all of these countries and to stand with the best athletes in the world
7437087 there is no money for facilities or training the war the security the difficulties with food and everything there are just many other internal difficulties to deal with
7437088 when we went back home my friends and i were rounded up and we were told if we did it again we would get killed some of my friends stopped being in sports i had many phone calls threatening me that if i didnt stop running i would get killed lately i do not have these problems i think probably they realized we just wanted to be athletes and were not involved with the government
7437089 the food is not something that is measured and given to us every day
7437090 the stadiums i never thought something like this existed in the world
7437091 the buildings in the city it was all very surprising it will probably take days to finish all the stories we have to tell
7437092 i didnt know what it was when i saw it
7437093 the olympic fire in the stadium everywhere i am it is always up there
7437094 its like the moon i look up wherever i go it is there
7437095 the good thing sports is the one thing which unites all of somalia
7437096 because of us the somali flag is raised among all the other nations flags you cant imagine how proud we were when we were marching in the opening ceremonies with the flag
7437097 despite the difficulties and everything weve had with our country we feel great pride in our accomplishment
7437098 i was happy the people were cheering and encouraging me
7437099 but i would have liked to be cheered because i won not because i needed encouragement it is something i will work on i will try my best not to be the last person next time it was very nice for people to give me that encouragement but i would prefer the winning cheer
7437100 we know that we are different from the other athletes
7437101 but we dont want to show it we try our best to look like all the rest we understand we are not anywhere near the level of the other competitors here we understand that very very well but more than anything else we would like to show the dignity of ourselves and our country

7437107 reproductive dysfunctions include a range of menstrual disorders sexual dysfunctions and pregnancy complications that include spontaneous abortion or miscarriage

7437109 higher rates of reproductive dysfunction in adult women may reflect the cumulative effects of longer exposure to alcohol for older women than for female adolescents
7437110 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohols effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development most previous research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk associated with ad in women that is not widely recognized a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly young women

7437167 i venture that of all the subtle sins we will address in this book the pride of moral superiority may be the most common second only to the sin of ungodliness but though it is so prevalent among us it is difficult to recognize because we all practice it to some degree in fact we seem to get a perverse enjoyment out of discussing how awful society around us is becoming when we engage in this kind of thinking or conversation we are guilty of the pride of moral superiority

7437304 as a candidate who wants to transcend race obama treads very lightly with respect to tapping into that tradition
7437305 there is this dialogue on the meaning of american democracy
7437306 and you see people commenting and taking their cues from earlier speeches that dealt with how do you make democracy real
7437307 king was obviously drawing on abraham lincolns gettysburg address and engaging in a dialogue with thomas jefferson on whats the meaning of the declaration of independence and on other occasions drawing on frederick douglass and his fourth of july speech in 1852
7437308 use some of kings phrasing the same way that king used some of lincolns phrasing
7437309 but he doesnt spring out of a vacuum he comes from a tradition of great speechmakers going back a very long time
7437310 oratory in the 19th century was the television of today
7437311 this was a way of conveying social issues and the problems of the day to the populace black or white
7437312 the leading light in african american political and social life until his death
7437313 brought to the discussion of slavery great analytical powers and also a very powerful way of speaking
7437314 this fourth of july is yours not mine to drag a man in fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty and call upon him to join you in joyous anthems were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony
7437315 is part of the african american oratorical tradition which obama is certainly aware of
7437316 foreshadows martin luther kings speech about being judged on the content of the character and not the color of the skin

7437320 methinks there are no chains so galling as the chains of ignorance no fetters so binding as those that bind the soul and exclude it from the vast field of useful and scientific knowledge
7437321 what to the american slave is your 4th of july i answer a day that reveals to him more than all other days in the year the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim to him your celebration is a sham your boasted liberty an unholy license your national greatness swelling vanity your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless your denunciation of tyrants brass fronted impudence your shouts of liberty and equality hollow mockery your prayers and hymns your sermons and thanksgivings with all your religious parade and solemnity are to him mere bombast fraud deception impiety and hypocrisy a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages there is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of the united states at this very hour
7437322 the nation has begun its exodus from worse than egyptian bondage and i beseech you that you say to the people that they go forward with the assurance of gods favor in all things done in obedience to his righteous will and guided by day and by night by the pillars of cloud and fire let us not pause until we have reached the other and safe side of the stormy and crimson sea let freemen and patriots mete out complete and equal justice to all men and thus prove to mankind the superiority of our democratic republican government
7437323 though we are not white we have accomplished much we have pioneered civilization here we have built up your country we have worked in your fields and garnered your harvests for two hundred and fifty years and what do we ask of you in return do we ask you for compensation for the sweat our fathers bore for you for the tears you have caused and the hearts you have broken and the lives you have curtailed and the blood you have spilled do we ask for retaliation we ask it not we are willing to let the dead past bury its dead but we ask you now for our rights you may expel us gentlemen but i firmly believe that you will some day repent it
7437324 the unanimity with which the colored voters act with a party is not referable to any race prejudice on their part on the contrary they invite the political cooperation of their white brethren and vote as a unit because proscribed as such they deprecate the establishment of the color line by the opposition not only because the act is unwise and wrong in principle but because it isolates them from the white men of the south and forces them in sheer self protection and against their inclination to act seemingly upon the basis of a race prejudice that they neither respect nor entertain as a class they are free from prejudices and have no uncharitable suspicions against their white fellow citizens whether native born or settlers from the northern states they not only recognize the equality of citizenship and the right of every man to hold without proscription any position of honor and trust to which the confidence of the people may elevate him but owing nothing to race birth or surroundings they above all other classes in the community are interested to see prejudices drop out of both politics and the business of the country and success in life proceed only upon the integrity and merit of the man who seeks it

7437387 he had lost all hope after a series of failures and took his anger out on society

7437420 all the players i know personally from other countries have expressed their concerns in terms of safety and security it was good that this decision was taken out of our players hands
7437421 over the last couple of weeks it has been a huge topic of conversation in the dressing room
7437422 and last sundays briefing was a huge talking point this whole week there has been ifs and buts and dos and donts
7437423 what was said was said behind closed doors in terms of who did and who didnt
7437424 i dont want to say anything about what was said in that situation we spoke to the board and they made their recommendations when they reported back to the icc
7437425 what i said to the team was to put it to the back of our minds because the most important thing for us is the one day series with south africa and that means standing up to be counted on tuesday
7437426 this is a huge decision and cricket can now take priority again
7437427 the ecb board made it clear to icc chief executive haroon lorgat at a meeting at lords last week that ecb had a duty of care for england players and officials as well as a desire to ensure the interests of the media and spectators were not compromised
7437428 the ecb explained their reservations and security concerns about staging the tournament in the aftermath of the resignation of the pakistan president pervez musharraf last monday
7437429 these concerns were shared by four other competing countries at the teleconference
7437430 the ecb board recognises the outstanding efforts of the pakistan cricket board in attempting to mitigate the risks surrounding the champions trophy tournament and i will be meeting with the incoming chairman of the pcb once an appointment is made to discuss ways that our two boards can work together in the future
7437431 educations purpose is to replace an empty mind with an open one
7437432 i said to him i really wanted to do this too and he said oh mate im on a mission a really big mission
7437433 i believe he will maintain the sense of solid character that is needed to ensure he and his colleague get through this
7437434 he was in scotland and i was in india we hadnt talked for about two months so it was a jovial catch up between friends
7437435 this was his passion to go and do this sort of work
7437436 he knew the consequences but he was a very strong person so the chances of him coming home are very strong i would say
7437437 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalised in ecclesiastical life
7437438 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7437439 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7437440 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7437441 its an initiative that belittles the role of nuns who have dedicated themselves to god

7437443 los pueblos ind genas no nos vamos a callar hasta lograr un verdadero cambio
7437444 los grandes efectos de los cambios clim ticos no son producto de los seres humanos en general sino del sistema capitalista vigente inhumano con desarrollo industrial ilimitado por eso siento que es importante acabar con la explotaci n a los seres humanos y acabar con el saqueo de los recursos naturales
7437445 si se quiere salvar el planeta hay que terminar y erradicar al modelo capitalista y lograr que el norte pague la deuda ecol gica en vez de que los pa ses del sur y de todo el mundo paguen la deuda externa

7437557 because the fraudsters make a special point of calling consumers repeatedly at work employers must understand that the consumers are innocent victims of a criminal enterprise and cannot stop the calls from coming i also wish to assure the citizens of west virginia that my office will continue to do everything possible to locate and shut down the outlaw debt collectors

7437879 there is some worry that i might be a lightning rod
7437880 some of it is because i challenged the system at guant namo
7437881 i can see why muslims wanted to go underground after 9 11
7437882 but i have found that if you speak up in politics you can have a positive influence
7437883 by far the strongest advocate for following the geneva conventions for habeas corpus for following the constitution for everyone and for reaching out to all faiths
7437884 that theyll now read from the quran at a national political convention that shows we have come a long way in this country
7437885 its hard to take im heartbroken for the lads because weve given everything and deserved more
7437886 we were disciplined and gave them a lot of problems were incredibly down because we would have been disappointed with a point
7437887 we continue to prefer to work together with you and your board to complete a negotiated transaction and we are prepared to commit all necessary resources to do so
7437888 if we are unable to negotiate a transaction we are prepared to take this offer directly to your stockholders
7437889 it adds a nice bit of diversification to kings portfolio at the end of the day
7437890 it was interesting when we screened the film for some of the parents and the kids
7437891 the parents were really moved they had no idea the kids were thinking those thoughts it just goes to show that if you take the time and pay attention and if youre quiet enough you hear things
7437892 cel mai bine cel mai frumos este c nd taurii atac sau se joac atunci c nd po i ntr adev r s faci ceva cu taurii
7437893 at what age can we really start using the jogging stroller for jogging the folks who work at the running store are well kinda macho about it we started when she was 2 months old and the books literature online sometimes say as late as 8 months
7437894 at that point the head will not bounce around and there will be minimal danger of the kinds of acceleration deceleration that might cause injury
7437895 my goodness what sort of world have i brought you into
7437896 rick i fought for your pay raise but you know human resources makes those decisions
7437897 in every serious negotiation the man or woman who doesnt care is going to win
7437898 starwreck easily generated more than 10 times return the numbers are small but the cost 20 000 was minimal as well
7437899 and when your movie costs only 20k to make you dont need to have an audience of millions or tens of millions to reach your goals but if you spent a hundred million on the production the expectations for the size of the audience grows too
7437900 we have nothing against the technology we just dont want that delivery system
7437901 they seem to think our community is their open job site
7437902 if we were going to have our landscape dotted with refrigerator size boxes we should have some control over them
7437903 we asked them to move certain locations and they voluntarily did
7437904 its a little silly for apple to set it up this way
7437905 the reality is if youre on the internet youre open to spamming anyway and this is just one more way for spammers to get your e mail address
7437906 the encryption issue to me is far more serious and apple should give it a higher priority to fix
7437907 cios have to align it with their corporate strategy to get higher returns
7437908 ive learned to deal with the attitude that romance is simple
7437909 there are days when your only contact with a person is your spouse but i do have an online community of people also in their pjs at home
7437910 i was one of those kids in school who didnt say much i learned how to talk to people from my husband
7437911 people want an escape for the bad things in life
7437912 you know in the end of a romance novel justice will prevail
7437913 its a lot of work people tend to think its a piece of cake that you could sit down and write a romance novel in a week
7437914 anything shes tackled in her life shes just went at it with no holds barred with the idea that she will achieve the best she could

7437920 discontent over the failure of our political system is rampant throughout our citizenry
7437921 it is in this gathering of discontent that my candidacy intends to find its voice
7437922 we wonder why it is that blue collar workers who come from a heritage that is the democratic party began to leave it its because we really dont respect them
7437923 hes a happy warrior he loves the whole thing but hell punch you out
7437924 nobody has as many ties in the foreign policy establishment as joe does
7437925 become a great pantomime where the standard of judgment is no longer real results but the flickering image of seriousness skillfully crafted to squeeze into a 30 second spot have a problem we have an answer but rarely a solution
7437926 im not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer albeit these people have clearly stolen intellectual property i think there are better ways of resolving this within our power as developers and publishers
7437927 we absolutely should crack down on piracy people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their content and deserve to get paid for it its absolutely wrong it is stealing but at the same time i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games
7437928 we decided to use planes to cover a larger area along with firing rain dispersal rockets from the ground
7437929 heritage learners or speakers of a language in addition to english have always been multiplying in this country because its built on immigration and you come here with a different language if you immigrate
7437930 the 1990 and 2000 censuses have shown huge increases of immigration in the past 15 to 16 years
7437931 so we get a lot of children who have this wonderful knowledge from home of another language and they come to school but the teaching methodology is not right for them
7437932 the goal of our heritage language programs is to have multiple programs programs like persian arabic russian chinese because there are a lot of immigrants from these countries
7437933 second generation immigrants are eager to learn their home countrys language
7437934 we are beginning to move toward high school because its important to start enforcing the language early
7437935 ideally you would start learning the language as early as possible so that while young students are using english in school they can also study their own language
7437936 i think uclas goal is to get students familiar with the campus and college life prior to beginning college
7437937 and we want younger students to grow familiar with their language
7437938 in the beginning i did feel a little more jitters than i did in the first round
7437939 i had to kind of shake them off i knew i needed to react to the gun just focus on me and be quick and attack each hurdle
7437940 it was really touch and go there for a while thankfully sanya richards ran a great anchor leg and brought us back to win the gold
7437941 all our young ladies did an excellent job it just shows the heart and soul they have i was proud of them they ran with so much heart they wanted to show american were doing fine and we have more medals than we have had in a while
7437942 i cant speak for all the other deans but as you can imagine as the state moves to reduce its support for public universities we have to look for other financial options like scholarships
7437943 we need to find other venues beyond just the state and i see my role as the cheerleader to hopefully bring resources to the school
7437944 im really excited to see what direction hell take the school in i think he has a really challenging opportunity with dean cowans passing
7437945 were advised to give it to the medalist as a gift
7437946 there are amazing comic performers around the world and there are fans who want to see them we saw an opportunity to deliver that service
7437947 but we are not saying you have to come to rooftop we will find you where you are
7437948 in the beginning it was about single clip videos but now the mainstream content has come online and there is an expectation for quality
7437949 one of the challenges we all have now is that the web audience has adult attention deficit disorder and moves around quickly a company that draws audience by creating a destination will win the video war
7437950 its all about creating tv like experience the advertisers need to be able to predict frequency which allows brands to build the presence with viewers
7437951 creating a virtual cycle between watching tv and online so they are complementary is the future of the industry
7437952 its very empowering for our fans to know that there are tens of thousands of people watching the show at the same time
7437953 right now we are talking about pc and tv but soon every device will have a potential for video your photo frame will stream videos from grandmas visit or broadcast the weather channel
7437954 pretty soon the idea of tv sitting in the living room will disappear
7437955 todays wi fi handoff protocols are incredibly fragile in outdoor environments and mobile environments
7437956 artificially limited to talking to only one access point or only one base station at a time even though there may be other base stations
7437957 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
7437958 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country
7437959 after 2000 everyone thought you could throw a bunch of money at the problem and make it go away right away elections aint that kind of thing

7437962 unser volk hat alles nur m gliche getan um seine unabh ngigkeit in strikter bereinstimmung mit dem v lkerrecht zu erlangen
7437963 its important for him and the convention as a whole to lay out the distinctions and comparisons between himself and mccain
7437964 he needs to show that he can take off the gloves
7437965 my main goal at this convention and through my speech is to convey a sense of urgency that so many families are feeling across the country
7437966 and to present a clear choice between continuing the same economic policies and a new approach
7437967 he needs to introduce himself to voters who know him by name but not by substance
7437968 she has to get up and tell her supporters i trust sen
7437969 you cant do that in this kind of political environment with a 24 7 news cycle the internet youtube there has to be an aggressive compare and contrast
7437970 this campaign presents a very stark choice to the american people
7437971 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7437972 its a unique opportunity for candidates to focus attention on themselves and their message for four nights mostly unvarnished and unimpeded
7437973 its almost like a gateway to the real show the fall campaign
7437974 the olympics have showed chinas tremendous achievements and real openness compared to 10 years ago
7437975 the olympics has made us feel more lenient toward the outside world
7437976 i hope the country can now move beyond the century of shame and humiliation thinking and ditch all that stuff in its psyche for the past 60 years
7437977 we have a film that plays to a broad audience and one that perhaps bears repeat viewing
7437978 its the only comedy for this demographic for the summer
7437979 this is in line with how his movies do its an intriguing film
7437980 comedy is ruling the box office and audiences are showing theyre in the mood to have a good time
7437981 in 1969 my husband jimmy george and i relocated to lafayette la
7437982 i was one of five white teachers in a totally black school and part of the reason we were there was to help the students get used to white teachers the following year all of the students were going to be bused to other schools in lafayette and paul breaux was to be closed
7437983 these people were actually losing the heart of their community i learned about the families their hopes and their dreams their fears
7437984 it was a very emotional time for the students it opened my eyes to so many things the civil rights movement empathy with the families and the fact that i was in the minority for the first time in my life i was out of my comfort zone trying to understand another culture
7437985 that was the year that made me the person and the educator that i am today when i meet with students now im truly able to relate with a lot of diverse people and understand their points of view because of that year
7437986 my most memorable year would be my very first year but not for the traditional reasons most people tell about the long hours and chaos my experience was a lot more positive than that it was in the state of north carolina the school district in jacksonville and about 10 miles out was the tight knit community of richland n c the students all walked to school there and it was quite different from an inner city district ten or 15 years separated me from the other teachers there and they nurtured me i just bonded with those kids i even went back to north carolina for their graduation the next most memorable year was when i started teaching in august of 2001 at meacham middle school here in fort worth on the north side and i taught there until 2007 in my experience there were some years more difficult than others there but i jell really well with that age group and because of that first year in north carolina and the nurturing of the teachers i knew how to build a respectful relationship and a good rapport with them thats all ive ever taught or wanted to teach middle school and math there are many strengths that middle school students come with and some deficiencies as with all students its ok if they like you but not if you let them get away with anything ive been in administration for a year as a middle school math specialist and a teacher on assignment its a philosophical change but all kids can learn and its still my job to figure out how one thing ive observed in the fort worth isd is were improving teaching techniques the way i was nurtured and holding students to high standards we want to better prepare students as thinkers and prepare them for high school
7437987 its snippets of every year that mean the most to me so my most memorable year would be this past year its those teachable moments that make it worthwhile and there were quite a few

7438036 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in
7438037 this is very much a personal view at this stage
7438038 if we want to retain our position as a constructive eu member state we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
7438039 mr roche is not calling for a second referendum to be put

7438050 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
7438051 but we dont sit here cowed by anything weve seen
7438052 we have been dazzled we have been impressed we have been blown away by these beijing games but we have not been intimidated and in our own sweet way without wasting tax payers money i am convinced that we can do just as well in 2012
7438053 i think we accept that it is unlikely you will see a games on this size and scale and stature again
7438054 the ioc in 2001 reached the conclusions that the focus must be much more on sustainability that big is not necessarily better
7438055 beijing has been very good the venues were superb the planning was clearly in place we knew the city would dress for a games embrace the biggest show on earth
7438056 but i like to think that london had it not already been the iocs blueprint would have instinctively got there to remain relevant the games must go on providing benefits long after the show has left town
7438057 there is no possible justification for leaving a second 80 000 seater stadium in london
7438058 the temporary nature of over 55 000 of those seats built on five rings means you can be very creative the way you wrap it with moving images its actually very exciting for us
7438059 it will be under pinned by all the security you expect but also recognising that we want this to be a celebration in our own back yard thats the balance you are always striking

7438063 with that much money sitting in the accounts of tag providers the system should be free of maintenance costs
7438064 it sort of slipped through and no one pointed it out of course they the nra wouldnt have pointed it out because its not in their interest this whole thing is just a fiasco its taxes by stealth
7438065 a big man makes an easier target sure well give him a few slaps and see how he goes on after that
7438066 the whole arse has fallen out of it now to be honest i know an olympic silver medal is brilliant and all but i thought i had the beatings of the guy olympic silver medallists are very rare i am proud to be irish proud to have a silver medal but its always nice to get the gold the score is the score i have to settle for silver im disgusted but thats sport there has to be a loser
7438067 i told him he to go out and throw as many punches as he could he had to keep working he had to hunt him down and try to score which isnt kennys game but he had to chase him and dig out every score
7438068 because he had been hitting him with good right hooks and good left hands to the body and he wasnt getting scores for them
7438069 for the team it has been a fantastic performance throughout
7438070 everybody performed they gave their all for the country at home with all the doom and gloom the weather and the recession well hopefully we put a smile on peoples faces

7438073 he did the catharsis interview on oprah this past may which was the smart thing to do and put all that behind him he has thick skin you dont get to be his age and his success level without taking some hits without having some purple hearts
7438074 he has always been willing to take chances in his career and what he did in the movie was amazing to me he has a great sense of humor and his work elevated the picture
7438075 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people
7438076 of course its possible to prepare a forecast with any lead time you like whether or nor that forecast has any accuracy or usable skill is another question

7438098 there should be an opportunity for students to be educated about alcohol and right now we cant do it in good conscience we have to tell students that its illegal to drink but if you are going to drink this is how you should do it that is a mix message to send students
7438099 the 21 year old age limit does not prevent binge drinking it happens in campuses across the country and i think if we were able to show responsible drinking and modeled responsible drinking and we educate students about it would be very beneficial for everybody
7438100 i support this initiative because it will allow our colleges to engage in real education of our students about responsible use of alcohol as well as model moderate behavior at present we are constrained only to talk about abstinence since anything else is against the law treating college students as adults will help them to make more responsible decisions
7438101 speakers like bill clinton and justice antonin scalia dropped by last spring and neither was tarred and feathered
7438102 released in 2007 has been adopted at several prestigious colleges including harvard and claremont mckenna it has yet to make a dent in the wider textbook market
7438103 in march 2003 registered nurse jill stanek submitted a statement to the illinois senate health and human services committee in which she reported that infants who survived abortions at her oak lawn hospital were sometimes
7438104 you should know that when jaffa was retired federal law required that professors retire at age 70 starks hand were tied
7438105 a college with which i am affiliated discovered that its alma mater was written for a blackface minstrel show in the 1900s although the lyrics are innocuous the school banned the song from this years graduation and formed a group to discuss its future use part of a campaign to make students aware of things they take for granted is this a good response or should the school focus on more important issues is it unethical to sing the song
7438106 the schools response is not only ethical but also admirable
7438107 the athena factor reversing the brain drain in science engineering and technology
7438108 dedicated to promoting policies that enable individuals to realize their full potential across the divides of gender race and class
7438109 once and for all we must recognize that the heart and soul of discrimination the last refuge of the bigot is to say that those who are discriminated against deserve it because they are less good
7438110 started to collect evidence that their male peers had received a disproportionate heres that word again share of laboratory space and resources for research
7438111 arise from particular religious and political strains remote from western experience
7438112 illusion that danger may be abolished through successful diplomatic negotiations or by achieving a balance of armed forces
7438113 the split is a much profounder and more alienating one
7438114 thus we already have three worlds undoubtedly however the number is even greater we are just too far away to see
7438115 vast regions everywhere on our planet should develop and mature to the level of present day western systems
7438116 may be the most striking feature which an outside observer notices in the west in our days the western world has lost its civic courage
7438117 technical and social progress has permitted the realization of such aspirations the majority of people have been granted well being to an extent their fathers and grandfathers could not even dream about an almost unlimited freedom of enjoyment
7438118 is only a question of the good organization of the state the problem of organizing a state however hard it may seem can be solved even for a race of devils
7438119 ambition must be made to counteract ambition the interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place
7438120 policy of supplying by opposite and rival interests the defect of better motives
7438121 i have spent all my life under a communist regime and i will tell you that a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed
7438122 but a society with no other scale but the legal one is not quite worthy of man either
7438123 tilt of freedom in the direction of evil has come about gradually it was evidently born primarily out of a humanistic and benevolent concept according to which there is no evil inherent in human nature the world belongs to mankind and all the defects of life are caused by wrong social systems which must be corrected
7438124 everything beyond physical well being and accumulation of material goods all other human requirements and characteristics of a subtler and higher nature are left outside the range of attention of the state and the social system
7438125 the very basis of human thinking in the past centuries
7438126 rationalistic humanism or humanistic autonomy the proclaimed and enforced autonomy of man from any higher force above him
7438127 we are now experiencing the consequences of mistakes which had not been noticed at the beginning of the journey
7438128 on the way from the renaissance to our days we have enriched our experience but he have lost the concept of a supreme compete entity which used to restrain our passions and our irresponsibility
7438129 the split in the world is less terrible than the fact that the same disease plagues its two main sections
7438130 it is imperative to review the table of widespread human values
7438131 intolerable despotic repression of mans physical nature in favor of the spiritual one
7438132 we shall have to rise to a new height of vision to a new level of life where our physical nature will not be cursed as in the middle ages but even more importantly our spiritual being will not be trampled upon as in the modern era
7438133 just because i am a friend to i dare to say these things about democracy
7438134 dick snyder was running s and s back then and he really did believe in the free market of ideas
7438135 i was pretty much free to acquire anyone i wanted
7438136 i brought them books by bill buckley and charles kessler
7438137 and also sidney hook who was hardly a conservative but felt like one to the lefties at harper but of course they were names every time i brought up someone they hadnt heard of they would say no brad we want to do conservative books just not this one there really was no conception of the size of the potential market or what the country was like it was like the famous steinberg drawing with new york as the center of the world that odd liberal version of reality
7438138 the tour of world capitals and hot spots represented a test that was necessary to pass it looks as if hes done far better than just passing hes aced this tour if there was any doubt of his stature on the world stage i think hes more than answered that he hasnt put a foot wrong in any of these places
7438139 it was this spirit that led airlift planes to appear in the sky above our heads
7438140 at first truman was almost alone in thinking that an airlift would work as an effective response to the soviets
7438141 trailblazer in pursuit of oil the re opening of azerbaijan to the west
7438142 the tour of world capitals and hot spots represented a test that was necessary to pass it looks as if hes done far better than just passing hes aced this tour if there was any doubt of his stature on the world stage i think hes more than answered that he hasnt put a foot wrong in any of these places
7438143 so how come at freshmen orientation they taught us about petty worries like stds and alcohol but not how to survive real peril namely earthquakes
7438144 theres nothing in any of these data that would suggest that girls cant do math or arent doing well in math
7438145 age 41 he mathematically could be the grandson of a perpetrator of the armenian genocide instead hes armed with rhetorical skills a smile and turkish government talking points and propaganda
7438146 the role and challenges of turkey in a globalizing world
7438147 he initially said some of the students were being harassed
7438148 i asked you to voluntarily remove your video from youtube because you had no authority to publish it i explained that you needed to obtain for starters the students consent before doing so
7438149 as a result of a third party notification by claremont graduate university claiming that this material is infringing
7438150 i dont see any legal basis to request student faces to be blurred based on the facts as i understand them
7438151 the web site i paid for it to be up for a year
7438152 i didnt want all the art to pile up on me
7438153 the knowledge of individuals taken as a whole is far greater than that of any commission or board however diligent and expert the magic of the system of prices and of economic markets is that they incorporate a great deal of diffuse knowledge
7438154 a government that is unlimited in scope but formless in action
7438155 it looks as if hes done far better than just passing
7438156 if there was any doubt of his stature on the world stage i think hes more than answered that he hasnt put a foot wrong in any of these places
7438157 that puts bill clinton in a terrible bind because you cant give a ringing endorsement when youre talking about foreign policy
7438158 obviously the hard thing to talk about with obama is commander in chief of all his many talents
7438159 you dont rah rah about commander in chief you rah rah about hope and change and a new party and all that so no matter what he does somebody will find fault with it
7438160 some senior obama supporters are irritated at how they perceive the clintons fanned or at a minimum failed to douse stories that she was not even vetted as a possible vice presidential nominee
7438161 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7438162 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7438163 i could blame the city for creating an impossible situation where bikers have no safe way to travel at a reasonable speed without breaking the law but i wont
7438164 so the compromise is to create routes where the cars are slowed by frequent stops but bikes are not if this isnt the situation that they intended its still the one that they created
7438165 bicyclists on the other hand expend a lot of effort getting up to speed cranking up the momentum every single block and then giving it all up at every single stop sign gets old really fast so whenever there is any question whether to stop or not such as when there is little oppositional traffic at stop signs or anywhere else for that matter s he understandably doesnt stop doesnt give up his or her hard won momentum that is to say after a while if one bikes all the time a pattern or habit gets established thats what you and the complainers are witnessing
7438166 back in the late 80s a group of us gay punk rockers went to fishermans wharf with a sign have your picture taken with a real punk rock homosexual
7438167 we had people from the midwest coming up to us saying i want that one and that one kissing my husband giggle nothing like pandering to the tourists to make some money
7438168 and i see drag racing in gayland two male tourists race to see who can dress in drag and fool another tourist into believing theyre a female first one with a date wins
7438169 i progressi compiuti verso il comune obiettivo di concludere un accordo di pace nel 2008
7438170 spanair ancora panico in volo problemi tecnici per un aereo
7438171 every time i do art i feel like im not serving utility in a direct way
7438172 every time i do science i miss the spark of the creative impulse but ive come to realize its the same in science or art its about introducing people to new truths
7438173 weve evolved techniques for taste and sight and sound but we have just enough to hunt prey and avoid predators
7438174 but when you tell someone that the rainbow actually goes farther than what you can see they have a tough time dealing with that this show is about using science and technology to experience deeper things to find the deeper sources of awe
7438175 hes strong both technically and artistically but theres something else special about him hes got a flair hes not the stereotypical science and technology guy hes able to talk about science as something thats very hip and hes a great person to communicate that to a whole new generation
7438176 i thought it would be pure mr science and my head would spin with boredom
7438177 whats good about him is that he doesnt talk down to you he tells you the real science in a real way and expects that youre smart enough to understand it
7438178 i think the more that i explore my work the idea that we have perceptual limits the more that it becomes obvious that the world was not created for us
7438179 we are part of this vast evolutionary chain of immense complexity
7438180 there are a lot of ways to be famous and this is such a good one if i become famous it would be because people really enjoy new ways of looking at the world
7438181 vihmane ja jahe suvi on llejoomist eestis m jutanud majanduskasvu pidurdumisest hoopis enam
7438182 we are pleased to see an increase in the number of major construction projects in b c as this is a positive sign that there will be construction activity beyond the olympics
7438183 while the economy is still sound there is no doubt that the construction market has cooled somewhat from the frantic pace of the last few years and we are now in a buyers market
7438184 b c s construction industry now has the capacity to take on new public sector infrastructure projects
7438185 we are continuing to see impressive numbers in large scale construction projects across b c
7438186 this is a clear signal that british columbias economy remains strong and vibrant
7438187 the devil is here boy the devil himself the demon couldnt do what the devil sent him to do so the devil came himself
7438188 we are delighted to work with cn to provide this new canadian gateway to western canadas oilsands
7438189 the port of thunder bay has a long history serving the needs of western canada and we are dedicated to the integration of the marine and rail needs of transportation
7438190 this is a significant investment to upgrade the important rail corridor serving albertas booming oilsands region
7438191 our commitment to infrastructure improvements will enhance safety and capacity and reduce shipping time
7438192 when we bought it we were going to make twenty to thirty thousand dollars
7438193 home sales in the area are down more than in many other parts of the country because sellers are hanging tough
7438194 but ultimately i think theyre going to have to give up and start cutting price
7438195 right now the short sales and foreclosures are a large part of our inventory
7438196 when you go to a bank and say im listing a property for a borrower in trouble they basically say well send us the offers we cant say what well accept
7438197 ive never experienced getting a counteroffer from a bank either they either say yes or no if its no you have to play guesswork and figure out what they will take
7438198 a wanton forgetting of an essential part of a full life
7438199 by the time the county historical society showed up to retrieve the leather bound archives the times had kept for years in a climate controlled room
7438200 rodents had damaged the issues so badly that the volumes had to be destroyed
7438201 can you live with and sleep in the same bed with your former spouse whom you cant stand the sight of for 90 days for a million dollars
7438202 amazing what you come up with when youre laid up and on vicodin
7438203 wow i didnt realize that i had been a lesbian that long
7438204 there will be celebration for a moment but they will realize clearly that there is one more step
7438205 to use a football analogy they have to take this over the goal line
7438206 i think they are congenitally nervous because we lost a bunch of presidential elections where people felt that we should have won but keep in mind that whatever concerns people have about me my campaign in particular we heard those all through the primaries
7438207 i am the son of a black man from kenya and a white woman from kansas
7438208 i have brothers sisters nieces nephews uncles and cousins of every race and every hue scattered across three continents
7438209 a black american who carries within her the blood of slaves and slave owners an inheritance we pass on to our two precious daughters
7438210 he needs to get people to know more about what he stands for weve seen no gains over the last six months in what people know about his policy positions on the economy and foreign policy and he needs to remind people that hes the democrat and that john mccain is the republican candidate who is in the same party as president bush
7438211 the convention is a great opportunity for him to come in and tell the american people that hell turn the economy around and do it in a way that makes people understand that this guy gets it
7438212 its also an opportunity to make a comparative contrast against the republicans particularly after eight years of mishandling everything they had anything to do with
7438213 were going to tell obamas life story but were also going to tell the story about whats happened to the country under the policies that weve seen under the broken politics of washington and were going to talk about how were going to change that
7438214 a comprehensive integrated consistent and managed process or framework for achieving validating and documenting that the performance of a completed building and its major systems meet the design intent and operational requirements of the owner
7438215 well start to get to the real meat and potatoes
7438216 she knows they need freedom she lets them out on occasional trips to see friends
7438217 but their security is paramount she makes sure each trip is meticulously planned
7438218 it still isnt confirmed whether the old schools are the right place
7438219 we do not know where bishop jia is detained at this time we also do not know why he was arrested again this time
7438220 the persecution of religious believers is very much alive in china and ongoing regardless of the fact that the olympics games has just been held in china and closed sunday
7438221 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on earth is adapted co 2 will need to be reduced from its current 385 ppm to at most 350 ppm
7438222 an initial 350 ppm co 2 target may be achievable by phasing out coal use except where co 2 is captured and adopting agricultural and forestry practices that sequester carbon
7438223 if the present overshoot of this target co 2 is not brief there is a possibility of seeding irreversible catastrophic effects
7438224 the time is now and the scale should be global

7438228 they gotta put your face on a 5 000 bill
7438229 we are doing everything in our power to rectify the situation
7438230 many parks are seeking to extend their operating season into what youd call their shoulder seasons spring and fall
7438231 it makes sense they have to pay taxes on their property year round even if they use it only a few months of the year
7438232 we just werent getting enough people to cover the costs
7438233 were looking at having a mime some circus type of entertainment live music it should be totally different than what people are accustomed to
7438234 it will be a nice transition to halloween something different than an octoberfest there are so many others who do octoberfests and a lot of them do a good job so we wanted to try something else
7438235 we think the first year might be slow but if we can make it a success we want to keep it going
7438236 its thrills by day and chills by night we have a trick or treat trail and some cute shows in the day then as the sun goes down the chill factor goes up
7438237 some people will come in and not even a hit a ride at all
7438238 five easy questions that will ignite ideas for your business
7438239 where do you get your ideas for all of your products
7438240 its easy im lazy so if something in my business is taking up too much time then i ask myself how could i automate it ninety percent of my ideas for products come from recognizing what is draining my time i really just want to automate everything
7438241 so far the public has only seen the sound bites and the youtube version and you have not heard from michelle
7438242 it will be a proud moment to see the unedited version the smart graceful harvard educated lawyer mother and supportive spouse
7438243 the muttering you hear is that she has a little too much edge
7438244 shes too smart and too accomplished to stand out there and smile for 15 minutes the challenge is to get up there smooth and charming and not have too much attitude
7438245 it is intended to be very personal open and very revealing about who they are
7438246 america will know their values their life decisions and what drew them to one another
7438247 spouses arent viewed as being as threatening or as partisan as their husbands
7438248 because they are not running for office themselves they can do things voters of both sides of the aisle can appreciate involving illiteracy health care the environment or children they often have the background to make those kinds of things credible
7438249 to only a few chemicals does man owe as great a debt
7438250 of the dozen insecticides who has approved for house spraying the most effective is ddt
7438251 the fact is that ddt is more effective and less expensive than many other insecticides in many situations
7438252 whenever i do the scene i get emotional about my mother whom i lost last year
7438253 students have full access but not turn away community users
7438254 todays students are tomorrows alumni and we want to make sure they have mechanism to all the librarys resources
7438255 we have to do this if we want to remain competitive
7438256 were trying to make this room the best classroom facility on campus
7438257 the students know it the teachers know it the custodians know it the administration knows it and so were going to address that
7438258 in the long run the construction is better for everyone as it makes for a better atmosphere here on campus
7438259 many parks are seeking to extend their operating season into what youd call their shoulder seasons spring and fall
7438260 it makes sense they have to pay taxes on their property year round even if they use it only a few months of the year
7438261 we just werent getting enough people to cover the costs
7438262 were looking at having a mime some circus type of entertainment live music it should be totally different than what people are accustomed to
7438263 it will be a nice transition to halloween something different than an octoberfest there are so many others who do octoberfests and a lot of them do a good job so we wanted to try something else
7438264 we think the first year might be slow but if we can make it a success we want to keep it going
7438265 its thrills by day and chills by night we have a trick or treat trail and some cute shows in the day then as the sun goes down the chill factor goes up
7438266 some people will come in and not even a hit a ride at all
7438267 its just a lot of excitement that we dont normally have certainly not on one weekend in fort collins
7438268 im a farmer originally one day i wrote a music piece pshtt changed my life
7438269 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up
7438270 one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states
7438271 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7438272 when you get yourself in to trouble is when you feel you have to do something and then you get yourself in trouble
7438273 you never know what is possible until you make an attempt and see how far you can go
7438274 this is to teddy this is what he has accomplished
7438275 he has done so much in his life and overcome a great deal he really is one of the best senators this country has ever had the best
7438276 the tribute to ted kennedy is not only going to be emotional but it is also going to be political in its motivations
7438277 the idea is of course to stir memories of prior democratic champions and to link obama with them
7438278 i think obama is an amazing candidate and i think he will be an excellent president and i am very excited about working with him for him
7438279 told through a combination of original interviews archival footage and still photographs that chronicle his enormous contributions to this country
7438280 so i think for all our family this is incredibly emotional
7438281 even republicans are going to have to say give him his due hes been there for a long time
7438282 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7438283 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7438284 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7438285 just because you get named something doesnt mean you quit doing what youre doing if you do that youll just give it back up i was expecting to get the starting job the whole time but it means a lot to have my teammates behind me i think thats what makes a team everybody has to be behind everybody
7438286 i havent played on a team this well ever in my life
7438287 its nice to say i play with an all american barnes and another all conference hitter strauss and to know that were developed enough to be going in as the 17 ranked team this season
7438288 there are a lot of new people coming in and pushing old players
7438289 all around we have a good group of girls and it keeps you in check and it is good for everybody
7438290 if i had to set my own goals i would not set a goal to be an all american
7438291 it was a surprise a blessing and im glad i got it but this is a whole new season
7438292 every summer i have stayed here and worked out i have gotten better physically and i hope my skills as a player continue to improve
7438293 we try not to get so far ahead of ourselves but we do have meetings and we do set goals
7438294 we talk about what a great opportunity we have and we can do great things if we take care of business
7438295 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7438296 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7438297 its a unique event in the fact that theres so many facets to it
7438298 there isnt that divide where theres a couple of huge movies coming every week
7438299 i said to my partner one thing were lucky about is that weve done so many stadium shows
7438300 well rehearse a little and then show up thursday and hope to do it
7438301 i have my team with me i know what were getting into its not easy but at the end of the day its going to be one of the most historic things ever and how can you not want to be a part of it
7438302 every time you do one of these you try to do something technologically advanced that people havent seen before
7438303 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against the public life so we decided to declare it banned
7438304 anyone having link with this organization promoting its literature and message helping it financially or in any other way will be taken to task according to the law
7438305 has no bearing on ones ability to activate xp installations
7438306 this is a significant issue and they have to work to address it
7438307 these are some of the growing pains of a distribution becoming more complex they are building more and more into their operating systems and with that comes more complexity and more challenges but what i think is most important here is the response
7438308 at this time we are confident there is little risk to fedora users who wish to install or upgrade signed fedora packages
7438309 may obtain red hat binary packages via channels other than those of official red hat subscribers
7438310 break down barriers that prevent people and ideas from connecting
7438311 the industry has taken much greater strides than anyone ever imagined 40 years ago
7438312 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
7438313 what if those machines had a small amount of intelligence and they could assemble themselves into various shapes and were capable of movement or locomotion
7438314 if you had enough of them you could create arbitrary shapes and have the assembly of machines that could take on any form and move in arbitrary ways
7438315 my cell phone is too big to fit comfortably in my pocket and too small for my fingers its worse if i try to watch movies or do my e mail but if i had 200 to 300 milliliters of catoms i could have it take on the shape of the device that i need at that moment
7438316 to form its smallest shape or even be a little squishy so i can just drop it in my pocket
7438317 sometime over the next 40 years this will become everyday technology
7438318 if we could really cut the cord and not be burdened with all these heavy batteries and not worry if you have the charger if we could transmit power wirelessly think of all the machines that would become much more efficient
7438319 it was about two or three months ago all the taxis in our company had this fitted
7438320 for the first time foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
7438321 compared to similar efforts in other states chinas filtering regime is pervasive sophisticated and effective it comprises multiple levels of legal regulation and technical control it involves numerous state agencies and thousands of public and private personnel it censors content transmitted through multiple methods including web pages web logs on line discussion forums university bulletin board systems and e mail messages
7438322 propaganda harmful to national security and social stability of the peoples republic
7438323 after the olympic games are over the chinese authorities will probably come down very heavily on the tibetans they will also bring more armed forces inside tibet and increase the transfer of han population the post olympics is therefore more dangerous than the present moment
7438324 need to maintain pressure on china for human rights reform after the beijing olympics
7438325 abuses including the torture and ill treatment of prisoners use of the death penalty censorship restrictions on assembly and repression of minorities are still commonplace in china
7438326 we must learn lessons from this issue march april demonstrations and organise our masses to build up an impregnable fortress against the tide of encirclement to beat our enemy so you the leaders of work units must guard your gates and manage your people well let leaders of street committees be vigilant and keep watch on all outsiders
7438327 propaganda and education are our partys greatest advantages these are the most useful weapons with which to defend ourselves against the dalai lama group
7438328 china will find that controlling the internet is easier than taming price pressures officials in beijing have compliant executives at google and yahoo helping them censor cyberspace even after employing all of the conventional tools of economic policy cooling inflation is easier said than done
7438329 but on a per capita basis the country isnt a dragon its a medium size lizard sitting in 109th place on the international monetary funds world economic outlook database squarely between swaziland and morocco chinas economy is large but its average living standard is low
7438330 its like a huge cage where all kinds of birds coexist if you try to drive away those noisy ones you would lose that wonderful variety and colour the key is to mind our own business well
7438331 it was about two or three months ago all the taxis in our company had this fitted
7438332 for the first time foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
7438333 compared to similar efforts in other states chinas filtering regime is pervasive sophisticated and effective it comprises multiple levels of legal regulation and technical control it involves numerous state agencies and thousands of public and private personnel it censors content transmitted through multiple methods including web pages web logs on line discussion forums university bulletin board systems and e mail messages
7438334 propaganda harmful to national security and social stability of the peoples republic
7438335 after the olympic games are over the chinese authorities will probably come down very heavily on the tibetans they will also bring more armed forces inside tibet and increase the transfer of han population the post olympics is therefore more dangerous than the present moment
7438336 need to maintain pressure on china for human rights reform after the beijing olympics
7438337 abuses including the torture and ill treatment of prisoners use of the death penalty censorship restrictions on assembly and repression of minorities are still commonplace in china

7438343 tell them to vomit into it what they have eaten
7438344 these two women have been fasting from what god made lawful to them and have broken their fast on what god exalted is he made unlawful to them
7438345 i was surprised to learn how many people had been watching us waiting for us to finish
7438346 it was neat to hear so many were anxious to see us get open
7438347 we wanted to be more than a shopping need but a place where families could drop by in the afternoon and kids could pick out a little treat
7438348 some have already started looking out for us wanting to make sure we succeed
7438349 what was more important to me though was that customers seem to be taking a bit of ownership in this place which is great
7438350 itll be a long process but in order to get people to change their habits of just driving by this intersection well have to make sure we stay consistent with the standards we and the neighborhood want
7438351 there are a lot of specialty items that people have to drive to lynnwood or seattle to get and we wanted to offer it in bellingham
7438352 when there is a shooting in birmingham tensions between gangs do arise and as part of keeping an open mind if this does end up being part of a gang dispute then we would appeal for calm
7438353 i have no idea why somebody would want to do something like this
7438354 they have nothing to do with a progressive point of view
7438355 i dont think you would find anybody in the progressive movement who would say yes they are spokesmen for what we believe in
7438356 without liberals and progressives to yell at without liberal positions to make fun of fox doesnt exist
7438357 you can walk into a room where everybody agrees with you give a talk and everyone applauds you so you leave the room thinking youve accomplished something or you can go into a room filled with people who either havent made their minds up or disagree with you and try to open some minds
7438358 being on fox is like going into the second room
7438359 if you asked a vermonter how many houses they have they would have no problem answering that question
7438360 estamos dispuestos a que el pse apoye a basagoiti como candidato a lehendakari
7438361 i cant tell what i will do i will hug him kiss him i cant wait for the moment when i have him next to me talking to me eating with me
7438362 you see them sitting watching the news with wide eyes there is a feeling that not only did he succeed in killing now he is going to continue with his life to build his family
7438363 it was very difficult and so were the days afterwards it re opened the wounds i was mourning again just like it was in the beginning
7438364 my pain is terrible and big but there are other families who suffer and i cant close my eyes or my heart to their feelings
7438365 it was tough they the haran family are from my home town i know everything
7438366 the worst thing was to work for two years and to end every day alone and then to get him back but not alive
7438367 its talked about like its a deal but its not a deal its a person
7438368 what my father has done is a normal reaction of any person in any occupied country
7438369 after spending 20 years in israeli jails he deserves to be released
7438370 why do we have to be punished when they are not
7438371 the payback on a per acre basis is generally quite good when compared to a lot of other crops and its as simple as getting a cup of coffee and watching the blades spin
7438372 its a great result for all the players to find out whether were going or not going
7438373 its a good decision for cricket and we are pleased it was unanimous
7438374 we look forward to dealing with our international colleagues over the details of when the tournament will be postponed to
7438375 by postponing the tournament until october next year there is time for the security situation in pakistan to improve or for a suitable alternative venue to be chosen
7438376 we appreciate the difficulties that this decision will cause the pakistan cricket board and hope that the champions trophy can be held there in 2009
7438377 hopefully ill be playing for a few years to come so hopefully ill get the opportunity to play in pakistan
7438378 come next year whenever they put it back on were looking forward to regaining that trophy but right now all the guys are rapt that the icc has made a decision
7438379 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
7438380 wtf is wrong with this chick another mixtape series yup i change mixtape series like i change baby fathers but nothings
7438381 einerseits kann ich die leute verstehen wenn sie nach f nf sechs fehlp ssen unruhig werden
7438382 aber in dieser phase h tte ich mir gew nscht dass diese leute mehr geduld aufbringen
7438383 wir m ssen hinterfragen ob wir konsequent im abschluss waren
7438384 nat rlich denken wir immer dar ber nach ob alles richtig war was wir getan haben
7438385 doch ich halte es mit meinem vater man sollte nicht vor dem pr geln heulen die saison ist noch nicht zu ende
7438386 nat rlich k nnen alle spieler besser spielen und das werden sie auch tun
7438387 kami berharap agar ia dapat dikuatkuasakan sebagai salah satu akta atau undang undang dalam bidang penyiaran di negara kita
7438388 la mentalidad de ir a por los partidos pase lo que pase
7438389 un equipo tiene que tener mentalidad y el a o pasado el real madrid ya demostr esa casta para ir por los partidos pasara lo que pasara hoy con estas expulsiones la reacci n volvi a ser positiva porque siguieron pensando en que se pod a ir por el partido
7438390 bonito emocionante y justo por la entrega que demostraron todos los jugadores sobre el campo
7438391 tanto como jugador como entrenador pero en el f tbol hay muchas sorpresas y yo s lo confiaba en que el valencia fuera de esos equipos que parecen tener problemas con un jugador m s porque para esto tambi n hay que tener cualidades y hoy el rival no las ha tenido
7438392 es una derrota dura dolorosa pero es un entrenador joven que acaba de empezar en este equipo que tambi n mostr otra cara por lo que hay que contar con ellos en esta temporada
7438393 no es una situaci n c moda ni para l ni para nosotros que no jugara fue una decisi n m a pero s lo quise convocar para tenerlo y que est cerca del equipo porque vamos a ver qu pasa al final hay que pensar en que tambi n se puede quedar en el equipo esta temporada
7438394 todo a su favor tanto por resultado como por el n mero de jugadores
7438395 nos hemos llevado una derrota cuando en principio estaba todo favorable tanto por el resultado como por el n mero de jugadores pero el real madrid ha sabido apelar a la fuerza de su estadio se ha exigido m s con menos jugadores y nosotros no hemos sabido organizarnos para atacar con orden por lo que s lo nos queda felicitar al rival y aprender de cara al futuro
7438396 un palo para los jugadores y para todo el valencia
7438397 en el descanso quer amos mantener la misma l nea tener el bal n y buscar subidas por banda para mantener el resultado pero sali todo lo contrario hay que dar su m rito al rival que ha sabido tener esa fe igual que nosotros la tuvimos en la ida lo que tenemos que hacer es reaccionar para que no vuelva a suceder en el futuro
7438398 hay que quedarse con las sensaciones del equipo en la primera mitad
7438399 nos encontramos con una situaci n favorable en el campo pero esa fuerza para controlar no la tuvimos y en el segundo tiempo tuvimos una p jara importante y no supimos jugarle al real madrid
7438400 ahora hay que levantarnos con rapidez de esto hay que ser optimista crecer y nosotros lo vamos a hacer
7438401 its new but its cool that they are trying it out on such an important political year
7438402 i dont think its very professional to send information that way regarding our presidential election
7438403 it also hurts for lower class people who dont all have cell phones
7438404 it definitely raises awareness about politicians and whos running though
7438405 this is a good way to directly connect with students who arent directly involved in the campaign
7438406 we are demanding change whether its barack obama or john mccain
7438407 he obama was reaching out and this was the most effective way to reach people
7438408 the process by which the principles of the fast food restaurant are coming to dominate
7438409 but take a lesson always look out for yourself kid
7438410 they can see its not a huge problem some have even gone out on activities on tours or sand biking
7438411 you are bound to go to prison and you know that
7438412 what is particularly heartbreaking is that the scarecrow was wearing the scooby costume which thomas loves we have been up and down the dale but we cannot find any sign of him
7438413 it is a very tight community we have here and i would find it unlikely that scooby has been taken by a local
7438414 a neighbour spotted a man loading him into the boot of his car and told him to put homer down
7438415 the scarecrow competition has proved to be an important fundraiser and curtain raiser for the weardale agricultural society show which is held at st johns chapel at the end of this month
7438416 villagers in the upper dale have put in a lot of hard work preparing these scarecrows
7438417 their aim was to bring enjoyment to both people living here and the many visitors we have here during the holidays
7438418 we are appalled at what has happened next year we may have to look at more secure ways of siting the scarecrows
7438419 it has been a wonderful competition with some terrific entries it is sad that it should be marred by something like this
7438420 gateshead international stadium is already a world famous athletics venue and its reputation as a major training facility is growing
7438421 our aim now is to capitalise on what we already have here by developing something really special
7438422 our selection by the london organising committee of the olympic games as a pre games training camp for 2012 has given us the impetus to develop our existing sports facilities even further
7438423 were now looking for a developer to take on an even bigger challenge by creating the regions top ice arena and laying the foundations to a sports village worthy of olympic champions
7438424 its full steam ahead to 2012 now its an honour to be a training venue and were all excited about being part of the games
7438425 the whole district is really proud of joannes fantastic achievement in beijing so it is right that we ask her family to help celebrate her success
7438426 the white water course will be a training ground for the london games so its the perfect place for stockton to celebrate the olympic handover
7438427 it seemed every gun in norway was directed at us we were a sitting target and were shot down even before we reached the tirpitz
7438428 the aircraft was a fireball it banked and then headed for a frozen lake we skidded across it into some trees
7438429 a farming family rescued us and i remember two little girls helped remove our flying helmets which they later hid in a wood
7438430 to me they were true war heroes how they kept that nights events a secret is incredible the temptation to tell their friends must have been overwhelming but they told nobody and that gave us the chance to escape
7438431 i knocked on a door and the lady who answered knew the story
7438432 we went into his barn and there on the wall was my helmet
7438433 the girls had recovered it from the wood and the family had kept it in the hope that one day i would return to collect it
7438434 once again nice has shown how poorly it assesses new cancer treatments
7438435 mean survivals obscure the fact that some patients will obtain prolonged benefit from these drugs
7438436 we have already seen distraught patients remortgaging their houses giving up pensions and selling cars simply to buy drugs that are freely available to those using health services in countries of comparable wealth
7438437 it just cant be that everybody else around the world is wrong about access to innovative cancer care and the nhs right in rationing it so severely
7438438 we had some quite difficult personal circumstances over the past two years and it gave us a sense of what is important
7438439 as a christian i felt quite moved that if i could do something to help people i should
7438440 when they think of poverty people tend to think of places in africa central america has been called the forgotten continent the people are desperately desperately poor you are talking about people who are living on less than 50p a day
7438441 we were very humbled by some of the people we met who had nothing yet were so pleased we were there we went to see a family who were living in just a tin shed but had decorated the roof with crepe paper for us
7438442 there were some scary moments as well there are about 40 murders a day in guatemala and a lot of gangrelated crime we were very aware of that when we were there
7438443 i think sometimes you have got to take a risk we cant stay here and plod on with our lives and always regret not trying to help
7438444 we think the logistics of getting such a deal done are very challenging particularly with amds equity value and cash position falling everyday after all why would a firm want to do a deal with amd today when it can just wait a little longer and do the deal even cheaper
7438445 i firmly believe that our salvation depends on the poor
7438446 if we do not keep indoctrinating we lose the vision and if we lose the vision we become merely philanthropists doling out palliatives
7438447 ive never missed an election and ive voted democratic ever since
7438448 part of what eds tried to do is see that stonewall is positioned to have influence
7438449 he approaches things like a recipe first you boil the water and then you do this
7438450 it made the community and media look at this from a broad perspective not just a gay and lesbian perspective
7438451 i wanted to make sure we had a voice in the state campaign
7438452 i would have smacked me at the time if i was my child
7438453 with all the adversity ed always maintains optimism and a balance of joy against any kind of bigotry
7438454 we want to keep drivers driving as long as they can do so safely
7438455 dont break me up i wouldnt offend any person be they black asian or whatever
7438456 jan and i would love to do a show up there in sacramento
7438457 well do it with open arms because gov arnold schwarzenegger is one of our friends he might come with maria lets put on a show
7438458 offensive derogatory and hateful racial stereotypes detrimental and destructive to our society
7438459 it breaks my heart blake edwards who directed the picture wanted me to do it because he was a comedy director they hired me to do this overboard and we had fun doing it
7438460 never in all the more than 40 years after we made it not one complaint
7438461 i was born in brooklyn delivered by a chinese doctor on a table in a boardinghouse on sept 23 1920
7438462 i came from a poor family my father was from glasgow scotland my mothers brothers were brakemen on the railroad we didnt have anything but mush for breakfast
7438463 its terribly sad and i feel bad for the people taking offense
7438464 i could see him almost in tears the other day we both were
7438465 those that didnt like it i forgive them and god bless america
7438466 god bless the universe god bless japanese chinese indians all of them and lets have peace
7438467 weve been keeping an eye on it and we could see from one week to the next the evaporation was pretty serious
7438468 as the water diminishes theyre going to get less oxygen and just create more problems
7438469 we really want to do a good job and get as many fish out of there as we can
7438470 people will be able to do more and still be observant
7438471 whats great about sacramento is that it is an inclusive community
7438472 now mothers and the elderly dont have to stay home and be isolated
7438473 people have wanted this for 20 years and rabbi posy did it
7438474 they explained to me what they needed and i thought it was a good thing
7438475 this has been a dream for a lot of people for many years
7438476 this is wonderful for the community because well be seeing a lot more children at services
7438477 if i can take advantage of my relationships and the celebrity that i have and the networking ive done to benefit sacramento im going to do that
7438478 sacramento is no longer a cow town and i dont want anybody to imagine us or see us that way
7438479 shes going against a well financed candidate with pretty substantial name id and lots of celebrity and high profile buddies
7438480 when its all said and done this race is in sacramento
7438481 we havent run into anyone who said if michael bloomberg is for him ill support him i dont think thats how people think
7438482 it may seem unconventional but when youre running against a 20 year politician with a rolodex full of names it can be hard for an outsider
7438483 kevin has his own hefty rolodex and he might as well use it
7438484 not very often but kevin is a personal friend whose work in education ive admired
7438485 helps funders take you seriously and helps with serious democratic voters
7438486 sacramento has become a big city in its own right
7438487 so the fact these people are paying attention to whats happening in sacramento adds some cachet
7438488 to break through that aint easy especially at the local level
7438489 in a quieter year you may be able to get peoples attention a lot easier and cheaper
7438490 min far sagde at jeg skulle l be op p hj rnet og se om hunden med de to r vhuller stadig stod her
7438491 the government will be left with no option but to return the 400 acres to the unwilling farmers we will continue to agitate till our demand is met
7438492 giving away 400 acres means giving up the entire project which is not possible we want another round of discussion with the opposition party during which some solution can come up
7438493 forceful acquisition of land is unconstitutional we will fight against this and win
7438494 we will do peaceful agitation till our demand is met
7438495 we want our land back and we will continue to agitate till our demand is met
7438496 the government will be left with no option but to return the 400 acres to the unwilling farmers we will continue to agitate till our demand is met
7438497 giving away 400 acres means giving up the entire project which is not possible we want another round of discussion with the opposition party during which some solution can come up
7438498 forceful acquisition of land is unconstitutional we will fight against this and win
7438499 we will do peaceful agitation till our demand is met
7438500 we want our land back and we will continue to agitate till our demand is met
7438501 he determined that the internment camp wasnt going to ruin his life
7438502 he wasnt going to allow something like that to drag him down
7438503 he would not talk about the internment camps unless you asked him then he would answer direct questions
7438504 in my situation this economic prize is very important for afghan athletes
7438505 this culture of incentives is very important all around the world but doesnt really exist in afghanistan we need to have more of this
7438506 for most of the athletes the push for a gold medal is not driven by opportunity for financial gain
7438507 its driven by their competitive nature and the pursuit of their full potential as an athlete
7438508 i dont even know how much this thing is worth
7438509 its about the fire within id live in a cardboard box to show the world what i do
7438510 there are mountain ranges raging streams and muddy tracks and the terrain is very rough
7438511 ive rehearsed in daisy hill forest but this is far more challenging and inhospitable
7438512 another major challenge is to simply stay awake but theres a flight waiting for me at the other end and this should be incentive enough to make it
7438513 were happy but its tempered by the memory of ben
7438514 i dont think people are going to be upset by us remaining on level 2 for as long as we possibly can
7438515 it does give greater flexibility particularly for our elderly people
7438516 ben could have been at home with his family but his passion love of his work empathy to our four legged friends and support to our family will always make ben stand out as a truly wonderful guy
7438517 ben your smile sense of humour and caring attititude will never be replaced you were the best you will be missed by all you came into contact with
7438518 if my handicapped son had a question he dr cunneen always had time to answer it and because of him my son has furthered his passion and has hand raised two foals since five months old which are now 22 months old
7438519 although ben only came out to our horse once he was one of those special people whose compassion friendliness and skill will always be remembered
7438520 ben was a beautiful lad and we as a family feel blessed to have known him our deepest sympathy thoughts and prayers go to gill his wife and bens family this world has certainly been improved with the likes of bens presence
7438521 i think shes done well shes just a 16 year old girl
7438522 the olympics was an awesome experience and i have had so much fun
7438523 i have really tried to soak up the experience and i learnt a lot from these games
7438524 i was just elated very upset for the dog but so happy callum was alive
7438525 he realises that ralphies not coming back but i dont think he really grasps the magnitude of what could have happened
7438526 if the girls hadnt have heard those calls we wouldnt have found him somebodys watching over him
7438527 my mums girlfriend suggested it modelling i went to marcia foley at viva victoria point who taught me to walk i went in the girlfriend model search at carindale in august and didnt get in but i was spotted by a photographer and it went from there
7438528 i love it now its become my whole life i love all aspects but most of all its just fun
7438529 there is something down to earth and sweet about her which makes her easy to work with brittaneys not really a swimwear model she prefers high end fashion

7438539 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue
7438540 this could give you an almost infinite number of switches and options for communication

7438546 in the beginning it was about single clip videos but now the mainstream content has come online and there is an expectation for quality
7438547 one of the challenges we all have now is that the web audience has adult attention deficit disorder and moves around quickly a company that draws audience by creating a destination will win the video war
7438548 its all about creating tv like experience the advertisers need to be able to predict frequency which allows brands to build the presence with viewers
7438549 creating a virtual cycle between watching tv and online so they are complementary is the future of the industry
7438550 its very empowering for our fans to know that there are tens of thousands of people watching the show at the same time
7438551 right now we are talking about pc and tv but soon every device will have a potential for video your photo frame will stream videos from grandmas visit or broadcast the weather channel
7438552 pretty soon the idea of tv sitting in the living room will disappear

7438593 he has the flexibility i like in players and the ability to play in a number of positions his performance was key to our victory
7438594 this was a big win for us irrespective of the fact west ham went down to 10 men so early i felt we were in control
7438595 there was a real determination in our play and a willingness to ask questions of the opposition
7438596 it was a good all round performance and once we got our noses in front there was always going to be one winner
7438597 i do not think any one of my players can hold their hands up and say they performed
7438598 given the personnel we have available i do not think we were equipped to play with 10 men
7438599 we needed to defend in the second half with our lives and the first goal is always important

7438604 the jury is still out how big shale is going to be
7438605 shale is the most significant domestic natural gas find in 50 years
7438606 which means the united states will become gas independent and more industrially competitive versus europe for gas intensive industries such as chemicals fertilizer smelting iron and aluminum

7438610 we could turn this country into chechnya we had enough people and equipment to do that or we had to do nothing and stay a modern european country
7438611 eventually we would have chased them away but we would have had to go to the mountains and grow beards that would have been a tremendous national philosophical and emotional burden

7438625 its an area known for avalanches it the ice regularly breaks off here
7438626 they were in the trail but problem was that the avalanche swept away the trail
7438627 the guide shouted run fast run fast it didnt make any noise it really was impressive
7438628 we had just enough time to move away to the right before getting hit we were really lucky
7438629 from the moment we could locate them with radar echo and surface analyses it was already five hours after the avalanche so theres no more hope
7438630 thats where we got the first indications that iran had acquired centrifuges

7438639 the prime minister did make it clear to china that she should be released
7438640 post olympics china is slowing not because the olympics are over but because of global forces
7438641 chinas macro statistics are going to look terrible the rest of this year and into 2009 china wants to act and supporting the growth rate is going to be overwhelmingly the top policy priority
7438642 our view is that the administration has a number of levers they can pull in the attempt to keep growth around 10 per cent in the second half and into next year

7438700 as the recent referendum on the lisbon treaty in ireland suggests at least some of those who were previously enthusiastic about the founding aims of the eu both social and economic are now expressing unease
7438701 a fairly widespread culture in european affairs which relegates manifestations of ones own religious convictions to the private and subjective sphere
7438702 successive decisions which have undermined the family based on marriage the right to life from the moment of conception to natural death the sacredness of the sabbath the right of christian institutions to maintain and promote their ethos including schools these and other decisions have made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive commitment to the european project
7438703 without respect for its christian memory and soul i believe it is possible to anticipate continuing difficulties for the european project

7438726 up to now the slightest criticism of radical islam on campus has been slammed as islamophobia while muslim groups and their radical fellow travelers have been allowed to say the most hateful things imaginable about christians and jews without any reaction from university administrators whatsoever
7438727 provost nikias has called the hadith on the msa website for what it is despicable given the atmosphere that prevails on most campuses today it was an act of integrity on his part to make this call and to demand that the msa live up to basic standards of civility that should govern the university

7438735 right at the time oil prices are skyrocketing were struggling with the economy were concerned about global warming and national security threats remain intense we wake up and weve got this abundance of natural gas around us
7438736 because id never written songs before we didnt know what the rules were
7438737 we didnt know you shouldnt write about the tasteless things going around in your head
7438738 this musical is coming from the mind of dana marschz the teacher and he doesnt think its funny and hes not trying to be offensive
7438739 the joke of it is that hes so damaged and hes trying to be so honest with his feelings but hes so limited with his abilities that it ends up being completely inappropriate
7438740 hes the son of god and i think thats cool
7438741 so why do i feel like ive been raped in the face
7438742 it maybe came out of frustration because we had seen so many musicals and we were trying to do something that was really funny
7438743 im not pretending these songs are as good as any musical ever
7438744 i hope people will think theyre a breath of fresh air
7438745 however mistaken he might be hes really passionate hes not cynical
7438746 hes trying to do something hes trying to make a difference and thats what underpins some of the dumb stuff in it

7438750 its a perfect opportunity both to celebrate the history of television and at the same time introduce new generations to some of the mediums most important events
7438751 how can you comprehend at 12 or 13 that youre going to be discarded
7438752 it was going so well then when it stopped i didnt know what i had done wrong
7438753 i was always so nice to people i never turned my back on people
7438754 but i didnt think there was anything i could do i was scared to say i didnt want to wear something to be that girl who had an attitude or didnt cooperate i liked having my mom there so she could say it
7438755 that started in new york calling her obese at a size 4
7438756 i thought i needed to diet i was doing all this to make my mom proud to make money and all of a sudden it stopped i would just eat salad i didnt want to go to the beach because of my stretch marks
7438757 dont ask questions criticize me say things that are hypocritical and look at me as if you are totally satisfied with the way you look im human youre human
7438758 at school at lunchtime im in the bathroom holding girls hair while they throw up my friends dad took her for a consultation with a plastic surgeon to get rid of her love handles
7438759 i had a model friend who was too small pants were always way too big for her
7438760 there is seventeen and teen vogue those are fun they have teachers on set
7438761 its still fun for me but if i ever do another runway show im going to be walking for the empowerment of women not just walking on a stage
7438762 here i am miss healthy fit swedish flicka playing this drug addict
7438763 but this play is very physical its closer to restoration comedy or french farce so you have to go out and really deliver the goods at every performance
7438764 one that may prove to be a crowning moment in an illustrious career
7438765 i think its had an effect on my psyche because every one of those scenes is one that i dont want to have in my own life
7438766 violet doesnt want to sit down and be interrogated every scene is something she really doesnt want to have except when shes drugged out and then she seems to be comfortable
7438767 ive been acting all my life and ive always felt you should be in shape im used to devoting my whole life to the work and what it requires
7438768 estelle has so much stamina and so much energy and she has stayed working and never retired
7438769 shes quite the opposite of violet but lets hope everyone is the opposite of that character
7438770 sometimes you cant even walk in the aisles its so packed
7438771 in the end it really is just a labor of love
7438772 you want a poster that looks like how a band sounds
7438773 when you get a group with a really oddball sound you can go kind of wild with the design
7438774 i was sketching around and i just drew that crazy face
7438775 the original sketch was one inch high and i thought it would be fun to blow it up i wanted the sound of boris to invade the poster the torn edges i almost wanted to look like they were invading someone elses poster their sound is kind of loud and crushing i dont know if others would put it that way but thats the way i interpreted it
7438776 one of the really interesting things to come out of bumbershoot for me was a couple who wanted me to design a wedding poster invitation for them
7438777 i think personally posters are a sign of a thriving community
7438778 getting to meet a lot of my colleagues is fun
7438779 its really inspiring to see all of that other work out there
7438780 ive been trying to take weekends and not work the job never stops its a hard job to have but its also a really liberating job i can do what i want
7438781 for example a couple of years ago for death cab for cuties transatlanticism i did two different posters
7438782 more people are waking up and saying i want to do that too
7438783 music has always been a big part of my life and when i moved out here i realized there was a big poster community here
7438784 his music to me is not quite gospel but it has that southern preacher vibe so i originally used a church
7438785 for this we went with something a little lighter and not so strongly themed but something that really fit with his music i tried to find images that reminded me of him

7438789 with his wife jenny bond said from their home in sydney
7438790 he said im on my way to atlantic city want to come
7438791 we called him bucket billy because he was doing demonstrations with a bucket for five or six years
7438792 all the pitches he does on tv now are just like the ones he did in atlantic city
7438793 they said heres the baton kid we see something in you
7438794 you start by asking yourself a question how much are these
7438795 im glad you asked you can buy them in stores right now for 29 99 and they come in this beautiful gift box but before 12 oclock today the boss says i have 50 to sell at 15 apiece but for the first 10 people they cost one 10 dollar bill now who is first and then you just point to the nearest guy the guy who seemed most eager and say you are number one and that guy always went along with it it was amazing and then someone would raise their hand and say im number two and pretty soon you had 10 people handing you money
7438796 back then it was go out there and pitch kid
7438797 id go for 18 straight minutes if they had enough product id be selling 40 000 worth of mops in one day in between id sell a scooter then wolfgang puck would show up and id taste some of his creations
7438798 it was eerie but on the other hand when looking at it from stauffenbergs viewpoint and what he did and what these men did it was powerful
7438799 as an actor i think i can say for all of us who were there that we felt fortunate to get those locations and shoot at those places it really changes the performances to do it there at that spot
7438800 these guys are true american patriots they were fighting two wars

7439039 the loan was without the approval of the state governor but since the admission of the loan procurement without due process and deposited in a private account the state government has not reacted on whether he would be withdrawn or not
7439040 the state government is not liable for the repayment of the n150million loan
7439041 we challenge the pdp to show evidence that there was or there is an attempt to topple the federal government it is not enough for them to say we have documentary evidence so they should go further to publicise the so called evidence if they want nigerians to take them seriously
7439042 until they do this our position is that the coup or destabilisation theory is a false and mischievous attempt to make a scape goat of leading opposition figures with a view to demonizing them and cowing them into submission in the pdps undemocratic quest to make nigeria a one party state
7439043 pdp has failed nigerians it did not win elections it usurped power and lied to nigerians about a seven point agenda and a bogus 20 20 20 vision today it is overwhelmed and is shopping for excuses to cover its shameful failures but no one is deceived
7439044 they cannot even achieve 50 50 50 and i challenge them from yaradua to the ordinary pdp member to a televised public debate on their so called seven point agenda let nigerians know who is fooling whom
7439045 pdp mentioned the nud of which i am an active member and i want it on record that nud has no business with coup plotting
7439046 the nud just like the cnpp wants fundamental change and has called for it but it is change through mass action but one thing is clear our agitation for change does not and will not involve collaboration with the military or foreign forces

7439069 the fbi correctly diagnosed that mortgage fraud was epidemic but it did not come close to meeting its announced goal
7439070 it used everyday procedures and woefully inadequate resources to deal with an epidemic
7439071 the approach was certain to bring symbolic prosecutions and strategic defeat
7439072 we were dealing with the issue as best we could back then
7439073 were able to go and continue to find very attractive investment opportunities even in a constrained financing environment
7439074 while deal volume and values clearly have stepped back in the middle market the overall environment is relatively calm and functional compared to the roiled waters of the larger private equity world
7439075 they never relied on financial engineering per se as the sole basis of generating return

7439077 personal opinion as a lawyer the question is whether bakassi has been part of nigerian territory because there was no place called nigeria before 1914
7439078 with regards to the issue affecting and relating to niger dock plc you will remember that there was a motion that was moved about a matter of urgent national importance relating to or mentioning arms arms importation arms trafficking arms distribution by niger dock
7439079 it was raised on the floor of the house considering the security importance and implications of the allegations
7439080 the house was further concerned because it was alleged that it is those arms that are finding their way to the niger delta and it being applied to effect the security in the niger delta and consequently oil outputs and a lot of other things
7439081 what has been done is that by monday the officers have been invited to meet with the speaker to brief the speaker on what they know about this matter affecting concerning or relating to nigerdock in accordance with the resolution of the house so that as we resume the speaker will be able to brief the house on what has been done thus far
7439082 i want to re emphasise that the invitation is as it relates to the national security implications of the alleged action by nigerdock plc
7439083 again we have considered that it would be absolutely necessary to also hear from the national security adviser on this matter thus the national security adviser will also be invited to brief the speaker on this matter because of the seriousness of the allegation
7439084 we want to state clearly and unequivocally that it was all the members of the house present that sat and took that decision for the purchase of vehicles as utility vehicles for members to use in working in committees
7439085 it was not the speaker that took any such decision and the management executed the acquisition of the vehicles in accordance with the resolution of the house and we have found nothing wrong in the way the management handled the purchase or supply of the vehicles
7439086 we want to say for the avoidance of doubt that it is not the decision of one person it was the decision of the 358 members who were present at that time
7439087 apart from my grand father and mum my sister draws she paints so i think everybody took a bit of the art and mine is the fashion designing aspect we are very into arts definitely because i dont know if there is anybody who studied medicine or something like that in the family as a child i used to model for my mum at sheraton hotel i remember that i used to enjoy cat walking on stage so designing just came naturally to me
7439088 id say that came from my maternal side my grand father samuel adedoyin is into business as you know but i think im very like my aunty princess funke adedoyin who was a former minister she is a very driven person every time i look at her i just want to be like her and some of the things that ive been able to do she is always there encouraging me
7439089 i think to an extent yes you dont have to say anything the dress will speak for you and get you recognized our people like being visual you might call it vain or shallow but people will give you audience when you are able to get attention let me add that there is a difference between being chic and noticed and being over the top that is why when you come to me and say you want an elaborate style and you want it in red id tell you it doesnt make any sense because red as a colour is already loud so what i do its either the colour is loud or the style is elaborate
7439090 a womans body definitely when somebody comes to make an outfit it is the persons body that determines the way the dress will look the dress will accentuate the body what i like about the womans body is the waist line i like a defined waist line if you have a big tummy we have to do something to make sure that the tummy goes in or is well covered i also like the legs because i do a lot of short dresses and when you wear nice shoes it gives the woman some kind of classy chic look
7439091 i absolutely adore deola segoe she doesnt know me and she makes clothes for grandpa but i still dont know her another person is mrs nike ogunlesi of ruff n tumble she is actually one of my mentors the reason i like them is because they are very humble people if you meet them today and youve not seen a picture of them before you would not know they are the people you hear about they are very humble people but have made a lot of impact in the industry you enter a place and you see a deola segoes dress you cant miss it but she might be sitting there and you wont know she is the one the same goes for mrs ogunlesi she is very calm there is a kind of aura around her she is the only person i know who makes fantastic childrens clothes
7439092 i like her dressing because she is well put together i also admire one of my customers gbemi aluko if she comes and says make me an outfit id make it without charging her because she carries an outfit well these two people are very classy
7439093 i believe there are cheaper things that you can wear and still look good so i think in the name of fashion i wont kill myself to buy what i cant afford because its fashion
7439094 in fact what the contractor gave out was 90 per cent of his contractual obligations and still retained 10 per cent
7439095 under the back in rights regulations if you are on a sole risk base and you hit oil fg can give you 50 per cent and still retain 50 per cent
7439096 but in this case the agreement was sold by the contractor to the chinese firm without nnpc making a kobo
7439097 it is the fate of this application it will not be granted and it is conveniently refused
7439098 the officers have been invited to brief the speaker and the leadership on matters concerning and relating to niger dock on arms importation the invitation relates to only national security
7439099 a motion on arms distribution was raised on the floor and considering the sensitive nature of the allegations the house directed the speaker to invite the chief of defence staff and all the service chiefs as well as the national security adviser to brief him so that he could report to the house when members resume from vacation
7439100 i want to state clearly and categorically that all members of the house of reps agreed to purchase those vehicles as utility cars and the transaction was executed in accordance with the decision of the house it was the decision of the 358 members of the house because then two of the members had not been sworn in we have found nothing wrong with the way the management handled the purchase and the supply process
7439101 if you go to the various communities you see nddc water projects you see rivers state government water projects you see niger delta basin development water projects all in the same community but none is working
7439102 but if we synchronise them we would have a huge project that would benefit the community and we would make sure they work we have come to review the situation in the nddc and partner with it so that we can move the communities states forward
7439103 we need to ask ourselves how do we overcome poverty how do we overcome unemployment we can partner with nddc in the area of infrastructure which anybody can do but what appears slightly difficult is how to provide employment to our people if we cannot eradicate poverty at least reduce poverty
7439104 this year marks the first stage of the regional master plan which is the roadmap that the commission would use for the sustainable development of the niger delta region

7439114 i never want to say that an injury is career ending but its as bad as it can get as far as issues with the knee according to trainer rod martin
7439115 reece is a project he was a receiver two months ago
7439116 i believe this might be his fourth acl maybe in his career
7439117 hes had a lot of tough breaks injury wise so he was on a one year contract so this was very tough for him
7439118 another option is to wait either until a couple of days for these first cuts or even more for the last cuts the last cuts some good people are getting let go on some of the good teams
7439119 the meetings with government over the scarcity and high cost of kerosene have not yielded any decisive result beside that of a joint committee to look at the issue and make recommendation the government has only been making promises and nothing concrete you are aware of the state of the nations refineries and their production capacity as it is now let me tell you that the major marketers and most of their independent counterpart instead of complementing the good initiative of ap to sell this product for n50 per litre to lessen the suffering nigerians are going through they are sabotaging the effort ap is satisfied with the little profit it is making to ensure that the poor masses can afford kerosene but the major and most of the independent marketers are not interested in lessening the pains of the suffering masses their greed and craze drive to maximize profit at the expense of the poor is now pushing them to sabotage the aps initiative if ap can sell at n50 per litre it means others especially major and other independent marketers could if they have the interest of the poor at heart
7439120 we have been informed that zenon will soon join ap to sell the product at n50 to nigerians in fact from what we have been told the product zenon imported will be berthing any moment from now it is good that zenon is planning complementing what ap is doing already the only problem that is presently associated with aps initiative is that because the management has placed a restriction of selling not more than ten litres per person greedy nigerians have withdrawn their children from schools to be queuing for kerosene for them to resell to fellow nigerians at very exorbitant prices if every family could just buy ten litres and leave things would not be as chaotic as we now see at ap filling stations none the less the ap initiative is what all patriotic nigerians should encourage and support we are calling on the major marketers and other independent marketers to emulate the aps initiative besides that the government should flood the market with this product it is sad even the nigerian national petroleum corporation nnpc cannot help the situation nnpc has not less than 26 depot across the country none of them has been used for products loading for years now
7439121 kerosene is scarce because there is no mass importation by the nnpc no mass production what is produced by the nnpc is not enough to go round that is why supply is not equating with demand the circulation of consumers has increased and the importation is now minimal since the warri and kaduna refinery resumed production and with the rising population in the west african sub region that consumed petroleum product and the importation which has gone down is not massively done like before that is why supply is not equating with demand unless the nnpc is prevailed on to import more but then nnpc is complaining of high subsidy involving about 800 million dollars of food every year but the economy of it is that of the nnpc then the major marketers independent marketers and the depot owners have to be prevailed on to import kerosene massively if that is done you have kerosene all over the place
7439122 the issue of ap being the only one to be selling kerosene at n50 per litre is because ap which is owned by femi otedola has its own source it is a great importer femi otedola is the owner of zenon1 and 2 so he imports kerosene massively although he flagged up the programme of selling kerosene at the area of n50 per litre but we nupeng said it is not sustainable because it is not every depot owner or marketer has the type of billions of money that the otedolas family has so we thought it is good to import petroleum product massively the way otedola does because of the problem of transportation in the isles to nigerian territory so unless the nnpc is involved if the government prevails on the nnpc to massively import refined petroleum product which is kerosene things will not be alright the stand of nupeng is to fight for the society recently nupeng went on strike because of the high price of diesel and the deplorable state of public highways and dilapidated access route to oil installation when we are fighting for the society it is not our business if we want to go down or turn a blind eye it is the politicians that are supposed to work on the road but we turned our eyes away from the production of hydrocarbon and refined petroleum product to start looking into the management of our political economy the roads are bad the roads that connect the south to the north and the east to the west are in a state of decay so it is not only kerosene that is not available so the people should call on government to avert this problem
7439123 there is nothing nupeng can do apart from embarking on public outcry if we go on strike for too long more than we did it is nigerians that will suffer it especially the poor masses if we say because there is no kerosene there is no work it is the poor masses that would suffer it

7439194 this is new to us and we will probably have to do a lot of improvisation
7439195 we want students to feel like they have a voice on campus and we are that voice
7439196 we hear out what students want and communicate that to administrators
7439197 we want to focus on accomplishing tangible goals that students can see feel and touch

7439208 due to the circumstances maybe theyre playing a year before we really wanted them to
7439209 we lost some people but we see that as another challenge
7439210 honestly it was a challenge for the younger guys to step up
7439211 it was amazing that all five of them stuck together for five years of their careers
7439212 year after year they got better and better and we just called them the five blocks
7439213 they finished to the whistle and thats something i aspire to do when i get older and now
7439214 the original blocks are always going to be the original blocks
7439215 the offensive line is one of the strengths of this program and it really has been through the years
7439216 its going to be big shoes to fill but im here to make my own shoes
7439217 its not necessarily filling in shoes for kory but its filling in shoes for all the seniors that left
7439218 weve been working since the first morning meeting weve been going full speed ahead
7439219 especially making it to the bowl game and not finishing we want to make the big dance this year thats what were shooting for this year
7439220 the tradition of football here and the success weve had the last five years
7439221 to go that far and get a taste of what it was like has definitely made us more determined to get back there
7439222 we have a good group of guys that are capable of going very far this should be a fun year
7439223 we definitely feel that the strength of our team is all of the talent we have coming back
7439224 we return all of our forwards except for one and we have great leadership at the fly half position with nick viviani returning

7439238 were not out here to see who can write the most tickets we just want to help people but we have that as a last resort
7439239 students a lot of times will tell you a lot of things about whats going on
7439240 based upon my review and the need for public confidence in new orleans flood protection system i have concluded that an outside opinion is warranted
7439241 we will work closely with these independent reviewers to ensure that all issues are dealt with comprehensively and expeditiously and we are quite confident that when all is said and done the end result will be the same as the previous investigations and audits
7439242 we collected almost twice the amount needed and we still fell short
7439243 we made the issue as aware as possible and to fall 12 short on a highly debatable issue is very disheartening
7439244 id say about 80 percent to 85 percent of the signatures were discounted on that basis
7439245 the circulators listed addresses they dont reside at or dont live at
7439246 most of the addresses put down were business and not home addresses which made them invalid
7439247 a lot of people were really excited that we were doing something about this and we did everything we could do to make a change
7439248 it was my six days of being well it was like a trance it was so wonderful it was so great to be with my daughter again

7439250 one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states

7439252 im still tooling around with my speech a little bit it may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choices the american people are going to face in november
7439253 the fire was so intense theres not a lot of it left
7439254 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7439255 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness

7439284 the scrapbook industry has changed rapidly in the last five years
7439285 digital scrapbooking and photo books have become very popular ways to preserve your memories the majority of scrapbookers have digital cameras and for some of them it makes more sense to print a photo book rather than individual photos retailers in the traditional scrapbook industry have struggled to figure out how to capitalize on this trend the photobookbiz program is that answer to that question
7439286 the plug in or creative platform used to make these products is very user friendly yet innovative
7439287 visans exclusive smart arrangement technology makes creating a beautiful product or book easy for anyone who knows how to click and drag
7439288 two things are enabling us to establish this new paradigm
7439289 first is the advancement in microelectronics which provides us greater density and speed at much lower power consumption than ever before the other is a better understanding of neuroscience and how the brain functions at the synaptic neuronal network and system levels
7439290 the follow on phases of the project will create a technology that functions like the brain of a cat which comprises 108 neurons and 1012 synapses
7439291 the human brain has roughly 1011 neurons and 1015 synapses

7439297 o king of time the matter is delicate for good and evil chance are not to be told beforehand and against the decree of destiny there is no provision i suggest that you take the three princes armed with their bows and arrows up to the terrace of the palace and there after bandaging their eyes make them each turn round several times after that let them fire their arrows straight ahead of them and let the houses upon which the arrows fall be visited have the owners of the houses brought before you and ask of each his daughter in marriage for the marksman of the arrow which fell upon his house thus each of your sons will have a bride chosen by destiny

7439308 you know better than i do what is for the best
7439309 it is essential that our father should prefer the cooking of our house

7439311 i regret that i have to refuse your mistresss request but i have hardly enough rat and mouse dung for my own requirements
7439312 what harm have i done to your wives my sons that they should try to dig me a grave before my time
7439313 do you mock your old father when women can prepare such frightful foods do you expect me to touch the cooking of a tortoise i can see that you have all sworn to destroy me
7439314 that is only one of my wifes talents dear father
7439315 allah grant that she may some day find a chance really to earn your praises
7439316 see they are not content with strangling and poisoning me they wish to mock me before the people

7439333 by placing more pressure on your feet as you stand or walk the joints and ligaments have to work harder to maintain foot structure and the more pressure your feet have to accommodate the more your feet will splay or stretch out when you bear weight overtime your feet will stop bouncing back and they will eventually just stay wider
7439334 we see peoples misery every day of the week and its not just those with weight problems our shop staff and our 24 7 helpline are helping more and more customers who are in so much discomfort they just dont know what to do
7439335 so many people especially women fail to wear the right shoes they will flog their feet to death in ill fitting footwear because they wrongly believe they cant buy the right style and fashions at the right price in wider larger foot sizes
7439336 more and more brides are spending their big day in pain on what should be the happiest day of their lives

7439342 not just theology this is how all debates should be
7439343 when we watch commercial tv read newspapers attend weddings and sporting events or drive through our neighborhoods at easter religion all gets a free plug but to find something about skepticism you have to go look for it on the internet or at a bookstore
7439344 a new family of faith was born there was the ecstasy of a wedding with plenty of tears hugs and joy
7439345 we were viewing something that the world would take little notice of but that according to the bible the event had incredible eternal and spiritual importance

7439347 de parte da comiss o europ ia quero felicitar aos centenas de atletas europeus que participaram da olimp ada de beijing

7439350 our approach has been exceedingly effective for both young men and women we are uniquely positioned to give clients the wake up call of wilderness therapy as well as the counseling services and tools to stay clean and sober permanently
7439351 we are the only wilderness program out there that teaches daily living skills and helps clients acclimate to being in a community setting prior to discharge so the transition onward doesnt come as such a culture shock that gives each individual a chance to see how recovery will look for them not just in the wilderness but back in real life
7439352 by living and working with these young people day and night both in the unfamiliar wilderness setting and familiar base camp environment we can go beyond words and talk therapy and actually see how their substance abuse and co occurring issues impact their daily lives
7439353 in just two years we have established a strong national reputation for clinical excellence
7439354 our therapists travel all over the country to attend conferences develop new skills and improve the quality of their services their hard work has helped us make a name for ourselves in a relatively short period of time
7439355 the substance abuse field is relatively young so there is always room for improvement
7439356 one of our hallmarks is that were never satisfied with the status quo we are always evolving and finding new ways to provide the highest quality clinical services and state of the art treatment when it comes to substance abuse and co occurring mental health issues
7439357 over the past four years weve seen the gradual emergence of energy efficiency as an issue for data centre managers in the region but only this year did the issue break into the top five areas of concern in a big way
7439358 interestingly the survey also shows us that power densities in asia are following closely those found today in the u s where in the past american trends were not seen as a benchmark for asia we can now draw much closer parallels between the regions which has planning implications for all of us in addressing the issue at a regional scale
7439359 this response is symptomatic of an audience that has been barraged by conflicting information from the main industry players
7439360 this was the single most important problem we set out to rectify with the energy logic symposiums because confusion leads to inaction by bringing industry leaders and decision makers together weve sought to find a cohesive understanding of the issues and identify appropriate solutions
7439361 the best way to ensure energy efficiency is through a holistic approach that includes it equipment efficiencies best practice data centre design and efficient power and cooling infrastructure
7439362 energy logic is the first practical framework that can be used to measurably reduce energy costs by applying 10 technologies and best practices that have the greatest impact on energy efficiency in the data centre
7439363 adaptivexchange will take the concepts introduced by energy logic and transform them into practical actionable solutions that can immediately be implemented in computer rooms and data centres
7439364 the event represents a major forum for data centre professionals from around the region and through the user group and survey will be used to develop and share practical energy efficiency strategies on a regional scale i encourage anyone who has even a passing interest in energy efficiency to register today

7439390 we really wanted to mirror the authentic food experienced in regional mediterranean towns and villages where local produce is provided fresh on a daily basis and immediately used in traditional menus often following family recipes as a result the food is distinctive giving guests a tastier made to order and homemade farm to fork dining experience
7439391 there are several key aspects to mediterranean cooking and each one has been tackled with equal passion
7439392 the effort was time consuming but certainly worth it for example we even source our own wheat and wholegrain flour for the bakery baking all our own bread every day using fresh eggs and quality butter preparing food from scratch makes a huge difference our bread is now so popular that we bake extra so that local residents can come and collect their bread at counter culture our deli style restaurant on the ground level
7439393 i dont believe in fairy tales when it comes to funding credit requests there is no need to i know what banks and credit unions look at to fund credit cards and credit approvals

7439415 luvdarts are much more than just a mobile video download to the consumer they are digital greeting cards they can send to their family friends and lovers but to a business they are valuable tools in harnessing the power of word of mouth peer2peer advertising
7439416 well its a well known fact that the most effective marketing comes from personal recommendations by family and friends and there have never been greater opportunities for a business to market directly to consumers than the mobile space presents today the problem is how to get directly to the consumer without violating their privacy and rules set forth to protect the consumer by the wireless industry luvdarts get people to spread the word family to family friend to friend lover to lover and we let the businesses subsidize the activity
7439417 its simple we let a business run a campaign whenever they want to drive more traffic to their physical location or website s they can choose the start and end dates their target market daily download budget and incentives we then stock their luvdart downloading store with co branded luvdarts they distribute a code to their customers who can visit that store and download luvdarts free under the terms of that campaign
7439418 oh i get it the business pays for the download later at a wholesale price
7439419 thats right the business only pays for whats been downloaded to be clear there is a setup charge for each campaign
7439420 hmmm very interesting concept i see where people will want to send luvdarts to their family and friends as they also carry a businesses message and promotions without violating their privacy how are you going to get this going with businesses
7439421 thats a great question first we think any business that advertises in the yellow pages will be interested in a luvdarts campaign why the average business is paying a monthly amount for an ad they cant change for 12 months in the yellow pages we give them the ability to run a campaign of different sizes and targets whenever they please for local businesses as well as national that is huge the traffic that will come from a campaign is generated mainly from their existing patrons word of mouth and the business is able to control the times when it may need more traffic driven to its location
7439422 well it seems like youve got a winner here i will be watching your progress

7439536 what that demonstrates is the high degree of volatility that there is which we have always said whenever we have been asked at opec to do something and to put more oil in the market he said in an interview in lisbon today
7439537 such abrupt changes in the price of oil demonstrate that theres a component of financial speculation and of the decline in the value of the dollar

7439541 chrysler llc facing liquidity pressures amid a steep decline in the u s automotive market and rising commodity costs tapped a 2 billion credit line made available as part of its sale last year from daimler ag to cerberus capital management lp the move comes as chrysler scrambles to respond to a dramatic customer shift away from pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles which make up the majority of its product portfolio chrysler has also been stung by its relatively high reliance on the u s market which accounts for 90 of its sales the credit line was established in august when daimlerchrysler untied its nine year long partnership selling an 80 1 stake in chrysler to cerberus a chrysler spokeswoman had no immediate comment on what the money will be used for and why it was drawn at this time daimler reported the loan tuesday

7439582 this is a classic move to try to jump start a failing car line said john wolkonowicz an analyst at global insight inc
7439583 it might sell a few more cars but because the fundamental car is not that desired to begin with its not going to have that big of an impact

7439585 given where fuel prices are at im not sure that people are following the old progression that the higher the trim level the bigger the engine
7439586 chrysler needs to hit what the customer wants and that may be a 4 cylinder engine with leather seats and a navigation system
7439587 we will always look for ways to improve our product based on customer feedback
7439588 weve been criticized for the quality of our interiors putting a premium interior in a mid range car could go a long way to fixing that perception
7439589 if chrysler is going to offer a better interior at a better price that sounds like nice formula to me
7439590 having any need for incremental cash based on financial performance of the business
7439591 the company has exceeded all of its financial targets it set for itself from the day we closed the transaction on aug 3 the truth behind the 2 billion is that it was a contractual obligation we had to the company and we were simply meeting our obligation as it came due and it is reflective of our confidence in the ability of the company to weather the storm and move forward
7439592 this new achievement helps to establish the jeep compass and patriot as industry leaders and proves that it is possible to offer global customers fuel efficiency and capability in the same package
7439593 jeep offers a full line of vehicles powered by efficient diesel engines and we are committed to furthering our efforts to reduce fuel consumption and co2 emissions in fact at the new chrysler we are redesigning our business model with a greater emphasis on fuel efficient products with features that the customers want and need
7439594 we already knew that the compass and patriot were among the most economical of all suvs but we were amazed by the fuel efficiency that these two vehicles were capable of during this drive
7439595 we drove on normal roads at realistic speeds with two people and their luggage on board and the traffic and weather conditions werent favorable at all cold with many traffic jams we used simple fuel economy driving techniques that any driver could replicate
7439596 this record achievement challenges the myth that all suvs are gas guzzlers weve proven in everyday driving conditions just how fuel efficient these two jeep suvs can be
7439597 son never discuss your religion politics or the family business
7439598 opecs continued assertion that the world is well supplied with oil does not stand up to scrutiny the report said
7439599 not enough oil is being produced to meet world demand and this has been the case since the middle of 2006
7439600 gross over estimation cges said non opec production was down around 330 000 barrels a day in the first half according to the report
7439601 the company has established itself in the us through its cost effective engineering and manufacturing base in india
7439602 first things first if you are running a race with hurdles jump the first hurdle first
7439603 the reason we have oil at 130 140 145 a barrel like a roman candle going up up up is because we have excessive relentless speculation in these markets
7439604 nothing in supply and demand in the last year justifies the price of oil
7439605 as is customary for many auto finance companies this renewal process takes place every year
7439606 we will continue to offer competitive financing and lease options for our customers and dealers

7439620 i keep saying that cerberus is running chrysler like a financial institution and not like a car company
7439621 and now in june when everybody is selling the crap out of cars chrysler is 50 off of last junes car sales numbers
7439622 capital raising options seem limited to us given a lack of high value unencumbered assets and its owners are probably not highly motivated to inject new equity
7439623 the biggest difference is as a private company they can make decisions quickly
7439624 in bankruptcy they could renegotiate or terminate contracts with the uaw dealers and suppliers
7439625 build it and they will come for noting happens until a sale is made
7439626 old books old friends old wine thats about all they are in life
7439627 it is far better to dare mighty things to win glorious triumphs even though checkered by failure than to take rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much because they live in the gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat
7439628 i think the days of seeing record prices every other day for 60 days running are behind us

7439647 they basically premium price for the risk and the cost of that borrowing has increased dramatically
7439648 we really reached a point today in this environment where the advantages of leasing the economic advantages of leasing have really disappeared
7439649 they really look for the monthly payment when they go to the dealership
7439650 it hasnt been a major problem for us at this point in time
7439651 oh mr customer you can get the same payment or even lower it over leasing
7439652 leasing is about 70 percent of our new car business
7439653 going to target the lease clients right now boy lets jump on the train because its left the station on july 31 and its not coming back
7439654 two years ago we used to do 40 percent leasing and this year its about 10 percent

7439667 under lous leadership envi will develop electric propulsion vehicles that will provide customers with more fuel efficient vehicle options
7439668 supplying these cars from china or anywhere around the world quickly and then investing in new models to capture market share might have saved chrysler

7439678 we acknowledge that india does have a good track record of non proliferation but nevertheless it remains outside of the npt it has developed tested and possesses nuclear weapons
7439679 what we would like to see ideally are a range of conditions which would apply to india if the exemption is given
7439680 we dont think that anything we are asking for is unreasonable
7439681 were not trying to obstruct indias ability to receive supplies of material and technology for a civilian nuclear capacity and therefore should not be objectionable to either india or the us
7439682 i dont know anyone that wouldnt pay 3 5 because theyd be paying it in their 40 minutes of car running
7439683 the agenda was secret until maurice blurted it and the prospect of having the 50 extra tax cut they promised the average worker snatched away by the weekly toll bill of course makes it clear their policies are all about taking with one hand giving with the other
7439684 if theres going to be tolling where they are paying then government should be looking at whether it can offset that by lower petrol prices
7439685 its very hard to know where all of it is going
7439686 ten bucks each way and thats a very very high price threshold
7439687 user charges for public schools and hospitals significant and high tolls for road users and an increase in government debt to overseas lenders in order to pay for its irresponsible tax policies

7439694 it is the jpcs hope that the competition will contribute to the emerging appropriate architecture debate and form part of a watershed from which will flow a new understanding of appropriate local design processes

7439697 i dont begrudge a single cent of the money spent preparing our athletes for the olympics
7439698 i think most kiwis would feel very proud of the achievements of the team
7439699 well need to see the detailed debrief and look at how much needs to go into the next effort
7439700 the reality is you cant compete at this very top level of international sport like the olympics as a gifted amateur you have to have the whole envelope of support around you and that costs
7439701 we can never be totally happy the world is moving on in terms of performance and if we stay still we will get further behind so what that means is that in our review which will take place when we get back we have to look for another edge
7439702 i admire the jonas brothers because they are all so down to earth and all of them really remember where they come from and they stay grounded unlike alot of other famous people

7439710 my jobs all come out nicely but when i had crews going i just had ongoing headaches

7439712 this isnt rocket science one of the historic advantages small businesses have over bigger businesses is the ability to react quickly to change
7439713 but small businesses do have opportunities to work through it just by virtue of being small
7439714 there are no insurmountable problems there are just solutions that remain undiscovered
7439715 any business can take a look at any aspect of whats its doing to reduce waste and become more efficient weve seen this over the year on the hr side a trend towards subcontracting out instead of having the paper burden thats attached with having employees
7439716 do you really need to own the asset or are there alternatives that would get you the use you need without actually owning it and carrying the costs that are associated with it
7439717 i just hire sub contractors to come in and do that part of the job
7439718 otherwise a piece of equipment worth 30 000 is sitting there doing nothing for two to three days a week

7439757 for a government to treat a revered religious institution and leader in such a discriminatory manner is an affront to human and religious rights and shows disrespect to the hundreds of millions of orthodox christians
7439758 there must be fairness and freedom when it comes to the turkish governments treatment of the ecumenical patriarchate as turkey appeals to the european union for membership i would expect its treatment of the ecumenical patriarchate to be a prime topic that must be addressed
7439759 as a tinkerer and inventor my whole life this book addresses a topic that is near and dear to my heart at apple steve and i were successful because we followed the path outlined by peter and tats in this book and didnt fall prey at least not too often to inventoritis ive learned over time that getting inventions to the marketplace is at least as important as the product itself it was much harder to get people to accept the concept of a computer into their homes and lives than to design it too many inventors fall prey to the field of dreams syndrome this book will drill home the importance of getting your product to market its a must read for any inventor
7439760 the innovators dilemma the revolutionary book that will change the way you do business collins business essentials

7439774 at the time the impact of the campaign was closely monitored and it was estimated that about 190 000 australians quit smoking she told reporters in melbourne today
7439775 very few health programs save more than they cost but the ntc did she said
7439776 when this campaign was launched 10 years ago it was the first time that smokers really saw real life situations of what happened to their bodies as a result of their habit fiona sharkie executive director of quit victoria said
7439777 not to the best of my recollection but there is material being gathered by the department about the child concerned so there may well be something that i dont recall but as youll appreciate it is a long time ago she said
7439778 i think it would be wrong of me because its very complex human issues that are involved in this she said
7439779 this is about a child and an adoptive family thats gone out of its way and done their best to give a child a new life and to make a family
7439780 equally there are birth parents who have equally suffered so the ultimate outcome here is one that i dont think any of us can know yet
7439781 in three of those four were awaiting senate inquiry outcomes thats the sensible thing to do he said in canberra
7439782 the governments got its budget and it wants to get it through in the main senator brown said
7439783 if you take billions of dollars out of it then youve got to be able to say where you would elsewise get that money
7439784 i think its much better to have some constructive dialogue going on rather than telling people who are properly elected to this national pprliament by the people of australia to get out of the way senator brown said
7439785 the idea that the government is elected to do what it wants was found to be unpopular
7439786 maybe the prime minister hasnt yet got a good bead on where the greens are coming from senator brown said

7439792 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7439793 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7439794 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7439795 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7439796 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7439797 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7439798 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7439799 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7439800 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7439801 no i havent are you doing some sort of enterprise wide directory integration
7439802 im sorry no i havent even heard the term what is ldap and how are you using it

7439824 they can see its not a huge problem some have even gone out on activities on tours or sand biking
7439825 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people

7439869 throughout the years dockwise has been engaged in projects for different international navies with a large variety of naval equipment involved mobilizing or demobilizing military naval equipment on its own power is for different reasons not always possible the capacity of the dockwise vessels often allows for creative and unorthodox solutions apart from other arguments such as safety security reduction of wear and tear and predetermined arrival targets the contribution of these contracts once again indicates the importance of the market diversity on which the dockwise strategy is built

7439880 being in the olympic village is an incredible reflection of the power of sport to unite people
7439881 national pride is everywhere but you really do feel a part of something bigger
7439882 ive been to a few world cup competitions now but they cannot even compare to this experience
7439883 it means so much more because you are a part of something bigger than your own sport
7439884 there is so much pride in being a part of the whole canadian olympic team and being amongst so many of the worlds best athletes not just soccer players
7439885 im not sure if there has ever been a time in my travels where ive mentioned that i go to ucla and someone has not known about the school and had not had something good to say about it
7439886 whenever i discuss ucla overseas it is usually a great conversation
7439887 we play against a bunch of girls that have played polo in the states so sometimes the competition looks familiar
7439888 the olympic games are a struggle of highs and lows managing the victories and working through the adversities of competition
7439889 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
7439890 has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
7439891 has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite u s presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality while sen mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
7439892 were monitoring closely and will have something to say when an agreement is finalized
7439893 at this point obama looks a little less reckless than he might have a few months ago
7439894 i dont think this gets the issue off the table
7439895 between now and election day not a lot of troops are going to come home
7439896 has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
7439897 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
7439898 there clearly is a little more sternness in the warning coming out from epa and thats ok
7439899 sure there will be some people who will think twice and three times before they do it
7439900 in this country everyone talks about becoming energy independent not having to rely on foreign sources of oil but it seems as though every time there is a push to make something work there is someone out there trying to beat it back
7439901 i hope my gift along with donations from many others will help make it possible for the talented scientists and physicians at ucla to develop a cure and eventually prevent alzheimers disease
7439902 our center has a therapeutic imperative and finding treatment to slow the disease course resonated with easton
7439903 what mr easton has done is permit some people who have already been funded to do research to search to do something that is higher risk and higher reward
7439904 ive seen a lot of class action suits with less to it than this particular case
7439905 thats money i could have put in my childrens college fund

7439955 if shah rukh khan is being attacked its a clear sign of him being the most successful personality in the hindi film industry when a person is on top he or she automatically loses the sympathy quotient that an underdog can get naturally there will be plenty of people to criticise him in every possible way
7439956 its very unfortunate but bollywood is definitely divided these days earlier stars like vinod khanna amitabh bachchan and rajesh khanna would indulge in healthy competition but today the rivalry has gone to the streets
7439957 i am unable to understand its srks shows falling interest as the graphs show despite the fact that they were presented by a bigger and more popular star namely shah rukh
7439958 shahrukh is licking my feet and i am feeding him biscuits every now and then what more can i ask for well shahrukh is once again begging for my attention so let me get back to him he is smelling too much i think he needs a bath heel boy heel
7439959 shah rukh is easily the most successful brand in india and he is in a position not to be scared of competition
7439960 srk has reached a position in his career where such attacks wont affect his box office clout i think such acts are only meant to create hype for the people behind them
7439961 we deny our relationships affairs infidelities and enmities we love denial god forbid if we started admitting to things the speculation would stop and we just cant have that we like to be in the news
7439962 shah rukh khan also known as king khan is the biggest star in hindi cinema and this means billions of fans bollywood has a global audience of 3 6 billion hollywood has 2 5 billion maybe its just that he is the biggest film star in the world and that is enough of a reason in itself to keep people waiting in this country few people outside asian communities and bollywood fans have heard of him and yet he sells out the wembley arena in minutes when he comes here to perform song and dance routines from his films
7439963 srk has a big advantage unparalleled fan following across the world and when a company ropes him in a brand endorser he guarantees a certain magnetic quality thats the reason why he is forever in demand
7439964 i wont deny that there is a problem between us there has been this animosity between us for sometime now in fact this is the third time we have fought we have tried being friends but it just doesnt seem possible we are different people

7439978 it was good in the way that it wasnt a racist film but there were too many stupid historical inaccuracies in it this is way too complicated material to get in the hands of the americans

7439987 as a walker were not race walkers we dont usually like the power gels that runners use were able to eat gummi bears some people have even done peanut butter and honey sandwiches
7439988 it takes a lot of determination for someone who wants to walk a full marathon
7439989 we definitely see the walkers as an area thats growing
7439990 a lot of people register as runners for some reason theres a stigma attached to walking so they dont want to register as a walker
7439991 weve gotten some feedback from the runners that there are definitely more walkers out there
7439992 we enjoy having the walkers there we understand theyre a big part of the race
7439993 the patients do feel a tingle in their scalp which is not at all unpleasant that is really our only side effect and it is not at all a problem it merely indicates to the patient that there has been a treatment medications are somewhat effective but they all have side effects our treatment has zero side effects
7439994 those with the placebo device the headache eventually went away by itself
7439995 the headaches in all the subjects went away but it went away much faster for those using the device than those not using the device

7439999 migraine is a mechanism that is built into the human brain we all possess it and it becomes active by an efficient build up of its triggers
