9210067 americans are just beginning to discover that gov palin is an experienced executive who has held office since 1992 and demonstrated time and again her willingness to roll up her sleeves and taken action

9210085 for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth
9210086 there are thousands of villages in the world that have no school no clinic no business no government but they have a church what would happen if we could mobilize churches to address those five global giants
9210087 the future of the world is not secularism but religious pluralism
9210088 we cannot solve these problems without involving people of faith and their religious institutions it isnt going to happen any other way on this planet there are about 20 million jews there are about 600 million buddhists there are about 800 million hindus there are over 1 billion muslims and there are 2 3 billion christians if you take people of faith out of the equation you have ruled out five sixths of the world and if we only leave it up to secular people to solve these major problems it isnt going to happen
9210089 whos the man of peace in any village or it might be a woman of peace who has the most respect they dont have to be christian in fact they could be muslim but theyre open and theyre influential and you work with them to attack the five giants to which he has added global warming
9210090 i get it rick houses of worship are the distribution centers for all we need to do
9210091 there are some religious leaders in different religious faiths who in seeking to affirm their own faith and its authenticity and legitimacy deny other people their faith with its legitimacy and authenticity i dont think we can keep going like this without spawning the kind of hatred we are all here to try and solve i think its up to us to hold the clergys feet to the fire of whatever faith that we insist that we affirm what is beautiful in our own traditions while at the same time refusing to denigrate other faith traditions by suggesting that they are illegitimate or consigned to some kind of evil end
9210092 neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name jesus christ under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him
9210093 yes but they are a massive volunteer force and distribution outlet of resources for slaying the giants of world suffering
9210094 by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god
9210095 i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
9210096 for our conversation citizenship is in heaven from whence also we look for the savior the lord jesus christ
9210097 god didnt go to all the trouble of sending his son merely to point an accusing finger telling the world how bad it was he came to help to put the world right again
9210098 salvation is the entire universe being brought back into harmony with its maker this has huge implications for how people present the message of jesus yes jesus can come into our hearts but we can join a movement that is as wide and as big as the universe itself rocks and trees and birds and swamps and ecosystems gods desire is to restore all of it the goal isnt escaping this world but making this world the kind of place god can come to and god is remaking us into the kind of people who can do this kind of work
9210099 i think our future will also require us to join humbly and charitably with people of other faiths muslim hindu buddhist jewish secularists and others in pursuit of peace environmental stewardship and justice for all people things that matter greatly to the heart of god
9210100 this world the kind of place god can come to
9210101 when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth
9210102 some indeed preach christ even of envy and strife and some also of good will the one preach christ of contention not sincerely supposing to add affliction to my bonds but the other of love knowing that i am set for the defense of the gospel what then notwithstanding every way whether in pretence or in truth christ is preached and i therein do rejoice yea and will rejoice
9210103 christ is preached and i therein do rejoice yea and will rejoice
9210104 a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death
9210105 i am the lord and there is none else and there is no god beside me
9210106 i even i am the lord and beside me there is no saviour
9210107 looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus christ
9210108 neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name jesus christ under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved
9210109 i jesus christ am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
9210110 if righteousness come by the law then christ is dead in vain
9210111 in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness
9210112 the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience
9210113 be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness and what concord hath christ with belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel
9210114 and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity
9210115 california statutes permit home schooling as a species of private school education
9210116 it is unusual for an appellate court to grant a petition for rehearing as this court did in march

9210126 dat evenemententerrein is bedoeld voor festivals denk aan popfestival metropolis nelson mandela maar ook het dunya festival kunnen we er neerzetten of een beurs voor oldtimers ook kunnen we er samen met ahoy iets organiseren tijdens north sea jazz
9210127 denk aan het familiefestival op 31 augustus of de zuiderparkspelen op 21 september

9210139 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9210140 they have been doing everything but jumping up and down and screaming
9210141 you hear people say that so and so has about as much foreign policy experience as my wife has or my daughter has but in this case its going to be true

9210148 i could probably have gotten a degree in journalism at the university of idaho in my sleep
9210149 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
9210150 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
9210151 were supposed to vote for her just because of her gender
9210152 were supposed to vote for him just because of his skin tone
9210153 i know lets smear the first female vp presidential candidate in the history of the united states yeah thatll go over super good with the chicks
9210154 unless the president is an ancient person with recurrent cancer
9210155 also the standard dem response is to try to paint this as a desperation move by comparing palin to quayle wont work quayle was just a freakin idiot and get this gerry ferraro
9210156 ive got george in dc on standby together we can
9210157 then its crucial that the vp can fill the role of president
9210158 im with you on obama messing it up for us
9210159 one its a cheap attempt to undercut the democrats and if we fall for it as feminists we suck
9210160 two this choice shows you how bad the republicans are on womens issues they didnt have any other women then this complete unknown at least the democrats have at least ten high profile powerful women other then hillary and here is the comment that is going to piss some people off but its the truth what is a woman her age doing having a child we all know that the older you are the more likely your child will be born with birth defects be responsible and dont get pregnant after you know its not safe this is coming from a woman whose mom had a baby to late in life and now my deaf mute mentally challenged brother lives with me and my new husband
9210161 it makes me sick because clinton got beat to fuck against that glass ceiling until she was black and blue only for the fucking republicans to make use of her sacrifice while the democrats gave us a total dipshit who made fun of his wife being educated in his acceptance speech
9210162 but it is precisely the substance not the style of obamas oratory that has been winning over his audiences
9210163 i didnt mean it you know i love you where ya gonna go youre nuthin without me ya hear nuthin
9210164 has palin ever even been to another country she has absolutely zero foreign policy experience
9210165 and i cant stand the thought of this woman getting to be the first female president maybe ill have to hold out for chelsea
9210166 to any critics who say a woman cant think and work and carry a baby at the same time id just like to escort that neanderthal back to the cave

9210169 new york state senator bill perkins used quite explicit racial stereotyping in a speech aimed at discouraging his constituents from voting for clinton by saying harlem
9210170 do you know those were slums do you know they shut off the heat in the winter you know that right
9210171 we should all be proud of governor sara palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governer palin will add an important new voice to this debate
9210172 were supposed to vote for her just because of her gender
9210173 were supposed to vote for him just because of his skin tone
9210174 i know lets smear the first female vp presidential candidate in the history of the united states yeah thatll go over super good with the chicks
9210175 religion as a litmus test or anybodys personal opinion on evolution or creationism

9210181 new york state senator bill perkins used quite explicit racial stereotyping in a speech aimed at discouraging his constituents from voting for clinton by saying harlem
9210182 we value having subliterates tell us that were obviously too stupid to know our own names
9210183 oh yea c and jeff sorry but you dont get to count un democratic caucuses when youre counting these states obama supposedly done doesnt count not democratic and way too much evidence of nasty cheating in those so when you dont count those guess what we have a statistical tie
9210184 people ignore this aspect of our discontent and whistle dixie like it doesnt matter but its the reason im puma
9210185 uhh if i choose a woman for vp ill get all of the women who wouldve voted for hillary to vote for me
9210186 vote obama work to fix the dnc then kick him out in 2012 and get hillary into office
9210187 i dont believe obama can beat mccain now he blew it not picking hillary
9210188 if they were in the schoolyard colin montgomerie and ian poulter would probably have their heads banged together or at least their sponsored visors

9210197 concluzia nu incerca sa faci o fapta buna in romania ca te arzi la propriu
9210198 it was very clear from the beginning that we did not want to make some kind of cause documentary thats a genre like everything is going to be okay and here are the heroes
9210199 they msf doctors dont view themselves like that they are humans they are doing quite extraordinary stuff in crazy situations but it would be disingenuous to the actual reality of the situation to turn it into one of those standard cliches
9210200 obviously i would have loved it if we could have met in the finals but right now we are both working hard just to get to the quarterfinals
9210201 i am not looking forward to meeting her i would say because shes playing so well right now i am looking at how to get past her
9210202 i just hope to continue moving well and serving well
9210203 i just want to focus on continuing to play well
9210204 this is where the big things happened for serena and i first me having the final here her winning the slam and us winning the doubles the same year
9210205 so there has been a lot of firsts for us
9210206 since the last time i won here i played about just about four times missed a couple years so you know that wasnt ideal but i still had some solid results here
9210207 but theres really no secret about winning you got to play better than everybody else so thats just what i got to do
9210208 the contrasts between us and the republicans could not be starker especially on issues that matter to middle class families
9210209 with barack obama in the white house and democrats leading in congress we will lead the charge to revitalize the economy create jobs make college affordable again and enable hardworking americans to pay for gas food utilities and cover the monthly bills
9210210 democrats will continue to fight to lower gas prices as we are doing now in congress even as john mccain and the republicans side with big oil
9210211 i for one cant wait to watch president barack obama with the support of a democratic congress sign into law universal health care that covers every single american
9210212 john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and hes promised tax breaks for the biggest corporations instead of middle class families and in 2008 he still thinks its ok that women arent earning equal pay for equal work
9210213 as hillary clinton aptly stated senator mccain has a lifetime of experience
9210214 he will use that experience as president to keep taxes low for american families and small businesses grow the economy and reduce our nations independence on foreign oil
9210215 if you could come to care about them by the end of the film then i think that that was in a way a more political act than what a well meaning documentary could achieve
9210216 you are just humanizing people who for so long have been marginalized to an issue or to an exotic location
9210217 my two otherwise identical monitors display colors that are slightly but visibly different
9210218 coach talley has a veteran staff and they have 17 starters and 33 lettermen back from a 7 4 football team
9210219 this team is supposed to make a run at their conference and im hoping they do i wish them nothing but the best but im also hoping they dont do that until september
9210220 i think they can play with any d 1 school in the nation theyre a pretty good team
9210221 theyre well coached defensively and they run around well so we have to come prepared ready to play
9210222 i think weve got a lot of weapons on the offense and also on defense weve got jock sanders at slot pat at quarterback me at running back and bradley starks at wide receiver were going to throw the ball up in the air a lot so i figure its going to be hard to stop our offense and our defense is going to be there
9210223 thats what im mostly looking forward to is to prove myself
9210224 im real impressed with jock also i think a lot of players are hes going to be a big surprise to a lot of teams that dont know too much about him
9210225 i feel hes going to replace d ray darius reynaud and also going to be a lot better than d ray was
9210226 its different coaching its a lot better coaching than what we had last year and hes understanding the game better than he did last year
9210227 the new coaches and everybody that came in i learned so much from my freshman year just different perspectives of the game like different coverages when i first came here i just thought just get the ball and run
9210228 now you just look at the game more different if you know the defensive front and everything
9210229 it doesnt really matter anyway they can get the ball in my hands i try to get the ball and just do what i got recruited for make people miss
9210230 you know everybody be hyped up because of the first game everybodys ready to see the mountaineers get back at it everybodys just trying to be patient and just get through this first game
9210231 i definitely think its an exciting time for him a special time we just want to be able to live the moment with him
9210232 at at the end of the third reich collapse there was a dash across europe to recover v 2 missiles and components
9210233 as for germany itself the reaction of germany in the aftermath of 9 11 really showed up that when push comes to shove not a lot had changed
9210234 he was arrested for off the cuff remarks he made at some party that brought into question his loyalty to the f hrer
9210235 von braun had been obsessed with space rocketry since childhood
9210236 we give you the money power and resources to build your rockets and you do it for our purposes
9210237 so was von braun an apolitical scientist or a nazi war criminal
9210238 i didnt want to overwhelm the reader with a heavy handed message you draw your own conclusions
9210239 i had suggested that guys like balkman were not difficult to find and took qite a bit of flak for that
9210240 we have seized the opportunity to strengthen the midfield and provide competition for places
9210241 jo has been on different lists of mine for over two years and hes someone we have closely monitored
9210242 hes something different a player we feel will add to the squad
9210243 he can play as a wide man a striker and a bit of both and we believe his versatility will benefit us
9210244 he is a player who comes here with a good reputation he went out on loan to southend last season and did very well
9210245 incluso la necropsia que es una prueba que no estaba prevista se ha realizado a la brevedad con personal de trujillo y con la participaci n de las rondas y los abogados de las partes agraviadas hay una voluntad de llevar este proceso para llegar a los resultados lo m s pronto posible
9210246 se hizo un arduo trabajo en todo lo que fue rescatar la verdad pero en el tema de la reconciliaci n tenemos que avanzar la tarea de la cvr es importante pero falta difusi n del informe final algunas personas que opinan no necesariamente lo han le do
9210247 la tarea es brindar mucha m s informaci n a diversos p blicos y todos ir avanzando en el esfuerzo de verificar el avance que hemos tenido en el tema de las recomendaciones de la cvr me parece que es un tema de informaci n comunicaci n y compromiso tanto del estado como de la sociedad civil
9210248 in the past the location of the companys winery at the barkan area caused a negative image and made difficult the exporting of the barkan brands the company is acting to change this image especially in light of moving production activity to kibutz hulda due to severe limitation caused by the size of the barkan location as well as due to problems connected with operating a winery beyond the green line the company decided to remove the winery from the barkan industrial zone and relocate it to the hulda site
9210249 since this is one vineyard out of many owned by this company and since its general trend of dissociation from settlement activity is very clear we hope that this last connection would be severed shortly

9210263 das auto war toll aber man braucht nicht nur ein gutes auto man darf auch keinen fehler machen
9210264 aber wir sind nur so weit hinten weil ich gestern aussetzten musste
9210265 wir mussten mit der reifenwahl f r das rennen bis zum nachmittag warten damit wir f r die hitze die passende mischung w hlen konnten
9210266 wir werden sehen ob wir im warm up nicht doch noch ein paar fortschritte machen k nnen
9210267 es ist frustrierend nach einem wochenende wie br nn hierher zu kommen und letzter zu werden
9210268 ich kann einfach nicht am limit durch die schikanen gehen
9210269 leider hatten wir mehr probleme mit den qualifying reifen als andere
9210270 die pace auf rennreifen war viel besser als es unsere startpositionen vermuten lassen

9210283 ha sido un d a impresionante si nos hubi ramos puesto todos de acuerdo para ponerlo tan emocionante no lo habr amos hecho tan bien en la primera regata nos fijamos demasiado en el matador a quien tuvimos que ganar y descuidamos un poco el resto de la flota quantum y desafio hicieron bien su trabajo y al acabar la regata nos dimos cuenta que desafio lideraba el trofeo y empat bamos con quantum en segundos con lo cual ten amos que ponernos las pilas el comit hizo un trabajo fenomenal al esperar hasta el ltimo momento para que entrase m s viento y era a muerte en la ultima ce ida nos fuimos demasiado para la izquierda y se nos colaron en aquel momento ellos eran los ganadores por poco nos da un infarto con poco viento era dif cil a acertar pero conseguimos pasarles para asegurarnos el primer puesto en los ltimos metros personalmente he sufrido hasta incluso despu s de llegar aun no me lo puedo creer al brib n ya le tocaba ganar un trofeo este a o estuvimos a punto en alicante y al final se nos escap hemos estado todo el a o luchando para ganar uno y hemos sufrido hasta los ltimos metros el hecho que haya navegado tan bien el matador a n da mucho m s valor a la victoria desde luego no ha sido nada f cil
9210284 fue bastante duro pero muy divertido y nos hemos peleado hasta el final durante dos regatas en condiciones muy variables e inestables evidentemente nos habr a gustado ganar pero quedamos segundos peleando hasta la ltima boya nos falto muy poco la pr xima vez ser en la primera prueba nos gust la derecha y quisimos estar cerca del brib n de ah en adelante no tomamos decisiones inteligentes y cometimos algunos errores que nos costaron caros pero cuando supimos que hab a una segunda regata enseguida nos concentramos para luchar en la siguiente y es lo que hicimos el campo de regatas no daba respiro porque a pesar de haber poco viento rolaba mucho fue realmente dif cil despu s de la decepci n de la primera pusimos la cabeza en positivo para salir a pelear cuando no ganas pero sabes que lo has dado todo intent ndolo el sabor de boca es bueno y estamos muy contentos ahora viene portugal esto ha sido el segundo puesto consecutivo ahora nos toca ganar
9210285 hemos sido muy competitivos y es un gran cambio en cada regata el desafio est cada vez m s fuerte y hoy hemos tenido el mejor d a de la temporada no fue suficiente para recuperar totalmente pero ayer est bamos a nueve puntos del primer puesto y hoy acabamos el trofeo con s lo cuatro puntos de diferencia estamos muy satisfechos con la tendencia de seguir subiendo el nivel y el rendimiento y aunque nos habr a gustado que el trofeo acabar tras la primera regata terminar con los puntos tan ajustados fue fant stico ya somos capaces de ganar pruebas y tenemos mucha m s confianza conocemos mejor el barco y estamos navegando mejor en general

9210291 governor palins lack of experience especially in national security and foreign affairs raises immediate questions about how prepared she is to potentially succeed to the presidency that really is the only criterion for judging a candidate for vice president
9210292 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9210293 i want the counsel and advice of somebody whos not going to agree with me 100 percent of time in fact somebody whats independent enough that can push back and give me different perspectives and make sure that im catching any blind spots that i have

9210326 the second barack obama becomes president the al capone era and the extent to which that still defines chicago for a lot of people around the world is over
9210327 i think my phone calls will be answered which is good and i can sit down and work with barack on priorities for our state
9210328 i want to invest in existing programs existing rta cta metra programs that definitely need a capital infusion barack understands that
9210329 if he was to win our chances would significantly improve
9210330 with the 76 votes you need and looking at how theyre distributed around the world his victory would be key
9210331 you can only bring it to a certain point and then your national leadership has to be for that and they have to do certain things
9210332 the commercial and intellectual center of policy will be chicago
9210333 without question to have the president of the united states come from the city where your company is headquartered is a huge plus for any business in chicago
9210334 its always a plus to have the administration understand the business
9210335 there was this magnet that drew people to find out more to try to make a connection that might open a door to the president of the united states
9210336 the economic agenda hes put forward certainly should be concerning for a city with the kind of economic base that chicago has
9210337 its exciting and something that any city should be prepared to take advantage of

9210339 energy and food prices are soaring the housing market continues to collapse government revenue is falling and taxes are rising airlines are jacking up fares and fees while reducing service banks are pulling credit lines auto companies are cutting production once again even investment bankers are losing their jobs the tendency is to see these as separate developments each with its own causes and dynamic fundamentally however they are all part of the same story the story of the global economy purging itself of large and unsustainable imbalances that for a time allowed many americans to think they were richer than they really were
9210340 for the richest country on the planet certainly not but it does represent the end of a decade or more during which americans were permitted and even encouraged by the rest of the world and by their own leaders to live way beyond their means as a result the united states has gone from being the largest creditor nation to the worlds largest debtor for the first time since the early 1980s americans will have to endure several years of uncomfortably slow growth and uncomfortably high inflation as the u s economy regains its balance and creates a foundation for more solid and sustainable growth
9210341 the housing crisis hit me closer to home i learned over the weekend that my parents are headed into foreclosure theyre only a few days away from the 60 day late mark my parents dont have a toxic mortgage or anything but they do live beyond their means my dads almost 62 and hes been out of a job since dec 2007 like typical boomers they have no savings or retirement plans whatsoever
9210342 somehow my parents went through life and never learned how to save or trim expenses they have all the bells and whistles they have two cars use lots of gas eat lots of fast food have the most expensive cable package live in a 3 bedroom house for 2 people buy lots and lots of cheap imported trinkets from wal mart give their grandchildren toys everytime they seen them tivo netflix tru green lawn service cell phone cable internet internet home phone and the list goes on and on if they pared every expenses down to the bare minimum they could save the house on my moms salary but they simply are not prepared to make the sacrifices necessary to do so and trying to explain this to them makes them vehemently upset
9210343 im not in a position to help them out financially right now because i use every extra penny i have to pay off my private student loans
9210344 if i wanted to reduce my extra principal payments i could easily cover their mortgage every month but i dont know if i want to theyve got 25 years left on their mortgage long term when they live solely off social security they wont be able to afford the mortgage anyway
9210345 a fine mother and an up and coming public servant

9210350 john mccain was able to weave in his experience in a vietnam prison camp no matter what the question was
9210351 its much better than talking about how hes changed his total character between being a senator a kind of a maverick at the time and his acquiescence in the last few months with every kind of lobbyist pressure that the right wing republicans have presented to him
9210352 there are so many important and interesting multimedia packages being developed by university students and snd wants to see them

9210356 ms optons photographs part of a series called the soldier billboard project have been displayed on billboards in syracuse and one was on a billboard in denver during the democratic national convention but the company that owns the minneapolis st paul billboards cbs outdoor part of the larger media conglomerate canceled her contract last week having decided that the pictures sent a confusing and inappropriate message
9210357 these projects are a perfect fit for the goal of this competition which focuses on research that will give decision makers the scientific tools they need to face future challenges
9210358 this is the sort of information that must be built into sound public policy innovation and strategic development moving us forward into an era of mitigation and adaptation to climate change and associated factors
9210359 good science is crucial to the development of informed effective public policy
9210360 investment in the work of our highly skilled researchers like this funding from cfcas is canadas best hope for addressing important issues such as climate change and air quality

9210365 we are in favour of registration as per the registration conditions we have to bring about reforms in the partys constitution it requires to hold partys council to reform constitution but under the sate of emergency we cannot call council meeting complete withdrawal of the state of emergency is the pre condition for reforms in the party
9210366 the phenomenon of climate change is not a myth but a hard scientific reality
9210367 we must take comprehensive and integrated steps to combat the adverse effects of global warming on food security
9210368 bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to climate change given its geography as a low lying mega delta with three large river systems accompanied by heavy rainfall floods have become an annual calamity
9210369 the challenge of climate change brings countries and regions together in ways weve never known before the fate of our nations the future of all rich and poor in europe in asia and in every corner of the world have become absolutely intertwined
9210370 if four pillars of modern society scientific communities governments business sectors and civic associations can unite and combine their resources we can build the foundations for enormous success
9210371 we therefore need a similar call to action a visionary collaboration between brilliant minds accompanied by an invitation to all concerned citizens to become involved to be heard and counted
9210372 i dont like it going someplace you dont know people you dont know

9210375 m nchengladbach hat sehr gut gespielt aber wenn das spiel f nf minuten l nger gedauert h tte w re es eng geworden f r gladbach
9210376 sie sind sehr motiviert in die saison gestartet haben mit zwei siegen das notwendige selbstvertrauen geholt aber heute hat man gesehen wenn sie gegen gute mannschaften wie gegen leverkusen spielen dass dann limits zum tragen kommen aber das ist v llig normal das ist die j ngste mannschaft der liga sie kommen fulminant aus der vierten f nften liga es war klar dass hoffenheim in diesem jahr nicht deutscher meister wird und ich glaube dass haben sie sp testens heute verstanden
9210377 es war eine gro artige herausforderung heute gegen werder bremen zu spielen und auch noch zu gewinnen ich muss meiner mannschaft ein riesen kompliment machen
9210378 wir haben sehr gut trainiert die woche und haben uns gut vorbereitet es hat eigentlich alles gepasst nur das was heute hier abgeboten wurde das passte nicht
9210379 jetzt am ende ist es egal wir haben die niederlage und wir m ssen damit leben aber das bedeutet f r die n chsten 14 tage wir m ssen sehr viel gas geben
9210380 bisher kann ich nur sagen ich habe die richtige entscheidung gemacht ich freu mich riesig dar ber wir haben einen fantastischen start hingelegt und dass ich dabei helfen konnte ist super f r mich
9210381 die erste halbzeit war irgendwie h lle 2 0 zur ckgelegen und wirklich zwei dumme tore bekommen von einer starken bielefelder mannschaft aber wir haben weiter gek mpft und an uns geglaubt
9210382 es war ein verr cktes spiel wir lagen 2 0 zur ck aber haben charakter gezeigt
9210383 ich denke es war ein unterhaltsames spiel aber ein spiel das wir h tten gewinnen m ssen das erste tor war ein halbes eigentor und beim zweiten haben wir lange darum gebettelt endlich ein gegentor zu bekommen
9210384 man sieht was f r eine qualit t wolfsburg hat und dass wir hier mit einem punkt nach hause fahren ist gut f r die moral so m ssen wir weitermachen
9210385 die mannschaft hat sich nie aufgegeben hat das fortgesetzt was wir in k ln in der letzten halben stunde gezeigt haben und deswegen bin ich auch mit dem spiel und mit dem ergebnis zufrieden
9210386 was mich ge rgert hat waren die letzten zehn minuten da haben wir uns h ngen lassen nach dem motto jetzt ist alles egal

9210388 as companies increasingly view travel as an investment in their business we are helping our clients adjust to manage their travel programs in a disciplined way by incorporating best practices and optimizing policy guidelines and compliance strategies these efforts are designed to maximize spending efficiency and increase the return on investment
9210389 during times when economic conditions are volatile companies step up efforts to stress the importance of purchasing tickets in advance in order to use discount tickets in a negotiated travel program
9210390 our data shows that during the second quarter of 2008 89 percent of tickets purchased were domestic discount coach fares this shows that more travelers purchased tickets in advance these subtle changes can translate into significant savings 17 percent or more in some cases looking at the first six months of 2008 the companies that had travelers purchase 8 14 days in advance rather than 0 7 days in advance saved an average of 49 per segment
9210391 as globalization continues to pull business travelers to international destinations we advise our clients to focus on international travel policy compliance
9210392 strategies including encouraging employees to take advantage of corporate discounts negotiated with preferred suppliers and trading down to lower classes of service when appropriate are driving savings for our clients despite the difficult travel market our recommended best practices also include using tools like the pre trip auditor to ensure greater compliance

9210429 the establishment is uneasy over the prospects of mr zardari taking over as the president they are sure that in case of a fair contest mr zardari will go through they want to stop him by any means
9210430 the concentration of power in one hand would be a rerun of musharraf s dictatorship with the 17th amendment in place and an obedient prime minister
9210431 mr zardari s penchant for dismissing signed deals as not sacrosanct or hadith or quran religious scriptures have left many wondering if his credibility can ever be restored

9210435 the flurry of activity of the nato naval forces which continue building up their grouping in the black sea arouses suspicion
9210436 moreover we have learned that eight more nato warships are to arrive shortly
9210437 what is the purpose of all this references are being made to scheduled exercises and indeed one can see some legitimacy in this
9210438 but these eight warships expected to arrive in the black sea will carry cargoes of a different kind not humanitarian aid
9210439 its very hard to believe that all other arrivals of nato warships at georgian ports were for humanitarian aid purposes only as declared

9210483 i cant understand why anyone would do this to someone in my situation why would they want to make it worse for me

9210513 i have been waiting on you welcome home i cant wait to show you around
9210514 we had already spent hundreds of pounds buying wine and expensive sparkling water so i was gobsmacked when the waiter refused to bring us a jug of tap water or even a glass he told us it wasnt the restaurants policy to serve tap water
9210515 i asked to speak to the manager and explained that we had bought plenty of drinks and wanted some normal water one member of the party needed to take medication and we did not consider asking for a jug of water unreasonable he flatly refused to let us have any reiterating that it was not the restaurants policy
9210516 water costs us the ice costs us the lemon costs us i have to charge
9210517 when i was in burger king recently i started coughing and asked for some tap water they refused even though i had tears running down my cheeks as i struggled to stop coughing they did offer to sell me a bottle of water however i decided to buy a coke instead as that was cheaper apparently they dont do tap water
9210518 as a country we have put 70bn into the water industry tap water in britain is now of the very highest quality and we urge restaurants to offer tap water to customers for free you shouldnt have to feel like a cheapskate because you ask for tap water
9210519 as a retired hotelier and restaurateur i was always led to believe that by law an innkeeper cannot refuse a traveller free water even if they do not spend any money at the establishment
9210520 there are a lot of misconceptions some of which arose out of the leah betts case in the wake of her death a lot of large premises had clauses put into their licensing agreements which obliged them to offer tap water free of charge
9210521 but apart from that restriction restaurants do not have to give you water and do not have to supply it for free
9210522 if a restaurant is on the public mains supply the water is potable and there is no reason for it not to be supplied on health and safety grounds
9210523 strada is pleased to provide tap water free of charge throughout its restaurants as part of standard service
9210524 t he vision of mind that has captured the imagination of philosophers cognitive scientists economists and political scientists since the eighteenth century a dispassionate mind that makes decisions by weighing the evidence and reasoning to the most valid conclusions bears no relation to how the mind and brain actually work

9210527 hay un drama real en t bet durante estos juegos ol mpicos y tiene muy poco que ver con los esp ritus budistas voladores de la ceremonia de apertura o la propaganda oper stica de la ceremonia de clausura los l deres chinos deben ir pasar del talento para el espect culo al talento de estado y ver la manera en que el pueblo tibetano encuentre soluciones reales a los problemas reales en t bet
9210528 las olimi adas no s lo han fracasado en servir como un catalizador de la liberalizaci n pol tica en china sino que el despliegue de seguridad anterior a los juegos parece haberse establecido para que el gobierno pueda recurrir a la represi n contra la disidencia con mayor fuerza a n una vez que terminen las olimpiadas la creciente inestabilidad en varios frentes ha predispuesto al liderazgo hu a fortalecer el aparato estatal policiaco que se ha armado en nombre de asegurar unas olimpiadas libres de problemas lo que es m s los cuadros encargados de establecer la ley y el orden los cuales incluyen a oficiales de alto rango en la comisi n central pol tica y legal as como a las dependencias militares polic acas y judiciales han ganado un poder inmenso sin mencionar muchos m s fondos desde principios de este a o

9210536 but please do try to keep a grip on yourself
9210537 all right all right will you be quiet and let me get on with it hes a terrible old gasbag
9210538 youd arrive at your destination before youd left your starting point
9210539 you do good perhaps you can explain it to me sometime when you have a spare moment
9210540 yes pow pow is a technical expression professor meaning that all the microcircuitry will fuse into one ngyuh of molten metal

9210542 you know what they say about hyperspace its a theoretical absurdity ive always wanted to be lost in one of those
9210543 there is an error in the circuitry you are not to blame
9210544 to see the law is in such capable er hands we must be going now
9210545 four months of turmoil have followed in which almost every move by palin has been questioned
9210546 john mccain is to be commended on his choice of sarah palin a true christian for vice president
9210547 palin an evangelical who is pro life and pro marriage meets all the criterion that cadc set forth for a vp pick unfortunately obama chose joe biden a liberal catholic who is not in compliance with christian moral teaching on abortion or homosexuality
9210548 will mccain pick a pro choice republican or perhaps a moderate mormon or a liberal jew
9210549 unless mccain picks a true christian for vice president real conservative christians are being disenfranchised from this presidential election
9210550 obama missed a great chance to reach out to christians now we will see if mccain will let conservative christians have someone we can vote for not just vote against
9210551 between an avowed pro abortion ticket that would continue to push for unrestricted abortion on demand and a strongly pro life ticket that will bring us closer to a society that embraces the value and dignity of human life
9210552 healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both
9210553 we wondered how her using a city computer to run for lieutenant governor in 2002 was different than republican party chief randy ruedrich using alaska oil and gas conservation commission computers for party business for which he was fined and resigned under pressure she said it was different
9210554 in a release palin fired off to everyone she could think of after the questions she huffed about a smear campaign organized by her enemies powerful enemies later there were references on various radio talk shows to whispering campaigns and other craziness but we wrote that off as the vapors and a touch of paranoia
9210555 she characterized as innocuous her political e mails sent on a city computer to the alaska outdoor council and another complaining about the right to life folks not choosing her as their candidate in the 2002 race
9210556 that was bad enough indicating she just does not get it but then she had this to say weve had lots of people come forward with dirt on gubernatorial candidate john binkley as well as dirt on gov frank murkowski weve told them to bury it im not running that type of campaign
9210557 apparently that is exactly the kind of vicious campaign the former two term wasilla mayor is running in our view that kind of backdoor character assassination is the most scurrilous type of attack
9210558 oh i have dirt palin says smugly yes indeedy but ill not give the details because that would be wrong she is right it is very wrong it is very much the hallmark of lightweight politicians in over their heads
9210559 the next day in her garage she found a tote full of memories
9210560 i have lost a lot but i am so grateful to have that handful of pictures
9210561 w re obama wei und hie e zum beispiel jack miller w rde er bei dieser ausgangslage mit an sicherheit angrenzender wahrscheinlichkeit die wahl gewinnen
9210562 in umfragen sagen lediglich vier bis f nf prozent der amerikaner dass sie nicht f r einen schwarzen kandidaten stimmen w rden die eigentliche zahl aber d rfte h her liegen
9210563 genau an dieser stelle kommt es auf einen der zentralen begriffe aus obamas wahlkampagne an auf

9210566 wir lassen uns weder von schikanen durch cdu spd und co noch von linksextremen gewaltt tern unser recht auf meinungsfreiheit streitig machen wir verteidigen statt dessen elementare demokratische grundrechte gegen einen regelrechten stra enterror im namen einer verlogenen politcal correctness eingeworfene fensterscheiben im pro k ln fraktionsb ro ein bewu tlos geschlagener pro k ln stadtrat vor einer woche und nun dieser erneute brutale berfall mit zwei verletzten pro nrw spitzenfunktion ren als folge wollen etwa k chler und co zusehen wie auf diese weise ihr unliebsamer mitbewerber um das oberb rgermeisteramt j rg uckermann zum verzicht auf seine kandidatur gepr gelt werden soll ich frage ganz im ernst und ohne jene polemik jeden pressevertreter jeden politiker und alle b rger leverkusens und des rheinlandes sind wir wirklich noch so weit entfernt von den zust nden in wei ru land simbabwe oder china hier wie dort werden unliebsame oppositionspolitiker zusammengeschlagen b ros von oppositionellen angegriffen und besch digt versammlungsr ume gek ndigt oder beh rdliche schikanen angeordnet ist das der weg den wir hier in deutschland wirklich einschlagen wollen soll es zum standart in der politischen auseinandersetzung werden da sich die mehrheitsvertreter von cdu spd fdp und gr nen ausdr cklich gegen eine resolution zum gewaltverzicht in der politik aussprechen wie erst vorgestern in der k lner ratssitzung geschehen jetzt ist der zeitpunkt da wo jeder ehrlich berzeugte demokrat einspruch anmelden m te auch wenn es sich um eine ungeliebte politisch nicht korrekte konkurrenz handelt und ich sage auch ganz klar ich erwarte an dieser stelle endlich einmal klare und mahnende worte der evangelischen und katholischen kirchenvertreter die zu solchen berf llen bisher eisern geschwiegen und sich im gegenteil mancherorts sogar noch an primitiven hetzkampagnen gegen angesehene christliche pro k ln und pro nrw mitglieder beteiligt haben hier g be es eine einmalige gelegenheit christliche charakterst rke und echte zivilcourage zu zeigen gegen den strom des zeitgeistes zu schwimmen und politische minderheiten in schutz zu nehmen es wird sich ja zeigen wieviel politischer anstand bei den m chtigen in unserem land noch vorhanden ist dessen ungeachtet gehen wir unseren weg weiter wohl wissend da wir in vielen fragen die mehrheitsmeinung der einheimischen bev lkerung vertreten und in der gewi heit da es in ganz nrw ein w hlerpotential von bis zu 20 prozent f r einen seri sen rechtsdemokratischen politikansatz gibt diesem teil der bev lkerung werden wir eine kr ftige stimme verleihen sowohl in leverkusen als auch in k ln und ganz nrw
9210567 i think the enthusiasm here and bringing all these people together is very powerful
9210568 this is a big show because it is the last one that we know of for a while
9210569 i think its wonderful theyre all here i really do
9210570 we stop and yell at them all the time have a good time
9210571 the money they bring into the whole area is terrific
9210572 we still have to clean up some of our unforced errors that will be key for us through the rest of the season
9210573 we need to make teams earn their points and not give them free points

9210914 even with the loss of almost 10 000 acres of prairie dogs conata basin still remains the largest and most important prairie dog complex on federal lands in the great plains its worth all these efforts to save it
9210915 theres the plague and the prairie dogs and thats nature taking care of the expansion
9210916 i think we want to get along we want to be able to survive just the same as the prairie dogs want to survive we dont want to annihilate them we dont just get them under control so theyre not sick give the ferrets something healthy to eat

9210940 was a brigader in 1996 as was her husband chris they were at a fundraiser for me shes a terrific gal shes a rebel reformer
9210941 governor palin has never worked for any effort to elect pat buchanan that assertion is completely false as mayor of wasilla sarah palin did attend an event with mr buchanan in her home town where reports described her wearing a buchanan for president button she wore the button as a courtesy to mr buchanan and in an effort to make him feel welcome during his visit but immediately sent a letter to the editor of her local paper clarifying that the button should not have been interpreted as an endorsement of any kind
9210942 john mccains decision to select a vice presidential running mate that endorsed pat buchanan for president in 2000 is a direct affront to all jewish americans pat buchanan is a nazi sympathizer with a uniquely atrocious record on israel even going as far as to denounce bringing former nazi soldiers to justice and praising adolf hitler for his great courage at a time when standing up for israels right to self defense has never been more critical john mccain has failed his first test of leadership and judgment by selecting a running mate who has aligned herself with a leading anti israel voice in american politics it is frightening that john mccain would select someone one heartbeat away from the presidency who supported a man who embodies vitriolic anti israel sentiments

9210952 were quite keen to explore another potential motive whether it was linked to some chinese organised crime groups targeting foreign students or young people in the uk

9210959 the concept for the heart of the master is based on the pamphlet of the same name written by aleister crowley under the pseudonym khaled khan and originally published by the o t o in 1938 designed to be simultaneously a logical progression and step away from the ideas explored on previous full length mourner the single 14 minute track unfashioned realms combines desolate widescreen cinematic textures pulsating black metal and twisted programmed beats held together by ca nas signature eerie ambience
9210960 in her cover version of the kinks melancholy anthem days u
9210961 recorded live at the north shore surf club in olympia washington on may 16 1991
9210962 she seems like a compelling person with a terrific personal story im sure that she will help make the case for republicans
9210963 unfortunately the case is more of the same and so ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket
9210964 he wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming gov palin agrees with him and his policies but the fact that she will soon be nominated is one more indicator of this country moving forward one more hit against that glass ceiling i congratulate her and look forward to a vigorous debate
9210965 2 implementing a windfall profits tax on the oil companies
9210966 shame on her for not staying home and raising her baby
9210967 can you picture a sarah palin in the oval office
9210968 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9210969 and i feel bad bo got the short end of the stick where family is concerned but what about college buddies co workers from law firm no testimonials from anyone but michelle
9210970 is mccain even running his own campaign he only met her for the first time 6 months ago
9210971 well see in the coming weeks what she has to offer
9210972 obamas time in u s senate equals 143 days before that community organizer who got asbestos removed from a building
9210973 republicans have said they are secretly voting independent or for obama
9210974 while obama talks about cleaning up politics sarah has actually done it
9210975 by the end of this campaign she too will be a celebrity
9210976 but question if it were your decision and you were putting your country first would you put an untested small town mayor a heartbeat away from the presidency
9210977 does she gov palin have the skill set to construct a campaign that would actually have brought her to the nomination herself
9210978 yes obama is inexperienced in foreign policy but at least he has thought seriously about it
9210979 think about what the obama pick really says about how obama supporters views this campaign and how they views obamas potential responsibilities in national security
9210980 i wished i could have bombed more etc etc etc the list of anti american leftist radicals who are friends of obama goes on and on
9210981 this is a historical choice the first black nominated for president
9210982 shes going to learn national security at the foot of the master for the next four years and most doctors think that hell be around at least that long
9210983 judge people by the content of their character not the color of their skin
9210984 the bush administration is already implementing policies that obama has called for
9210985 think about what the palin pick really says about how mccain views this campaign and how he views his potential responsibilities in national security
9210986 anybody who doesnt recognize what has changed in bushs foreing policy in the last 6 months is living in a fantasyworld
9210987 willem omg are you actually suggesting that the us government is following obamas orders

9211152 the last week has been all about demonstrating a couple of things
9211153 first that the liberal national parties are utterly united and capable of working together on a complex issue like this also that the coalition is in strong shape able to make a decision and stick with it that hasnt always been the case it is an important message to send to the electorate
9211154 the business community is but one of the factors the liberal party needs to take into account when it makes decisions

9211168 the trick to being a politician in a representative democracy is to get the people to believe that you represent them while making them really represent
9211169 we are governed our minds are molded our tastes formed our ideas suggested largely by men we have never heard of we are dominated by a relatively small number of persons who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses it is they who pull the wires which control the public the conscious manipulation of organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in a democratic society those who manipulate this unseen mechanism constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power in this country
9211170 in new mexico theyre such a big part of the election our entire program is built around the hispanic vote

9211173 we will have a bigger program spanish language media program than in 2004 and i think folks will respond to the message that were putting out there

9211202 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9211203 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9211204 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9211205 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9211206 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9211207 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9211208 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9211209 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9211210 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9211211 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9211212 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9211213 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9211214 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9211215 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9211216 who are open to doing something on the production side
9211217 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9211218 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9211219 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9211220 knowing the difference between what you have a right to do and what is the right thing to do
9211221 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9211222 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9211223 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9211224 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9211225 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9211226 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9211227 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9211228 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9211229 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9211230 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9211231 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9211232 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9211233 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9211234 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9211235 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9211236 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9211237 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9211238 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9211239 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9211240 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9211241 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9211242 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9211243 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9211244 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9211245 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9211246 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9211247 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

9211249 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9211250 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9211251 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9211252 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9211253 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9211254 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9211255 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9211256 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

9211259 the task force came up with this training plan with the help of the special forces
9211260 battle space in this area is very constrictive so we thought it would be safer and easier for soldiers to fast rope in instead of having helicopters land
9211261 we were asked to help with the training due to some of our guys being qualified fast ropers and fries masters
9211262 since they special forces were using our helicopters the squadron wanted to incorporate us into the training
9211263 its important that you grab the rope and not try to jump to it
9211264 if you miss the rope youll fall and could possibly die its also important that you rotate in the proper direction when grabbing the rope if you turn into your buddy you could knock him off the rope and he could fall and die
9211265 it gives us a higher level of mobility we can get in and out of places people cant normally get to
9211266 it is important for tottenham not to lose another game they want their first three points in the league so we have some problems we know this tottenham have lost both games and made some mistakes but this is a big chance for tottenham because it is a derby we need to respect them even more
9211267 we need to start getting points on the board and i think having a game like chelsea at this time gives us a great chance to lift the spirits the game plan should be to go there and play with an ambitious attacking style of football without fear the team that takes its chances on the day will be the one who prevails
9211268 robinho is staying in madrid and there is no possibility of going back on that

9211290 we did not take lightly the fact we recommended a strike
9211291 this is not just talking about 27 000 members this is talking about 27 000 members and their families
9211292 we are more than willing to talk to the union and discuss the contract with them in more detail that said this is truly our final offer
9211293 were extremely disappointed that the union is recommending that our employees reject what adds up to the best contract in the aerospace industry
9211294 we hope our employees recognize the value of this offer
9211295 we encourage them to study it calculate what it means to them and their families and vote in their best interests on sept 3 this is our best and final offer and thats what it means

9211305 we needed a go round so we could talk to each other in the privacy of our own homes so we bridged the gap to the twenty first century by going back
9211306 the most difficult part of forming a chaordic organization is to understand and get beyond the origin and nature of our current concepts of organizations to set them aside in order to make space for new and different thoughts every mind is a room filled with archaic furniture it must be moved about or cleared away before anything new can enter this means ruthless confrontation of the many things we know that are no longer so

9211316 were continuing with our fundraising and things have been going well for us
9211317 the question in my mind is who is behind this and where did the considerable amount of money necessary come from
9211318 and you watched lots of people get shipped off to the death camps
9211319 right i was 14 years old and i would say that thats when my character was made
9211320 that one should think ahead one should understand that and anticipate events and when when one is threatened it was a tremendous threat of evil i mean it was a a very personal threat of evil
9211321 my understanding is that you went went out in fact and helped in the confiscation of property from the jews
9211322 i mean sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many many years was it difficult
9211323 not not at all not at all maybe as a child you dont you dont see the connection but it was it created no no problem at all
9211324 for example that im jewish and here i am watching these people go i could just as easily be these i should be there none of that
9211325 well of course i could be on the other side or i could be the one from whom the thing is being taken away but there was no sense that i shouldnt be there because that was well actually in a funny way its just like in the markets that is i werent there of course i wasnt doing it but somebody else would would would be taking it away anyhow and it was the whether i was there or not i was only a spectator the property was being taken away so the i had no role in taking away that property so i had no sense of guilt

9211330 we still feel that were right and the evidence will come out that obama is not eligible to be president weve been fielding so much information and getting so many telephone calls weve had millions of hits on our web site weve received phone calls and e mails from lawyers immigration officials and we do feel as though things are going to break open
9211331 we are receiving many emails asking what happens if in fact senator obama is forced to step down or is removed as the democratic nominee for this reason we have posted the democratic national comittees 2008 call rules and

9211754 ive developed a repeatable procedure for test firing bullets to determine ballistic coefficient if you get the march issue has one of my articles about test firing the berger 30 cal 155gr vld long story short my test procedure uses acoustic sensors in 200 yard increments to measure time of flight out to 600 or 1000 yards my bc measurements are repeatable to within 2 usually within 1 i have tested several 7mm bullets of particular interest are the berger 180gr and jlk 180gr bullets if you look at these bullets side by side its hard to tell a difference between them i believe the jlk bullet dies were made from the same set of prints as the berger vld design by bill davis of tioga engineering so why would these bullets have different published bcs theyre the same weight and the same basic shape with very minor differences in oal and bearing surface length this is just the kind of smoke and mirrors that makes shooters think there is something mysterious about bcs and exterior ballistics thats beyond the realm of human understanding i was pleased with the results of my testing of these two bullets the bc is virtually the same as expected all is right with the world
9211755 part of the reason there is so much slop in advertised bcs is because theyre referenced to the g1 standard which is very speed sensitive the g7 standard is more appropriate for long range bullets here are the results of my testing for these two bullets g1 bcs averaged between 1500 fps and 3000 fps berger 180 vld 0 659 lb in jlk 180 0 645 lb in the reason the bc for the jlk is less is mostly because the meplat was significantly larger on the particular lot that i tested 0 075 vs 0 059 see attached drawings for bullets like these its much better to use the g7 standard the following bcs are referenced to the g7 standard and are constant for all speeds g7 bcs berger 180 vld 0 337 lb in jlk 180 0 330 lb in many modern ballistics programs including the free online jbm ballistics program are able to use bcs referenced to g7 standards when available these bcs are more appropriate for long range bullets

9211761 it sucks son youll have responsibilities sometimes you get your heart broken youll realise people arnt perfect and the only reason you keep going is so you hope to earn enough to provide for the people you love
9211762 the day the child realised that all adults are imperfect he becomes an adolescent the day he forgives them he becomes and adult and the day he forgives himself he becomes wise

9211765 i would be very interested to see the evidence the bbc has to justify his atholls claim that bbc online local news video will enhance the local and regional news coverage of its rivals
9211766 the trouble is that the beeb wants to have a finger in every pie this can only mean there is less pie to share among the commercial operators who without the privilege of the television licence fee have to earn their revenues based on audience reach
9211767 when we talk to our audiences they tell us loud and clear that they want better regional news from around scotland we have always been in the video business
9211768 the crucial market is the youth market those that have turned away from newspapers i fail to see how a new bbc online service will engage people to buy newspapers and it is through newspapers that local regional publishers continue to make most of their money
9211769 it remains to be seen what effect they will have i can only speak for our paper but we have a very loyal readership and when they are searching for news about the borders they will turn to us
9211770 regional titles are the best placed to get through this
9211771 we could still say no to the whole thing the trust has a strong track record in requesting alterations or amendments to such plans

9211891 i am going to make an offer to the government and the united nations to participate in a joint investigation with the coalition to continue to look at the facts surrounding these allegations and to make sure that we have come as close as we can to everybody knowing the truth of what happened in azizabad

9211951 this endeavour has been a huge success far more significant and wide reaching than anyone ever dreamt it could be it has had obvious beneficial effects on the palestinian people but also on israel in fairness credit must go where credit is due despite threats or obstacles a responsible decision was made by israeli authorities not to interfere with our mission and this is a model for the future
9211952 the landing of two wooden boats carrying 46 human rights activists in gaza is an important symbolic victory this non violent initiative of the free gaza movement focused attention around the world on the stark reality that the 1 5 million residents of gaza have endured a punitive siege for more than a year this siege is a form of collective punishment that constitutes a massive violation of article 33 of the fourth geneva convention the siege the coastal blockade and overflights by israeli aircraft all bear witness to the fact that despite israels claimed disengagement in 2005 these realities on the ground establish that gaza remains under israeli occupation and as a result israel remains legally responsible for protecting the human rights of its civilian population by severely restricting the entry of food fuel and medicine the economic and social rights of the people of gaza have been systematically violated there is widespread deafness among the people of gaza that is blamed on the frequent sonic booms produced by over flying israeli military aircraft for this reason the peace boats brought 200 hearing aids to gaza
9211953 above all what is being tested is whether the imaginative engagement of dedicated private citizens can influence the struggle of a beleaguered people for basic human rights and whether their courage and commitment can awaken the conscience of humanity to an unfolding tragedy
9211954 there have been plenty of highs and lows in my career and its been an honour to wear the springbok jersey but it is time to go
9211955 with the new laws and a new era in front of us with the way rugby is played and with a new coach peter de villiers it is the right time
9211956 i have had many memorable moments in a springbok jersey and it has been a privilege to play for my country and to go around the world playing against so many great players of other countries

9212015 we must stress that the foster family still remain unaccounted for
9212016 hoy la mano no me ha causado problemas insuperables aunque tambi n he tratado no forzarla demasiado hay fragmentos de hueso que en algunos momentos tocan los nervios y entonces siento unos pinchazos que me recorren todo el brazo en cualquier caso es algo que tengo que administrar en el momento esta ma ana afinamos la puesta a punto muy bien luego por la tarde la temperatura subi a n m s y hemos tenido que tomar un camino ligeramente diferente que por suerte ha funcionado muy bien hemos trabajado tanto en los reglajes de carrera que al final nos ha quedado tiempo s lo para dos gomas de calificaci n con la primera tambi n montamos un delantero nuevo que ha necesitado dos vueltas para trabajar bien mientras que la segunda fue v lida pero no exactamente como la primera en cualquier caso al final ha ido bien y estoy contento con esta nueva pole ma ana ser una carrera muy muy larga pero estoy deseando que llegue el momento
9212017 el tiempo es fant stico pero pienso que quiz es mejor ir a la playa que al circuito estamos en el sitio equivocado pero despu s de lo ocurrido en las ltimas carreras prefiero esto que la lluvia estoy muy contento con nuestro trabajo porque se ha trabajado muy bien con los neum ticos de calificaci n y hemos podido mejorar cada vez era muy importante no hemos podido coger a stoner pero salir segundo es una buena posici n para la carrera nuestra puesta a punto no es la ideal todav a porque hay algunas curvas en las que no encontramos la velocidad necesaria hay que ponerse manos a la obra para solucionarlo esta noche tenemos muchos datos de estos dos d as as que intentaremos sacar algo en claro en el warm up de ma ana a primera hora es toy convencido de que podemos mejorar en el setting un poquito m s
9212018 desde ayer por la ma ana estaba claro que la pista era distinta para nosotros hemos sufrido mucho menos y los neum ticos michelin son m s competitivos por ello se lo quiero agradecer desde aqu he podido pilotar bien cogiendo un buen ritmo una vez m s he recuperado la confianza que necesitaba para ir r pido estoy muy feliz por volver otra vez a la primera l nea est muy claro que ser complicado estar al lado de stoner y valentino los dos est n muy fuertes pero para nosotros lo m s importante es poder competir con ellos en una buena posici n desde el inicio todav a no pienso en el resultado pero ser mucho mejor intentar coger un buen ritmo y probar de realizar una gran carrera para todos los aficionados q ue llenar n misano
9212019 estoy bastante contento ya que hemos mejorado mis tiempos por vuelta y ma ana arrancar desde segunda fila en la misma posici n que el a o pasado ser importante hacer una buena salida ya que la primera curva est muy cerca de la parrilla he mejorado mi ritmo y eso es realmente importante ya que estoy volviendo a ir r pido hoy hemos trabajado mucho en las suspensiones la nueva horquilla me da sensaciones positivas ya que es m s suave en las frenadas estoy muy motivado aunque todav a necesito alg n tiempo para estar de nuevo arriba en plenas condiciones
9212020 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9212021 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9212022 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9212023 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9212024 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9212025 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9212026 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9212027 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9212028 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9212029 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9212030 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9212031 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9212032 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9212033 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9212034 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9212035 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9212036 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9212037 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9212038 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9212039 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9212040 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9212041 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9212042 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9212043 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9212044 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9212045 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9212046 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9212047 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9212048 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9212049 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9212050 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9212051 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9212052 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9212053 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9212054 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9212055 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
9212056 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
9212057 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9212058 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9212059 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9212060 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9212061 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9212062 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9212063 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9212064 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9212065 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9212066 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9212067 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9212068 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9212069 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9212070 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9212071 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9212072 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9212073 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9212074 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9212075 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9212076 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9212077 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9212078 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9212079 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9212080 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9212081 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9212082 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9212083 no one works for someone we all just work together
9212084 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9212085 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
9212086 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
9212087 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
9212088 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
9212089 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9212090 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9212091 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9212092 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9212093 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9212094 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9212095 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9212096 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9212097 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9212098 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9212099 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9212100 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9212101 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9212102 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9212103 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9212104 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9212105 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9212106 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9212107 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9212108 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9212109 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9212110 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9212111 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9212112 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9212113 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9212114 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9212115 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9212116 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9212117 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9212118 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9212119 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9212120 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9212121 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9212122 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9212123 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9212124 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9212125 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9212126 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9212127 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9212128 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9212129 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9212130 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9212131 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9212132 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9212133 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9212134 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
9212135 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
9212136 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
9212137 gov sarah palin vetoed a bill thursday that sought to block the state from giving public employee benefits such as health insurance to same sex couples
9212138 it is the governors intention to work with the legislature and to give the people of alaska an opportunity to express their wishes and intentions whether these benefits should continue
9212139 im not so sure youd want to see me eat it might not make a great first impression
9212140 carrie needs someone who is going to stick by her
9212141 weve accomplished our initial goal the hard part now begins
9212142 were not going to be satisfied with just being the no 1 in the elims well strive to win the championship
9212143 thats a bearing game for them and not for us but well be there playing with a lot of pride
9212144 theres really the tendency for this team to be complacent when up against a lowly rival we cant afford this when were already in the final four
9212145 i was 18 when i fought in seoul as a flyweight in 1988
9212146 then i moved to bantamweight in barcelona four years later when i was 21 its hard to stay in ta amors division for two olympics because your body matures as you get older
9212147 we only had one boxing qualifier in beijing and this was how he was treated
9212148 you would think that since we only had one boxer he would be cared for besides he was a legitimate medal contender
9212149 were still undecided but we might go for talent than height actually we need a big man but what the draft roster offers is a deep pool of talented guards
9212150 the biggest significance of this deal is that cnpc will benefit as the first international oil company to be developing one of the giant discovered oil fields in iraq in the new era
9212151 they will be the first with people on the ground and the first to develop a working relationship with iraqs oil ministry

9212177 its a good way to kick off our fall and i want to thank all of the volunteers who help make this happen
9212178 i just had the furniture delivered yesterday but this really starts out with boxer from the first moment he was fun and easy to work with boxer was unlike any salesperson i have ever had he was not pushy he did not force stuff on me i didnt need he got me to what i was looking for and needed and i needed a lot
9212179 boxer walked me through and took his time and was attentive i was 110 pleased with the service at gallery furniture because of folks like boxer i got a lovely traditional bedroom set that has built in lighting some gorgeous cocktail and two end table sets that have a combination of wrought iron wood and marble and a huge entertainment center that has plenty of storage room for my dvd collection and large television boxer walked me through every part of sale and was very polite
9212180 i will admit i am the worlds biggest procrastinator when the team showed up i was absolutely not ready nowhere near ready my husband was not home i did not have it ready to move in i told henry to leave everything on the outdoor patio and that my husband and i would have to handle it later
9212181 henry told me point blank maam you have bought the cadillac of furniture some of these pieces weigh two hundred pounds each easy you could hurt yourself moving it and i dont want your furniture getting ruined if it sits outside or overnight this is great furniture i really wanted to wait for my husband for his help in placing the furniture and i let henry know how important that was at that point henry gave me his cell number and told me maam you just call when your husband gets here well get all of this exactly where you want it this blew me away again henry and his assistant a young man whose name i forgot but he was working his behind off got everything together and told me they would return you know and mattress mack wants to know this any other furniture actually every other furniture stores delivery people in houston would just look at you and go oh okay yeah sure well leave it on the patio bye and go running out the door not gallery furniture not henry i called henry back and at 8 00 p m they were in my home and gallery furniture had my whole house finished by 10 30 p m and i want to stress no other furniture store would have done that no one only gallery furniture your commitment to customer service is well its something else you guys went above and beyond in so many ways
9212182 i am sad to say i went to the roomstore before for a reclining sofa and love seat group and got some very bad service from them my sales woman for some reason talked me and my husband out of delivery claiming it would save us 100 if we just went over to the warehouse and picked it up she knew we had a truck and said it was no big deal and we could handle it so we left the roomstore in katy to their warehouse which was another 10 miles out of the way and the roomstore warehouse loaded the truck we get home and it was there that we realized just how heavy these pieces were the sofa felt like a thousand pounds i have neck and back problems and the roomstore girl told me it would be no big deal and easy to get in my living room when i was done i was literally in tears looking back i realized that i never haggled for price never said i was looking for a bargain or deal she just assumed i wanted a hundred dollars off i guess and convinced me not to take the roomstores supposed same day delivery offer so when i got to gallery furniture and spoke with boxer i was very specific i said i wanted these items all delivered whatever it took and thats exactly what gallery furniture did
9212183 you know i remember that a while back boxer helped my daughter select her furniture and that whole experience was out of this world too as a matter of fact i had ordered a table that time and as the delivery team was bringing it in they accidentally broke a leg they set the rest of the furniture in place and told me maam dont worry we will replace this today we promise and gallery furniture kept good on their promise here i was worried that i would have a damaged table for two weeks but the gallery furniture guys were back within hours and all was well
9212184 hes got all my money for the rest of my life let me tell ya
9212185 at the company i work for we have a slogan that says we sell customer service we throw our product in for free thats what i feel mattress mack and gallery furniture do i am not buying furniture i am buying great customer service

9212389 he told each of the governors that federal officials were monitoring hurricane gustav very closely
9212390 president bush pledged the full support of the federal government
9212391 prices are more affected down south while new york is supplied through new york harbor
9212392 i think some of those areas are going to get hit hard again and its really going to squeeze people
9212393 we are seeing gas price increases here that are based on the possibility that there may be some supply dislocation
9212394 that would affect supply close to the affected area as opposed to anywhere else
9212395 this makes gustav an extremely dangerous category 4 hurricane on the saffir simpson hurricane scale
9212396 i am strongly strongly encouraging everyone in this city to evacuate
9212397 i am confident and positive that the city will arrange a good place
9212398 my last 24 hours have been somewhat worrisome and very very prayerful because this is a very serious threat and its a lot of people to get to safe ground or be safe where they are
9212399 im very worried that the city is going to get hit again and i dont want to be here when that happens
9212400 i think its great that they are on top of the game early this time
9212401 i think a lot more people will be satisfied this time than last time
9212402 its frustrating to see that they dont listen but its good seeing that they are coming
9212403 he was one of the nicest most down to earth guys i have ever met
9212404 just going to put it out there i have had no contact with my father
9212405 i hope he uses this time to keep mourn the loss of his father rather than taking the time to talk to the media about me or anyone in my life
9212406 hes out of control i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media about the people i love
9212407 on another note im having fun on the set of ugly betty the cast is great the crew is great and its nice to be at work doing what i love to do
9212408 our plan is still of course to retire the shuttle in 2010
9212409 where does the money come from where do the people who should be working on the moon rocket where do they come from we started shutting down the shuttle four years ago that horse has left the barn
9212410 locals in the county rushed out into the open and cracks appeared on house walls and many windows were broken
9212411 unless we apply the full force of the law in such cases we are never really going to achieve anything
9212412 certainly for these sorts of cases well have to apply the maximum regardless of your past and regardless of your race as well
9212413 this was a very serious case of rape and murder
9212414 you inflicted what must have been a painful and very frightening death upon your victim
9212415 you are a brutal bully with no respect for women no control over your jealousy and no respect for the orders of the court
9212416 there is evidence to say that the levels of violence and the nature of the violence is far more severe when it involves indigenous males against indigenous females
9212417 the victim is often seeking help and the system is not vigilant enough
9212418 the system and the community needs to put more effort into preventing these murders and this extreme offences of violence from occurring in the first place
9212419 but to achieve some longer term gain which would be a reduction in this sort of violence and a change in aboriginal mens attitude towards women that may be the short term cost
9212420 if the evidence is there then the matter would proceed as a murder trial this idea that some sort of sympathy for the accused comes into that those deliberations is just not right
9212421 quite often the other witnesses to the incident are also affected by alcohol and often we havent got the sort of evidence that we would like to prove that the person intended to cause death or to cause serious injury
9212422 the criminal courts of the northern territory are replete with examples of shocking violence inflicted upon aboriginal women in remote communities
9212423 the present day gross violence perpetrated on some women in such communities by some men must be recognised and something done about it
9212424 they live far away from the protections and resources available to women living in most of the towns and cities of australia
9212425 the government and its agencies must endeavour to protect such women

9212445 even though many of us think of labor day weekend as the end of summer mosquitoes will be around until a hard frost
9212446 we are still seeing a lot of virus around in every part of the state kids will soon be involved in after school activities during the time of day when mosquitoes are most active so we want parents and schools to remind young people to cover up and use bug spray to help prevent mosquito bites
9212447 this is one more indicator of the tremendous strides massachusetts is making to reduce the ranks of the uninsured
9212448 and were doing it with a robust combination of government subsidized and private insurance
9212449 if i didnt have health insurance i would never have made an appointment with my doctor because of the cost
9212450 the cancer would have spread and i would not be alive today having health insurance saved my life

9212452 i have to give a gold star to my home state this week
9212453 there is continuing debate about how the financial side of this will work out and its clear that everyone is watching massachusetts to see how this experiment goes one fact stood out to me in the reports though the boston globe says that visits by the uninsured to community health centers and hospitals dropped by 37 from july 2007 to september 2007 compared with the same time period the year before

9212455 the firefly populations have dropped 70 percent in the past three years
9212456 when you talk to old people about fireflies it is always the same
9212457 they saw so many when they were young and now they are lucky now if they see one
9212458 i know of populations that have disappeared on my farm because of development and light pollution
9212459 its these mcmansions with their floodlights one house has 32 lights why do you need so many lights
9212460 researchers hope this would allow us to track firefly populations over many years to determine if they are remaining stable or disappearing
9212461 i feel like our way of life is being destroyed
9212462 this will create additional tension and we will have to respond to it in some way naturally using military means

9212726 in a certain sense growing up in a film its difficult ive lived under the spotlights in a period which on the contrary should be full of learning and changing people have the strange feeling they intimately know me just because they saw me becoming from child to woman even if only through a screen

9212750 e una canzone di acid rock lenta sembrano i the pretty things che suonano coi pink floyd
9212751 un delle prime tre canzoni che noel ha registrato nello studio di gem stata composta in modo molto semplice e tranquillo
9212752 un misto di stooges e stone roses con un accenno a the world of twist
9212753 una canzone damore ispirata dallincontro con un angelo ad ibiza
9212754 penso che parli di sara noel pu dire le cose in modo cos diretto che ti colpiscono dritte al cuore
9212755 noel lha suonata la sera prima che fosse registrata fece tutto lui batteria basso chitarra e cantato
9212756 e la canzone pi vecchia dellalbum dei tempi di heathen chemistry non doveva entrare nellalbum ma le linee di basso erano cos potenti
9212757 tre accordi poche note la canzone che volevo scrivere da anni
9212758 cera solo un groove e una linea di basso e noel mi disse che era ok dovevo solo scrivere le parole e una sorta di stream of consciousness
9212759 liam voleva che suonasse come gli who con ginger baker alla batteria durante una battaglia
9212760 e stata scritta in un periodo difficile della mia vita quando il mio matrimonio era in un brutto momento ho insegnato a noel le parti di chitarra e le ha suonate gem suona invece il basso io non faccio niente perch voglio vedere bene se suona come me la immaginavo
9212761 i the coral dissero a noel che questa era una grande canzone io non me la ricordavo era una vecchia demo di liam del 2004 o 2005 credo

9212796 a changing environment will affect alaska more than any other state because of our location im not one though who would attribute it to being man made
9212797 ms palin has made it clear through her actions that she is unwilling to do even as much as the bush administration to address the impacts of global warming
9212798 unfortunately with her support for drilling in the arctic refuge and off our coasts governor palin will simply continue the failed policies of the bush cheney administration and their big oil friends policies that could make us even more dependent on foreign oil
9212799 in fact there is insufficient evidence that polar bears are in danger of becoming extinct within the foreseeable future the possible listing of a healthy species like the polar bear would be based on uncertain modeling of possible effects the center for biological diversity which petitioned for the polar bear to be protected wants the listing to force the government to either stop or severely limit any public or private action that produces or even allows the production of greenhouse gases such limits should be adopted through an open process in which environmental issues are weighed against economic and social needs and where scientists debate and present information that policy makers need to make the best decisions americans should become involved in the issue of climate change by offering suggestions for constructive action to their state governments but listing the polar bear as threatened is the wrong way to get to the right answer
9212800 we believe that the services decision to list the polar bear was not based on the best scientific and commercial data available
9212801 completely ridiculous and a waste of the courts time this lawsuit and her head in the sand approach to global warming only helps oil companies certainly not alaska or the polar bear gov palin should be working for sustainable clean energy development in alaska instead of extinction for the polar bear
9212802 conserving energy and using it more efficiently doesnt necessarily mean you have to sacrifice your quality of life
9212803 its the little things like making sure lights computers and appliances are turned off and slowing down on the road which will save money spent on gasoline
9212804 ignoring the problem reflects a liberal live for today attitude unworthy of our great country
9212805 you have to try to find that chemistry and find the right people that you know are going to be right for your operation what your goals are what your expectations are and knowing how closely were going to be working with the hendrick organization it has to be somebody that the hendrick organization feels comfortable with that we can bring in to work with their people too theres a lot of equations other than saying i like this guy its not near that easy

9213358 information technology which is the future of this nations economy
9213359 i think the problem here may be more of a question of getting rid of the bad internets and keeping the good internets you know cause i think we can all agree therere just too many internets
9213360 the google will have all the same information currently found on regular google but with the added features of not stealing your credit card numbers or giving your computer all kinds of viruses

9213362 but we dont have you know 30 or 100 years or however long telcos have been lobbying congress
9213363 my view of governments used to be that the further we stayed away the better it was
9213364 but boy was that naive because not only do we have the similar agenda as business but we have the same challenges that must be addressed in collaboration

9213372 can t really ban something unless you can define it and no one is offering a definition we can use
9213373 several of the writers of the constitution jefferson and madison i believe were very wary of including the establishment of patents they rightly forsaw the abuses rampant today they reluctantly agreed to including a provision for limited patents and copyrights their fears have been proven correct we should correct their mistake in agreeing to patents as quickly as we can remember the constitution does not mandate patents it only gives congress the power to create them they can be abolished without running afoul of the constitution
9213374 we were investigating cyber vulnerabilities and discovered that the systems were communicating we just had not implemented corrective action prior to the automatic shutdown
9213375 part of the challenge is we have all of this infrastructure in the control systems that was put in place in the 1980s and 90s that was not designed with security in mind and all of sudden these systems are being connected to internet facing business networks
9213376 because this is a competitive business nds also monitors competitors
9213377 nds has done nothing to illegally harm or damage echostar all nds has done is compete hard and fair in the marketplace
9213378 nds came up with a plan take these hackers off the streets and turn them on the competitors
9213379 if the aim of this was to convince others of the salience of a change congress movement of its potential to inspire success and to draw attention and support then losing big in the first important battle is not an effective strategy
9213380 my running and losing big would do more harm than good for that movement

9213397 it is increasingly clear that china may have instituted a block on the import of american films into their country
9213398 although we have not received official confirmation of such a ban from the chinese government or china film the indicators are strong that our information is correct if such action has been taken or is in the process of being taken it would represent an enormous step backwards in terms of chinas efforts to develop a strong and most importantly legitimate film exhibition and distribution market
9213399 my understanding is that there is a suspension which has happened in the past
9213400 i dont deny that ipr infringement and piracy occurs in the chinese market but that doesnt mean the united states is founded to file complaints against china in the wto
9213401 were dealing with a lot of encroachments on our peace of mind were dealing with it simply by accepting it

9213410 the only people for whom dhcp considerations might not apply are isps
9213411 the ip addresses recorded by every website on the planet without additional information should not be considered personal data because these websites usually cannot identify the human beings behind these number strings
9213412 considering an ip address personal makes as much sense as making at amp ts main switchboard phone number personal for any given employee
9213413 protecting our users privacy is something we take very seriously personal information including someones exact location can be gathered from someones ip address so gmail doesnt reveal this information in outgoing mail headers this prevents recipients from being able to track our users or uncover what may be potentially sensitive personal information
9213414 microsoft is very excited to see verizon wireless make such a bold move to satisfy the demands of wireless consumers as peoples mobile needs become more sophisticated and varied they will require smarter and more adaptable mobile devices we are proud to support any open access that puts more power in peoples hands to connect them to the information they want when and where they want it
9213415 the debate about the ov chipcard is symbolic as we discovered yesterday at the hearing for the choice open or closed software the bankruptcy of closed source software shone solidly in the limelight yesterday groenlinks a dutch political party has urged for a long time that the government should work with open source software yesterday it became painfully obvious that we may pay a high price due to the fact that this advice was not followed for the ov chipcard it seems like the responsibility for the risks surrounding the use of closed secret software has not been accepted in any fashion
9213416 s ome of the projects support foreign intelligence collection and analysis generally rather than the cyber security mission particularly
9213417 that is not to say that the proposed projects are not worthwhile but rather that what will be achieved for the more than 17 billion planned by the administration to secure the governments networks is less than what might be expected
9213418 these restrictions preclude public education awareness and debate about the policy and legal issues real or imagined that the initiative poses in the areas of privacy and civil liberties
9213419 it is difficult to conceive how the united states could promulgate a meaningful deterrence doctrine if every aspect of our capabilities and operational concepts is classified
9213420 the greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal well meaning but without understanding
9213421 after years of being lambasted for ignoring cyber security in the last six months the bush administration has embraced the project of locking down government networks with the zeal of a convert
9213422 you dont want to look at that stuff in july
9213423 and you dont want to go out and buy the complete christmas works of olivia newton john you want this song and that song
9213424 it suggests that people have a notion of public domain associated with these older tunes that these songs belong to everyone
9213425 people who grew up in the age of the remix who grew up with file sharing do not perceive it to be a moral problem

9213429 the unforced errors are definitely something we need to address
9213430 weve been doing a pretty good job of that in practice but we need to carry that over to matches we are giving opponents far too many points the high point for us today is the way we played in much of set one
9213431 we played arkansas volleyball obviously we can do good things out there we just have to be more consistent and maintain it

9213437 it also might violate the right to protection of personal data

9213460 in china their students at the top 25 in iq number more than all american students together china has more honors students than we have students
9213461 thundered the principal at which point a parent sitting behind me burst into a frenzied outbreak of applause
9213462 we need to get the poor parents more involved in their kids education
9213463 i need beaver pennsylvania i need you to stand up beside me and say now is the time to bring about change in america
9213464 i think its a myth that they have all this anger
9213465 this would give us serious concerns and may well be a step too far we are not aware of any justification for the state to hold every uk citizens phone and internet records we have real doubts that such a measure can be justified or is proportionate or desirable we have warned before that we are sleepwalking into a surveillance society holding large collections of data is always risky the more data that is collected and stored the bigger the problem when the data is lost traded or stolen
9213466 given ministers appalling record at maintaining the integrity of databases holding peoples sensitive data this could well be more of a threat to our security than a support
9213467 in russian they use tax fraud to get people who dare to have an opinion
9213468 it doesnt matter who is in power the agenda is still served when will we wake up to he falshood of it all
9213469 should we stop at the little chef before or after our robbery of the bak on the high street
9213470 since last october telecoms companies have been required to keep records of phone calls and text messages for 12 months
9213471 those that sacrifice their liberty for added security deserve neither
9213472 everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life his home and his correspondence
9213473 dont care what information they have about me because i dont have anything to hide lee mclennan
9213474 everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life his home and his correspondence
9213475 we have warned before that we are sleepwalking into a surveillance society
9213476 any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a little security will deserve neither and lose both
9213477 this crazy scheme undermines everything that a fair and democratic society stands for
9213478 any people that would give up liberty for a little temporary safety deserves neither liberty nor safety
9213479 he causes all both small and great rich and poor free and slave to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name
9213480 increasingly undermine our current capabilities to obtain communications data and use it to protect the public
9213481 but britain is one of the last places i would expect to have this kind of big brother state
9213482 right now in the second week of may 2006 we are facing perhaps the worst gas crisis in history
9213483 we have way too much gasoline gas is down to 19 cents a gallon and the oil companies are hurting i know that i am partly to blame by insisting that cars run on trash i am therefore proposing a federal bail out to our oil companies because hey if it were the other way around you know the oil companies would help us
9213484 i think he brought it to a new level of attention and validity that we hadnt had before
9213485 al gore has been warning us of the dangers of climate change for more than twenty years
9213486 when al won an academy award for his fine documentary an inconvenient truth i was thrilled america was finally listening to the lecture hed given me every week for eight years
9213487 he had written a great book before he was chosen as vice president
9213488 its easy to take shots its part of being a public figure and being in public office you catch a lot of arrows
9213489 al gore knew more about the importance of the rain forest than the scientists
9213490 i asked him a couple of questions and he began a tutorial flying 30 000 feet over the rain forest he told us how the important the rain forest was to the environment and how it affected weather patterns i didnt know that stuff it was one of those life changing moments that ill never forget
9213491 we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
9213492 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
9213493 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
9213494 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
9213495 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9213496 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time
9213497 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
9213498 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists that actually attacked us on 9 11
9213499 you know john mccain likes to say he will follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
9213500 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
9213501 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
9213502 doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
9213503 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
9213504 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
9213505 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
9213506 if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
9213507 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
9213508 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
9213509 obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
9213510 gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9213511 she shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9213512 gov palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade
9213513 the last thing women need is a president and vice president who are prepared to turn back the clock on womens rights and repeal the protections of roe v wade
9213514 when as many as three supreme court justices could be appointed in the first term of the next president and john mccain promises to appoint more scalias and thomases and end a womans right to choose it is time for a change
9213515 in an era when over 80 percent of downs syndrome babies are aborted the palins feel they have been extremely blessed by god to raise an absolutely perfect son
9213516 gov palin continues to use her testimony to advance protections for unborn children
9213517 will i get a nominee who will keep his word to me in the vetting process if any word is actually given
9213518 we all know that dance nobody actually admits they ask the roe question and the question doesnt get asked and it doesnt get answered and therefore the nominees get on the bench and they do what they want
9213519 a president who ends the global scourge of aids in our time
9213520 the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation
9213521 but surely we can agree that our gay brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
9213522 even during the cold war during the harsh confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we always avoided direct clashes between our civilians even more so between our military personnel
9213523 ordinary experts even if they teach military affairs should not do so in combat zones but in training areas and training centers
9213524 what was the purpose of that gentleman being among the special forces and what is he doing today i so far cannot answer
9213525 as a follow up to my below post picking a female vp makes it very difficult for obama to execute the second part of his strategy painting mccain as the same as bush
9213526 maybe they wont notice that i am taking john mccains straight talk express campaign themes
9213527 i dont think so america knows mccain just sold out the country for a politic tactical stunt the woman has no experience on diversity of economics no national experience with any issue if the 72 year old kicks the bucket so would we as a country this woman is soooooo under qualified
9213528 now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses
9213529 wont even follow bin laden to the cave where he lives
9213530 for many americans the exciting young candidate who won the iowa caucuses had the promise of being a new kind of politician entirely better than and different from the political norm of bitterness and calculation
9213531 to be honest as much as americans politics is a fun spectator sport i personally havent seen it significantly influence a campaign in canada
9213532 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
9213533 in a stadium like this it felt like one living organism
9213534 people are really going to see which venue looks more like america and its this one
9213535 he thoroughly and compellingly explained his plan for change with specific distinctions between what government should be responsible for and personal responsibility
9213536 we must also admit that programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need
9213537 i cant imagine why youd have a hard time making up your mind
9213538 its important to understand how our democracy works not just looking on television but to participate is important to me
9213539 i believe we wouldnt be in iraq in his administration mcnally said
9213540 i think you get the handlers in there and you just get lost
9213541 if one started to use biofuels and in reality that policy led to an increase in greenhouse gases rather than a decrease that would obviously be insane
9213542 dont expect much honesty transparency or accountability from climate armageddonites
9213543 observed climate change and the negligible global effect of greenhouse gas emission limits in the state of colorado
9213544 the system of modern capitalism will generate ever larger environmental consequences outstripping efforts to manage them
9213545 it is unimaginable that american politics as we know it will deliver the transformative changes needed
9213546 it really has nothing to do with his stand on global warming
9213547 hes a great faculty member hes an institution at csu
9213548 right now the united states imports about 70 of its oil from overseas at the same time billions of dollars that we spend on all that foreign oil seems to end up in the bank accounts of those around the world who are openly hostile to american values and our way of life this costly reliance on fossil fuels threatens america and the world in other ways too co2 emissions are increasing global temperatures sea levels are rising and storms are getting worse
9213549 borrowing money from china to buy oil from saudi arabia
9213550 borrow ing money from china to buy oil from countries that dont like us
9213551 as i have said for many years throughout this land were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
9213552 the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for everything its worth
9213553 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
9213554 we must seize this opportunity to elect united states of america
9213555 if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis
9213556 the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9213557 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of mankind
9213558 sees the fundamental cause of the worlds problems in the very expansion of homo sapiens
9213559 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
9213560 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
9213561 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
9213562 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
9213563 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
9213564 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
9213565 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
9213566 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
9213567 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
9213568 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
9213569 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
9213570 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
9213571 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
9213572 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
9213573 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
9213574 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
9213575 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
9213576 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
9213577 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
9213578 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
9213579 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
9213580 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
9213581 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
9213582 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
9213583 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
9213584 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
9213585 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
9213586 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
9213587 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
9213588 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
9213589 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
9213590 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
9213591 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
9213592 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
9213593 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
9213594 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
9213595 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
9213596 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
9213597 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
9213598 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
9213599 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
9213600 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
9213601 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
9213602 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too

9213607 a well made cup of coffee is the proper beginning to an idle day its aroma is beguiling its taste is sweet yet it leaves behind only bitterness and regret in that it resembles surely the pleasures of love although in this case it seems to taste of nothing much except mud with perhaps a faint aftertaste of rotten apricots

9213644 we knew what we were going to get today in bolton we had to defend a thousand corners it felt like but it shows the character of our team to be able to do that
9213645 i think particularly in the first half we dominated the football match and should have been in front and then we probably had the best chance of the game and didnt finish it off
9213646 so were disappointed with a point but at the same time it was a game we could have easily lost i have never known a team to get so many free kicks it was frightening
9213647 this team will score goals we have had three matches in the premier league and have done exceptionally well in all of them
9213648 i dont think the points tally reflects our play but i am a big believer in performance levels
9213649 after 15 games lets see where we are not after two or three i think if we play as well as we have done these first three games then we will win plenty of matches
9213650 borja picked some lovely passes up and broke away and caused problems but he is not up to the pace yet
9213651 he is not up to the fitness levels required for the premiership and he is finding the physicality of the league difficult
9213652 thats why hes getting a bit of a game here a bit of game there hopefully in a month or two he will be up to the pace
9213653 we will keep working hard it has been a long transfer window and i am particularly looking forward to when it closes
9213654 hopefully there is one or two more additions that will help the team and on the evidence of the first three games we dont need that much help
9213655 we can confirm that two bodies were recovered last night from the main part of osbaston house maesbrook

9213657 it is going to be a painstaking and lengthy process before the full examination of the house and its surrounds is completed

9213693 now he was throwing easily but he was in good spirits said riley in his day after remarks following a 36 28 loss at stanford in the season opener
9213694 everything we got from the doctor said he should work on range of motion and throw then just see how it goes
9213695 we wont hurry him and i dont anticipate him playing this week
9213696 its just what we knew said riley of the game which osu basically gave away with three turnovers and another error that led to a safety
9213697 but one thing after it was all said and done there was a lot of good learning to be done thats what we have to do with it
9213698 you cant do that very often and expect to win he said we already know that its always been our m o stopping the run those are the things penalties fumbles run defense that hit you right between the eyes but there was a ton of good football and a lot of good defense
9213699 it will be good to have al back said riley afalava had to sit game 1 because of his off season dui
9213700 played very well and he can even make some more throws he had some stuff hes like to have back the pick to bo mcnally but in terms of playing the game that was right in front of him he did a nice job
9213701 i dont think weve seen everything hes got said riley
9213702 theres plenty of football there for both of them said riley
9213703 hes a big fast back and he kept his pads down said the coach
9213704 we didnt wrap up and bounced off his pads basically thats what happened we got misaligned once and he cut out on us another time i think we had three guys hit him and then our corner tim clark over ran the play on the backside
9213705 we dont want to live like that with 54 passes in a game said riley
9213706 thats really not our style i dont think thats where were at our best

9213709 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride
9213710 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
9213711 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
9213712 we need to do a really exceptional episodic piece every episode is just going to be like a punch in the face itll be exciting dramatic and tragic all at the same time
9213713 its not going to change its not a family show
9213714 were still going to be on after 9 p m torchwood s a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are
9213715 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
9213716 the woodbury police are excited because they got something thats more serious than a cat up a tree

9213719 that to me is ridiculous i dont understand how that can happen

9213721 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl told him that he had come up with a plan on how to murder someone
9213722 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl wanted to find an adult male who lived by himself and within walking distance of the defendants house
9213723 mr busskohl stated that he would then either stab the potential victim in the chest or slash his throat mr busskohl told mr eischens that he would then either cut off the eyelids of the victim or cut out his heart
9213724 im not even sure i would have gone through with it
9213725 the evidence i received busskohl discussed very openly these things with the police
9213726 within eight to 10 hours the bizarre type of thinking he was undergoing was gone
9213727 if anybody were to meet him and talk to him at this point he represents no threat to anyone
9213728 i didnt even look at it as a murder plot until they actually started putting it on the news
9213729 what bothers me is if you throw a rock hes about four blocks away
9213730 which is a substantial step toward and more than preparation for the commission of the crime
9213731 but if we have somebody thats just simply preparing to commit the crime and does not take a substantial step toward committing that crime we cant charge an attempt and thats what this is all about
9213732 if it wasnt for his friend and the grace of god thatd be it

9213743 it is beyond anything incredible that god should have willed the kingdoms of men their dominations and their servitudes to be outside the range of the laws of his providence
9213744 i think there are some advantages to deferring but we have played in an awful lot of games where when we win the toss we take the ball and we have done well in a lot of those games as well
9213745 i dont know if there is anything to getting the ball and having first crack at it or giving it up and having that first possession in the second half

9213810 and i didnt have a kitchen table and i didnt have a chair
9213811 i was just talking to some people in ohio where they continue to lose jobs they continue to lose their homes
9213812 ive got to give them a specific and strong plan of action
9213813 in difficult times weve had a bush administration and voters want change
9213814 ive got to make a convincing case that i represent the right kind of change based on my record and outlining a strong agenda
9213815 sure i do sure i do and its a documented fact that it was the dnc that went after me first and the 527s political groups and the unions
9213816 but the fact is people should have a sense of humor
9213817 let me say sen obama made a choice about iraq and he chose to say the surge wouldnt work he said it would fail he got the nomination in large degree by going to the far left of his party on iraq
9213818 i chose the path which was least popular im not questioning his patriotism im questioning his judgment and i will continue to question his judgment and his qualifications to lead
9213819 what i hear from everybody i know is that i dont talk about it enough
9213820 people keep saying to me talk about it more we need to hear your personal story how you made a choice for your country when you refused to come home early i think that sen obama has a great story to tell and certainly i dont begrudge him telling it
9213821 theyre not going to speak theyre not going to do any politicking or campaigning theyre just part of our family and its appropriate for our family be there
9213822 both of them are on duty so theyll be leaving right after the convention is over back to their duties
9213823 sure im nervous particularly given the fact that sen obama is probably the greatest speaker of our time
9213824 independentemente da escolha o sport ser um time de muita pegada para nivelar com nosso advers rio neste aspecto se tivermos essa pegada toda estaremos dando um grande passo para o triunfo pois em casa sempre somos ofensivos
9213825 leandro um jogador de muita qualidade e uma pessoa de excelente car ter por isso as portas do clube est o abertas para o seu retorno depende apenas dele

9213827 estou tranq ilo as coisas no futebol nem sempre s o f ceis eu vinha trabalhando com honestidade e dedica o e nada estava dando certo s tenho que agradecer a deus por ter tido paci ncia e continuado a trabalhar com seriedade hoje me sinto muito mais confiante e at mesmo nos treinamentos as jogadas j est o dando certo eu j me sinto mais vontade para partir para cima dos zagueiros
9213828 eu nunca deixei de trabalhar eu me dedicava nos treinamentos at com um pouco de raiva da situa o pois sabia que eu n o merecia passar por aquilo mas quando a bola come a a entrar tudo fica mais tranq ilo espero manter a boa fase e ajudar o sport a chegar pelo menos entre os seis primeiros do campeonato
9213829 um jogador que a gente sabe que tem qualidade t cnica e que n o estava conseguindo desenvolv la est vamos sempre conversando com ele fazendo at mesmo algumas edi es individuais das filmagens dos jogos para mostrar a ele o que estava errado e o que tinha que ser melhorado felizmente ele p de ter uma sequ ncia e os gols voltaram a aparecer mas um jogador que pode apresentar uma evolu o ainda maior
9213830 quieren hacer sentir su poder por su juventud y por una necesidad de protagonismo
9213831 creo que sienten una necesidad de reafirmarse porque todav a no se lo creen
9213832 y a muchas les cuesta manejar estos temas de manera objetiva
9213833 los jefes suelen dar rdenes que el subalterno no comprende lo que genera malas interpretaciones

9213846 choice of palin promises failed energy policies of the past
9213847 protecting polar bears gets in way of drilling for oil says governor
9213848 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9213849 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9213850 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9213851 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9213852 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9213853 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9213854 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9213855 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9213856 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9213857 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9213858 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9213859 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9213860 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9213861 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9213862 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9213863 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9213864 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9213865 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9213866 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9213867 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9213868 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9213869 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9213870 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9213871 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9213872 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9213873 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9213874 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9213875 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9213876 who are open to doing something on the production side
9213877 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9213878 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9213879 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9213880 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9213881 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9213882 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9213883 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9213884 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9213885 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9213886 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9213887 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9213888 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9213889 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9213890 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9213891 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9213892 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9213893 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9213894 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9213895 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9213896 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9213897 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9213898 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9213899 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9213900 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9213901 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9213902 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9213903 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9213904 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9213905 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9213906 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9213907 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9213908 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9213909 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9213910 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table

9214243 how you can go through all these justifications and gyrations and not begin to have the slightest clue that you are in fact a monumental fucktard is quite beyond me they should force death row inmates to read your usenet anthology the rampant dumbfuckery would probably give them an extremely cost effective brain embolysm

9214309 talk is cheap especially in rock n roll all that matters are the music and the performances melding the funk and swagger of the 70s with modern arrangements harmonies and lyrics zo2 is single handedly infusing the rock world with the energy and excitement it has so long been missing

9214313 id like to give you a piece of my mind
9214314 before you hire a company to build a house you would i expect insist on detailed plans showing what the finished structure was going to look like building a childs mind and character is what public schools do their justification for prematurely breaking family and neighborhood learning where is documentary evidence to prove this assumption that trained and certified professionals do it better than people who know and love them can there isnt any the cost in new york state for building a well schooled child in the year 2000 is 200 000 per body when lost interest is calculated that capital sum invested in the childs name over the past twelve years would have delivered a million dollars to each kid as a nest egg to compensate for having no school the original 200 000 is more than the average home in new york costs you wouldnt build a home without some idea what it would look like when finished but you are compelled to let a corps of perfect strangers tinker with your childs mind and personality without the foggiest idea what they want to do with it

9214320 the palin selection completely undercuts the argument about obamas inexperience and readiness to lead to gratuitously undercut the remarkably successful is he ready to lead line of attack seems near suicidal
9214321 i realize of course that shes totally unqualified to be president at this point in time if mccain were to die in february 2009 i hope palin would have the good sense to appoint someone who is more ready to be president to be her vice president on the understanding that she would then resign and be appointed vice president by her successor
9214322 can anyone say with a straight face that palin would have gotten picked if she were a man
9214323 the longer i think about it the less well this selection sits with me and i increasingly doubt that it will prove good politics the palin choice looks cynical its a wild gamble undertaken by our oldest ever first time candidate for president in hopes of changing the board of this election campaign maybe it will work but maybe and at least as likely it will reinforce a theme that id be pounding home if i were the obama campaign that its john mccain for all his white hair who represents the risky choice while it is barack obama who offers cautious steady predictable governance if it were your decision and you were putting your country first would you put an untested small town mayor a heartbeat away from the presidency
9214324 as much as i loathe obama biden i cant in good conscience vote for a mccain palin ticket palin has absolutely no experience in foreign affairs considering both mccains advanced age and the state of the world today it is essential that the veep be exceedingly qualified to assume the office of president i simply dont have any confidence in palins ability to deal effectively with iran russia china etc
9214325 on the face of it mccain has failed the ultimate test that any presidential candidate must face in picking a running mate selecting someone who is unambiguously qualified to be president
9214326 looks like a real reformer shes done what obamas talked about

9214330 no way is craig fit for international football and ive told him and john toshack the wales manager exactly that even though hes called him up
9214331 he has just come back and 20 minutes was all he could do even then he kept asking me to wait and wait its a similar story with george mccartney even though he was capable of 45 minutes after his injury

9214338 its no secret weve been evaluating a specific monthly data usage or bandwidth threshold for our comcast high speed internet residential customers for some time
9214339 we need to remember that the amount of usage we are talking about more than 250gb a month does not apply to more than 99 percent of our customers so the less than 1 percent who are notified today receive a phone call from comcast asking them to moderate their usage which the vast majority of them do voluntarily
9214340 for arius to apply the notion of begetting to gods own substance is to take a notion from greek mythology and apply it illegitimately to the biblical god according to the entire hebrew tradition and therefore also according to the new testament the model for understanding god in his activity is not the model of generation and sexual reproduction so dear to greek mythology but the model of the artisan who makes and the king who governs the arian party therefore looked upon this theological use of the model of begetting by athanasius and his supporters as one of the most corrupt paganizations of christianity

9214371 senator mccains choice for a running mate is beyond belief by choosing sarah palin mccain has clearly made a decision to continue the bush legacy of destructive environmental policies
9214372 sarah palin whose husband works for bp formerly british petroleum has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment
9214373 however the analysis is still ongoing and no decisions have yet been made
9214374 its my belief given the improvement in the security situation in iraq that there will be a continued withdrawal of u s forces as promised by gen petraeus at his last congressional hearing later this fall
9214375 my sense is that i will be able to make a recommendation at that time for some further reductions
9214376 we thank egyptian president hosni mubarak for opening the crossing today and we hope the opening days will be extended
9214377 if there is any dna evidence that would be a surprise to me

9214379 i the prime minister have come to office in the righteous way and i wont resign
9214380 i will not back down i will rule this country and will lead it through all of the problems
9214381 the coalition partners have the impression that the situation is deteriorating and we are thinking of telling the prime minister to decide on the future of the government
9214382 the main problem we face is a lack of equipment that detects explosives
9214383 the iraqi government released him and in fact they released a lot of people like him
9214384 the defendants sometimes pay a judge or bring in a witness and then they go free

9214400 the nod goes to jill dalton for her lizzie borden in
9214401 i heartily recommend you see lizzie borden live complex and most interesting lizzie in the person of jill dalton
9214402 absorbing performance dalton runs the gamut of emotions from supposedly mild christian woman to that of a ruthless murderer
9214403 everything from jills facial features like lizzie herself to the way her voice can change throughout the play makes for compelling and oddly sympathetic viewing
9214404 truly superb the script is fascinating jill dalton is an astonishingly talented actress she changes her mood and characters in a split second the play should get a pulitzer

9214432 i cant begin this great effort without honoring the achievement of geraldine ferraro in 1984 and of course hillary clinton who showed determination in her presidential campaign
9214433 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9214434 as for that vp talk all the time i cant answer until someone answers me what is it exactly that a vp does every day

9214447 i want to vote for a candidate who cares more about barney smith than smith barney
9214448 senator mccain has lost any chance of having a balanced or moderate ticket with this choice and has instead opted for the same business as usual reliance on the outdated oil companies that has been the hallmark of the bush cheney administration on the third anniversary of the hurricane that knocked loose oil rigs and spilled millions of gallons of oil into the gulf coast that is bracing for another hit mccain is sending a terribly indifferent message by selecting a candidate who only repeats big oils talking points

9214461 last night i lay in bed looking up at the stars in the sky and i thought to myself where the heck is the ceiling
9214462 not to oppose error is to approve it and not to defend truth is to suppress it and indeed to neglect to confound evil men when we can do it is no less a sin than to encourage them

9214465 depressed patients who succumb to this pressure will be drugged unconscious and die from dehydration usually within five to 10 days nothing in the bill prohibits this horror
9214466 ab 2747 pushes suicide through the back door at the hands of non taking advantage of depressed patients

9214469 who could be mistakenly diagnosed as terminally ill but would have many many full years of life ahead
9214470 the bill does not otherwise attempt to expressly define terminal that each of these health care professionals would have to diagnose to trigger the offer of end of life options it is not clear why nurse practitioners and could make such a significant diagnosis it is further not clear from the bill how making such significant diagnoses on a case by case basis can be done by such practitioners and assistants based on so called standardized procedures and protocols not further defined by the bill the potential effect of ab 2747 is extremely broad and could cause irrevocable harm
9214471 we really go down a slippery slope when we contemplate the ending of life in such a way that it could be coerced you have people in a very precarious situation in a very awkward situation that when thrust upon them with options to end their life you have people that may feel like they have no use anymore they feel like theyre not of value anymore and that taking one of these options they may feel is the only way out that theyve become a burden to their family or to someone else i would hate to put people in that kind of position theyre already feeling vulnerable and now confronted with ways to end your life this is a very delicate and i think dangerous idea here you could have people like heirs that are to get the estate started and quietly coercing people into making decisions like this
9214472 few trends could so thoroughly undermine the very foundations of our free society as the acceptance by corporate officials of a social responsibility other than to make as much money for their stockholders as possible

9214535 we will only be able to tell the extent after the water recedes
9214536 they are refugees now because they have left their homes they are living in the forests and they should be brought back
9214537 it is the responsibility of the government that these refugees should be brought back and also to send for force if necessary to stop this killing to stop this burning to stop this looting
9214538 i express spiritual closeness and solidarity to the brothers and sisters in faith who are being so harshly tested
9214539 its never been done because the issues have been too big to surmount
9214540 the most diplomatic way of saying it is that there are just a lot of moving parts
9214541 so youd have a multiplicity of players on that side

9214550 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying
9214551 but we expect certain sanctions which wont be against the people but against the political elite
9214552 organising a celebration of peace and sport in an area near where there was a massacre and a war of aggression seems to me to be a strange idea
9214553 we have long ago recognised the borders of modern day ukraine
9214554 agreed on the need to put an end to attempts to use the situation surrounding georgia to raise tensions in europe by speculating on non existent threats concerning other post soviet countries
9214555 all the relevant players are here in south africa at the moment and i think the length of the discussion will be determined by what progress they make
9214556 i need managers i want workers people who take people to work i do not want people with own business i want one business the peoples business
9214557 lets us be united lets not be destroyers of our party we have destroyed part of it now that we have survived lets ensure the party is strengthened
9214558 i cant explain just how happy i am to be helping conquest racing this weekend and to get my first start in the indycar series this will be a great opportunity for me to show what i can do im aware that it will not be easy for me coming in at the last minute and learning a new car in a new racing series but im definitely motivated on doing my best and helping conquest this weekend
9214559 i couldnt give my all today because of my left hand i was turning into the pits with just one hand on the steering wheel and was unable to do my best the track is bumpy and it was really hard on my hand i hate having to miss a race but i prefer leaving the car to alex tagliani this weekend while i rest up my hand in order for it to get better
9214560 its unfortunate what happened to enrique in sonoma last week and that its causing him to miss this weeks race on the other hand im happy to be welcoming alex into the team this weekend obviously it will be a big challenge for him as he will not get that much time in the car before the race but alex has a lot of experience especially on street courses and hes raced here in the past as well i think he will be able to adapt quickly to his new racing environment and it will be interesting to see how he does this weekend
9214561 the fact that he took the flag and excelled racing in formula one he was kind of a hero for all of us in the united states during that period he had great talent i got to know phil when his son and my son were racing in atlantics and he was very dedicated to motorsports and just a great guy the cars were a lot different than today but the idea is the same to get in the car and make it go as fast as you can accept the challenges and go racing
9214562 this is another great opportunity to spend time with friends from home and see them play its rare that we get to see each other in action i know they wanted to come to the track today but they had some obligations that kept that from happening im fortunate to be able to have chance to see the game tonight ive never seen the tigers play ive heard nothing but great things about the ballpark and their staff im really grateful for everyone making this possible and to meet and spend time with all the players before the game its going to be a fun night
9214563 we pride ourselves on spending most of our time on strategy as a team i think we still have that in our pocket and our position on pit lane definitely helps during the race hopefully we can save some fuel and keep that going there is going to be a lot of people trying different strategies to improve their positions a lot of the guys and girls eight to 10 starting spots back are going to try some pretty crazy things well keep our mind focused on the race and try to go for the win
9214564 i dont how it was easy for helio castroneves but i always find here you have to push so hard in qualifying i find this qualifying format really amazing it really asks a lot from the drivers if youre not a driver i dont think you can understand how much we have to push and how many times usually in qualifying you always find some magic from somewhere here you have to do it two sets of tires per segment youre really pushing so hard at the end in the last segment and you really need to have tires and pressures to be a one hit wonder im really happy to be able to put it together obviously we didnt have enough for scott dixon at all i dont know how he put that lap together im happy for the team to be third again and showing that we are closer and closer to the big guys
9214565 it was a pretty stressful day we didnt think we were going to make it into the firestone fast six we were very quick and things were going well but we were never got to do a full timed lap in the first session so there was a risk of not making it to the second round but one quick lap at the end got us into the next 12 then we were third in the next session and i wasnt happy with my lap in the final six but i suppose well make the most of it and hopefully finish on the podium with my teammate
9214566 it was the usual extremely competitive qualifying session its a little disappointing i havent been 100 percent happy with the balance around here yet we keep working on it and we definitely made some gains being in the top six again is great it was a good effort from team penske and certainly put us in a good position for the race
9214567 we have been performing extremely well in all of the road courses wherever we go this year it really shows the consistency of the competitiveness
9214568 the track is rubbering in so it is getting better but actually you notice the difference from the start of qualifying to the end of it because it is really warming up in the middle of the day anyway and was getting hotter and hotter heading to the fast six i think the balance was changing a little bit for me it is always like that in these qualifying sessions and really keeps you on your toes
9214569 it was a pretty good run and the car was really good at the end of the day we came up just a little short but we were happy to be in the firestone fast six
9214570 this track is so particular that if you make one wrong change you can lose a full second the team 7 eleven car was close to making it but i didnt know what else to do we made a change and it went the wrong way and of course we missed the firestone fast six for only the second time its definitely disappointing
9214571 i was really hoping to get the motorola car into the firestone fast six today but we lost a little time during the second run we are just a little off the lead pack and hopefully we can figure out that small piece that we are missing by the time the race starts tomorrow but we were able to get into the fast 12 these past two weekends so we are definitely headed in the right direction on the road courses
9214572 i was a bit disappointed with qualifying but for what its worth this is as close as we have been yesterday wasnt very productive because we tried to adapt my driving style to that of danicas patrick and tonys kanaan because they were quick i just wasnt able to do that and it cost us the entire day today we tried to develop a car that worked for me and we improved but came up a bit short of the second qualifying session
9214573 theres a lot to learn in so little time i was rusty a little bit getting back behind the wheel of an open wheel car but i feel good in the car it was just very little time to get ready plus its a very difficult street course and different from what i raced on in 2001 but we did pick up a lot of time from what the team did yesterday my goal is to get the best out of the car and give as much information as i can to the team this team is great and they are doing a fantastic job
9214574 im pretty happy with our qualifying effort we were only two tenths of a second off the transfer spot in our group im also happy about how much we improved the no 2 lilly car from yesterday it seemed to be more in line with some of the other guys its good for us to be a lot closer to our competition than we have been in the past on road or street courses we are starting 17 th and thats one of our better qualifying efforts on a street course so im pretty happy with it and i hope to have a good race tomorrow
9214575 we were a lot better than that qualifying session showed between tomas scheckter and bruno junqueira bringing out two full course yellows in a 20 minute session it just makes it a mess when you try to go out for the green everyone is trying to find space and not going in a place like this its impossible to find space out there its disappointing we could have and should have been able to qualify better if only we had had the opportunity to do so but the way the session went i didnt get any laps
9214576 we have a great car i knew this was going to be between scott dixon and me it will be very close between both of us on the second round i decided to predict a little bit what the track might have with the thicker tires and we made a very small change but those changes were enough to unfortunately make the car a little bit difficult and loose we changed and went back out there that change definitely proved that was bad when we got to the slower section turns 4 5 and 6 the car just lost the edge on the tire for it to turn quick and unfortunately that edge was enough to make the gap between scott and me so i really tried i was pushing as hard as i could but unfortunately we couldnt put in a better lap second is not bad actually its pretty good were going to try to do everything we can to win the race tomorrow
9214577 were slowly making progress we just need to keep working on it theres obviously been some changes since last year with everything we didnt qualify where we wanted to but i think well be able to have a good race well just have to work on our fuel strategy this will probably be another fuel race weve done well when it seems to come down to that
9214578 we are improving with every practice and the car was better today since this is my first time at belle isle it is tougher when i have to learn the track while preparing for the race weekend

9214628 gdp in common parlance stands for gross domestic product or the aggregate value of all the goods and services produced on these blessed shores
9214629 national account corporate profits declined at a 9 2 rate in the second quarter
9214630 the income gdi and growth gdp figures should theoretically match
9214631 despite this some analysts argue that q2 data overestimated the true pace of real growth because the government underestimated inflation this argument is bolstered by some very interesting developments in the gdp accounts which show that nominal gdp grew at a very weak 3 annual rate in q2 1 9 real gdp growth and a surprisingly low 1 1 inflation rate the reason the governments estimate of gdp inflation was so low was because of the way the data is calculated gdp consumption investment govt spending exports minus imports so the argument goes the absurdly low 1 1 gdp inflation was just a technical artifact of the way the government calculates gdp deflating nominal gdp with a 4 inflation rate calculated by including the 28 jump in import prices would push q2 real gdp into negative territory for pessimists this is an appealing argument fortunately its not true if import prices are added back into inflation then the total dollar volume of imports must be added back into nominal gdp as well this is the only way to compare apples to apples adding back imports pushes nominal gdp growth to 5 5 at an annual rate in q2 then using the 4 inflation data that includes import prices means real gdp growth was still positive by 1 5 or so a second issue to think about is that unlike the consumer price index cpi which attempts to measure changes in the cost of the things we buy gdp inflation is designed to measure changes in the prices of the things we produce regardless of whether the purchasers are foreign or domestic due to oil prices for the items americans buy have been increasing much more rapidly than the items they produce as a result gdp inflation looks artificially low when in reality it is not comparable to the cpi

9214672 i arrived at ledra palace at 3pm and after the initial compliments mr zerihoun informed me that he had received a letter from the turkish cypriots informing him that they would deny entry to the kato pyrgos residents for an organised pilgrimage through the limnitis road
9214673 this of course is very sad news it is truly a small hearted and provocative decision
9214674 in view of this i made the decision that i couldnt go ahead with my scheduled meeting with mr nami
9214675 i responded that i was definitely willing to meet whenever he wanted to discuss these issues which not only are a result of todays meeting but also the many others that preceded this one regarding the opening of the limnitis checkpoint
9214676 mr nami was there when i arrived and indeed we started a preliminary discussion but i think mr nami felt the need to inform me of this development so he interrupted and told me about it
9214677 but he did express the hope that this would not affect the talks that will begin on september 3
9214678 we must stay calm i was completely calm i state the reasons why i couldnt continue discussions i think it was a calm and correct decision when they are ready to truly talk then we will see what to do
9214679 because it is not possible for negotiations to be taking place under such shadows and provocative actions

9214711 im currently stuck in krabi southern thailand i have a flight out of bangkok tonight but as the airport and now rail links have been taken over by the pad protest group peoples alliance for democracy it seems unlikely i will be able to catch the flight
9214712 i have been in krabi airport this morning and the atmosphere was one of quiet celebration i at no time felt threatened or uneasy and the protestors actually apologised for the inconvenience
9214713 it was very eerie though to see a busy airport reduced to an empty building with no planes in sight and a group of protestors huddled on the runway under the shade of some boarding stairs
9214714 for the last couple of days its just been wandering around as a tropical storm we kept expecting it to increase in intensity

9214721 football is a game where when you win everyone sings and dances and celebrates but when you lose you moan and are miserable well keep working hard and turn the results round
9214722 we were absolutely disappointed to lose so late on once again we passed the ball well and created not clear cut chances but half chances
9214723 unfortunately we didnt score and then conceded one and lost the game
9214724 it looked like we were going to get a share of the points it looked like there was only going to be one goal if anyone was to score unfortunately they scored it
9214725 obviously were delighted to get the first three points but ive been trying to make the point all week that we felt we were in form last week we played ever so well and didnt win
9214726 we werent playing without confidence but with celtic and rangers coming up next those are two games that we could just as easily lose
9214727 so to go into those two games without a win would have made us feel a little bit uncomfortable

9214733 theres also this issue that on april 18th she gave birth to a baby with downs syndrome children with downs syndrome require an awful lot of attention the role of vice president it seems to me would take up an awful lot of her time and it raises the issue of how much time will she have to dedicate to her newborn child
9214734 thats a very good question and i guess my guess is that perhaps the line inside the mccain campaign would be if it were a man being picked who also had a baby but you know four months ago with downs syndrome would you ask the same question
9214735 im not being stubborn im just refusing to do it

9214758 church building is the only industry in many parts of poverty hit rural orissa and the missionaries are targeting poor and illiterate people
9214759 i am a threat to no one mr obama doesnt trump my constitutional rights the president of the united states doesnt trump my constitutional rights
9214760 i had a bible in one hand and an apple in the other i was going to pass out my fliers on the rights of law abiding americans to carry guns but i never got the chance
9214761 our people did talk to him he never entered the event area
9214762 didnt even give me a receipt for it there were lots of violations of my constitutional rights
9214763 dude i have to tell you the truth were renting a studio near north thats 400 bucks cheaper than this and its way more spacious than what youve got here sorry
9214764 there have been some recent signs that our economy is beginning to improve
9214765 there are families across our country struggling to make ends meet
9214766 to transition we must enter a state in which we are no longer who we once were and yet we are not who we must become we have to be willing to stand in the open gap and momentarily risk being nothing
9214767 and after the exhibition tryphaena again received her thecla for her daughter falconilla had died and said to her in a dream mother you shall have this stranger thecla in my place in order that she may pray concerning me and
9214768 the citizen of a prominent city i erected this while i lived that i might have a resting place for my body
9214769 t hat very night this was shown to me in a vision i perpetua saw dinocrates going out from a gloomy place where also there were several others and he was parched and very thirsty with a filthy countenance and pallid color and the wound on his face which he had when he died this dinocrates had been my brother after the flesh seven years of age who died miserably with disease for him i had made my prayer and between him and me there was a large interval so that neither of us could approach to the other and i knew that my brother was in suffering but i trusted that my prayer would bring help to his suffering and i prayed for him every day until we passed over into the prison of the camp for we were to fight in the camp show then i made my prayer for my brother day and night groaning and weeping that he might be granted to me then on the day on which we remained in fetters this was shown to me i saw that the place which i had formerly observed to be in gloom was now bright and dinocrates with a clean body well clad was finding refreshment and he went away from the water to play joyously after the manner of children and i awoke then i understood that he was translated from the place of punishment
9214770 we offer sacrifices for the dead on their birthday anniversaries
9214771 a woman after the death of her husband prays for his soul and asks that he may while waiting find rest and that he may share in the first resurrection and each year on the anniversary of his death she offers the sacrifice
9214772 then we make mention also of those who have already fallen asleep first the patriarchs prophets apostles and martyrs that through their prayers and supplications god would receive our petition next we make mention also of the holy fathers and bishops who have already fallen asleep and to put it simply of all among us who have already fallen asleep for we believe that it will be of very great benefit to the souls of those for whom the petition is carried up while this holy and most solemn sacrifice is laid out
9214773 if a man distinguish in himself what is peculiarly human from that which is irrational and if he be on the watch for a life of greater urbanity for himself in this present life
9214774 let us help and commemorate them if jobs sons were purified by their fathers sacrifice job 1 5 why would we doubt that our offerings for the dead bring them some consolation let us not hesitate to help those who have died and to offer our prayers for them
9214775 weep for those who die in their wealth and who with all their wealth prepared no consolation for their own souls who had the power to wash away their sins and did not will to do it let us weep for them let us assist them to the extent of our ability let us think of some assistance for them small as it may be yet let us somehow assist them but how and in what way by praying for them and by entreating others to pray for them by constantly giving alms to the poor on their behalf not in vain was it decreed by the apostles that in the awesome mysteries remembrance should be made of the departed they knew that here there was much gain for them much benefit when the entire people stands with hands uplifted a priestly assembly and that awesome sacrificial victim is laid out how when we are calling upon god should we not succeed in their defense but this is done for those who have departed in the faith while even the catechumens are not reckoned as worthy of this consolation but are deprived of every means of assistance except one and what is that we may give alms to the poor on their behalf
9214776 there is an ecclesiastical discipline as the faithful know when the names of the martyrs are read aloud in that place at the altar of god
9214777 but by the prayers of the holy church and by the salvific sacrifice and by the alms which are given for their spirits there is no doubt that the dead are aided that the lord might deal more mercifully with them than their sins would deserve the whole church observes this practice which was handed down by the fathers that it prays for those who have died in the communion of the body and blood of christ when they are commemorated in their own place in the sacrifice itself and the sacrifice is offered also in memory of them on their behalf if then works of mercy are celebrated for the sake of those who are being remembered who would hesitate to recommend them on whose behalf prayers to god are not offered in vain it is not at all to be doubted that such prayers are of profit to the dead but for such of them as lived before their death in a way that makes it possible for these things to be useful to them after death temporal punishments are suffered by some in this life only by some after death by some both here and hereafter but all of them before that last and strictest judgment but not all who suffer temporal punishments after death will come to eternal punishments which are to follow after that judgment
9214778 the time which interposes between the death of a man and the final resurrection holds souls in hidden retreats accordingly as each is deserving of rest or of hardship in view of what it merited when it was living in the flesh nor can it be denied that the souls of the dead find relief through the piety of their friends and relatives who are still alive when the sacrifice of the mediator mass is offered for them or when alms are given in the church but these things are of profit to those who when they were alive merited that they might afterward be able to be helped by these things there is a certain manner of living neither so good that there is no need of these helps after death nor yet so wicked that these helps are of no avail after death
9214779 we also purpose to develope taekwondo culture as an international military arts
9214780 i had a gal and her name was sal 15 miles on the erie canal

9214786 ent o trate de parar de diminuir o que multivac fez por n s
9214787 e quem disse que n o fez o que estou dizendo que o sol n o vai durar para sempre isso tudo que estou dizendo n s estamos seguros por dez bilh es de anos mas e depois
9214788 e n o venha me dizer que n s iremos trocar de sol
9214789 voc est pensando que iremos conseguir outro sol quando o nosso estiver acabado n o est
9214790 claro que est voc fraco em l gica esse o seu problema como o personagem da hist ria que quando surpreendido por uma chuva corre para um grupo de rvores e abriga se embaixo de uma ele n o se preocupa porque quando uma rvore fica molhada demais simplesmente vai para baixo de outra
9214791 n o precisa gritar quando o sol se for as outras estrelas tamb m ter o se acabado
9214792 tudo teve in cio na explos o c smica original o que quer que tenha sido e tudo ter um fim quando as estrelas se apagarem algumas se apagam mais r pido que as outras ora as gigantes n o duram cem milh es de anos o sol ir brilhar por dez bilh es de anos e talvez as an s permane am assim por duzentos bilh es mas nos d um trilh o de anos e s restar a escurid o a entropia deve aumentar ao seu m ximo e tudo
9214793 ent o voc sabe que um dia tudo ter um fim
9214794 voc disse seu tonto voc disse que n s t nhamos toda a energia de que precis vamos para sempre voc disse para sempre
9214795 talvez n s possamos reconstruir as coisas de volta um dia
9214796 voc pergunta a multivac eu te desafio aposto cinco d lares que isso n o pode ser feito
9214797 n s chegamos em x 23 n s chegamos em x 23
9214798 n o tem jeito ainda n o me acostumei com a id ia de deixar a terra

9214802 a migra o vai terminar um dia mas n o antes de bilh es de anos muitos bilh es at as estrelas t m um fim voc sabe a entropia precisa aumentar
9214803 entropia meu bem uma palavra para o n vel de desgaste do universo tudo se gasta e acaba foi assim que aconteceu com o seu robozinho de controle remoto lembra
9214804 voc n o pode colocar pilhas novas como em meu rob

9214806 n o deixe papai n o deixe que as estrelas se apaguem
9214807 bem bem meus anjinhos vou perguntar a microvac n o se preocupem ele vai nos ajudar
9214808 viram microvac disse que ir cuidar de tudo quando a hora chegar ent o n o h porque se preocupar
9214809 e agora crian as hora de ir para a cama em breve n s estaremos em nosso novo lar
9214810 me pergunto se n o rid culo nos preocuparmos tanto com esta quest o
9214811 creio que n o no presente ritmo de expans o voc sabe que a gal xia estar completamente tomada dentro de cinco anos
9214812 hesitei em enviar um relat rio pessimista ao conselho gal ctico

9214814 o espa o infinito cem bilh es de gal xias est o a nossa espera talvez mais
9214815 cem bilh es n o o infinito e est ficando menos ainda a cada segundo
9214816 muito bem a imortalidade existe e n s devemos lev la em conta admito que ela tenha o seu lado negativo o ac gal ctico j solucionou muitos problemas mas ao fornecer a resposta sobre como impedir o envelhecimento e a morte sobrepujou todas as outras conquistas
9214817 no entanto suponho que voc n o gostaria de abandonar a vida
9214818 ainda n o eu n o estou velho o bastante voc tem quantos anos
9214819 al m disso h um problema de transporte eu me pergunto quantas unidades de energia solar ser o necess rias para movimentar as popula es de uma gal xia para outra
9214820 boa quest o no presente momento a humanidade consome duas unidades de energia solar por ano
9214821 da qual a maior parte desperdi ada afinal nossa gal xia sozinha produz mil unidades de energia solar por ano e n s aproveitamos apenas duas
9214822 certo mas mesmo com 100 de efici ncia podemos apenas adiar o fim nossa demanda energ tica tem crescido em progress o geom trica de maneira ainda mais acelerada do que a popula o ficaremos sem energia antes mesmo que nos faltem gal xias uma boa quest o de fato uma tima quest o
9214823 n s precisaremos construir novas estrelas a partir do g s interestelar
9214824 pode haver algum jeito de reverter a entropia n s dev amos perguntar ao ac gal ctico
9214825 algo que a ra a humana ter de enfrentar um dia
9214826 oh eu n o queria que voc realmente fizesse essa pergunta
9214827 n s dois sabemos que a entropia n o pode ser revertida voc n o pode construir uma rvore de volta a partir de fuma a e cinzas
9214828 n s a chamamos apenas de gal xia e voc
9214829 n s tamb m todos os homens chamam as suas gal xias de gal xias n o

9214837 sim mas quando toda a energia acabar nossos corpos ir o finalmente morrer e voc e eu partiremos junto com eles
9214838 n o quero que isso aconte a nem em bilh es de anos ac universal como a morte das estrelas pode ser evitada
9214839 voc perguntou se h como reverter a dire o da entropia
9214840 ainda n o h dados suficientes para uma resposta significativa
9214841 cuidadosamente controlada pelo ac c smico a energia que resta em todo o universo ainda vai durar por um bilh o de anos
9214842 ainda assim vai eventualmente acabar por mais que possa ser poupada uma vez gasta n o h como recuper la a entropia precisa aumentar ao seu m ximo
9214843 pode a entropia ser revertida vamos perguntar ao ac c smico
9214844 ainda n o h dados suficientes para uma resposta significativa
9214845 eu o farei tenho feito isso por cem bilh es de anos meus predescessores e eu ouvimos esta pergunta muitas vezes mas os dados que tenho permanecem insuficientes

9214915 the disappointing thing was the way we started the game the first 25 minutes was so unlike us as we made it so easy for hearts and conceded a soft goal
9214916 but after that i thought we came right back into the game
9214917 we played three up front but the three did not do enough and ive told them that in the dressing room
9214918 richard offiong had a chance late on and unfortunately he slipped and nicked his hamstring
9214919 we were a bit naive at times and hearts probably shaded the game but if you ask me who were the better football team then i would say us
9214920 it is not easy playing against a team who have just come up from the first division
9214921 i must compliment hamilton as they are a young team with good spirit but we had more of the game and played good football
9214922 our fans must understand that we have a very young squad without experience but it was a fantastic afternoon for us
9214923 layrea kingston was a big personality in the game and andrew driver sometimes does not realise how much talent he has
9214924 we should have won the game we had three or four really good chances and just one mistake at the end of the first half has punished us
9214925 i thought garry brady was the best player on the park a real assured performance against quality opposition
9214926 at half time we are scratching our heads and wondering how we have gone in one down with the dominance that we had
9214927 i think the manner which were playing is exciting weve just got to cut out individual mistakes and keep playing with the belief and confidence we have been showing
9214928 i thought we started very well and were knocking it about but then we started to get sloppy
9214929 it was a mistake by them and weve got a break at a very important time
9214930 second half we had so many chances to put it bed and we didnt guss team worked their socks off and garry brady did really well for them in midfield
9214931 but we got the result and its another clean sheet away from home thats us got seven points from four games now in difficult matches
9214932 i feel that bobby olejnik kept us in the game but i cant ask any more of them they gave me everything theyve got
9214933 i need to get three or four back from injury and then you can judge us but the boys that are in there i cant ask any more than they are giving me
9214934 if you look at the two goals that we lost its not that anyone is carving us open i think were soft and a really poor side in terms of going to head the ball and going into tackles
9214935 once we get guys back like burton obrien and stevie lovell then well be okay weve got walking wounded like jackie mcnamara and kevin mcbride and were down to brass tacks
9214936 i was delighted with the performance from start to finish i think that it could have been three or four to us at half time and we had energy tempo everything
9214937 sometimes when you start the game so well you get the joy and after their goal went in our heads didnt go down and we got our just rewards in the end
9214938 dougie imrie was disappointed not to be in the starting line up but i saw that smile before he went on and thats what hes all about
9214939 thats the type of ball where he goes driving at defences and him and barry wilson coming on give us that option in the wide areas it was a super finish from dougie

9214944 you dont have the ability to centralize production of resources because the landscape doesnt lend itself to that
9214945 this this performance is what i expect from the team but were only about 60 70 per cent of where we want to be
9214946 but an opportunity for the players to showcase their talents
9214947 when the guys put it together somebody would get a beating
9214948 there has been plenty of criticism but it shows that the process is now beginning to work
9214949 we will rather focus on what is a great opportunity for us
9214950 for me to be included im pleased my main focus is to enjoy my cricket as i know i dont have a lot of time left
9214951 the presence of arab forces on the ground can help in preventing the fighting and stopping the israeli palestinian conflict
9214952 the matter has not been studied yet but it is an attractive idea that deserves to be taken seriously when we consider that egypt and the arab league may play a role in this matter
9214953 were going to be very competitive the expectation is were going to be in every game and well see what happens
9214954 everybody wants to take a magic pill and get a big name
9214955 if we lose five cornerbacks maybe well make some calls but this is who were going with
9214956 hes not the first and wont be the last third rounder released from his original team
9214957 theres been a lot written and said about this third receiver but our third receiver last year tim carter caught eight balls last year
9214958 its not that important when steve heidens in and kellens like a third receiver when you only have 53 players youre going to be a little light in some places
9214959 this is prompted by the fact that one in four children in british columbia is either overweight or obese
9214960 we actually know that children who are healthy actually learn better
9214961 we really hope the physical break is about how the teachers shape their classes
9214962 weve created a series of guidelines that actually outline the types of products that can be in a vending machine
9214963 it doesnt mean that a student couldnt have pizza its just a matter of whats on that pizza
9214964 absolutely teachers are behind that but that revenue was funding sports teams special events and in some cases text books and basic supplies
9214965 you cant add p e in schools without adding space for that and resources for that
9214966 we dont have the gym space in vancouver it rains a lot and you cant have kids out there on the field in the pouring rain and in many parts of the province its very cold in the winter
9214967 fundamentally you need to have classrooms that are going to be as effective as possible
9214968 we continue to struggle to convince the government to address resources there
9214969 the acquisition and signing of andrej is a strong statement to our players and our fans that the lightning ownership group is committed to putting the best product on the ice now and for years to come
9214970 im extremely happy to be heading to tampa bay and i cant wait to take advantage of this opportunity we should have a great team and i can not wait to get started
9214971 it should be stressed that antenatal screening is safe and effective
9214972 this exercise only involved a very small number of patients all of whom we have contacted directly
9214973 there is no need to be concerned if you have not been contacted
9214974 we understand the frustration but we have no power to go into a private property and start digging up the floor
9214975 we are supplying them with a list of preferred contractors and plumbers
9214976 they saw that all seven houses had no pressure and they heard the massive roaring leak below the ground and walked away telling us all to call a plumber as it was not their problem
9214977 we cant have a shower or run the washing machine or anything like that
9214978 the water board said i suggest you call a plumber but its not on our property
9214979 meanwhile we can hear thousands of gallons of water roaring down the street its very worrying
9214980 man what a session we had a fantastic car and im happy we go the pole
9214981 all were worried about now is getting one more point than helio so far so good but we have a long way to go
9214982 there have been plenty of highs and lows in my career and its been an honour to wear the springbok jersey but it is time to go
9214983 with the new laws and a new era in front of us with the way rugby is played and with a new coach peter de villiers it is the right time
9214984 i have had many memorable moments in a springbok jersey and it has been a privilege to play for my country and to go around the world playing against so many great players of other countries
9214985 i want to thank de villiers gary gold and dick muir the assistant boks coaches and the selectors for recalling me to the side after the world cup last year
9214986 its kind of the way i got started in politics and you are concerned about the issues in the community
9214987 she is as about far from washington d c not only geographically but in regard to what goes on in d c the politics as usual
9214988 all these candidates talk about the middle income america and the working families she is from the working families
9214989 the obama camp did not even consider the most powerful political woman in the country as a presidential possibility and i think a lot of hillary clinton supporters now have a place to go
9214990 there was talk the other night about hillary clinton almost breaking the glass ceiling well it is the republicans who are actually breaking it
9214991 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9214992 the permafrost now has small holes we have found elevated levels of methane above the water surface and even more in the water just below it is obvious that the source is the seabed

9215011 it would have been nice to have got past him and played
9215012 as opposed to 12 months ago i feel like im a much better player with my results and hopefully i can keep going in the right direction its all a step forward i won one match here which was good but i was disappointed to lose today
9215013 it was close he won the crucial points and played too good at certain stages
9215014 its a challenge not just for australian rugby union but also the
9215015 theyre experiencing the player drain as well with dan carter going for a short stint at perpignon in the south of france and then returning to make himself available for the world cup
9215016 its probably something theyre going to have to look at seriously moving forward the players might be feeling stale and that opportunity to play and travel might re energise them to have one more campaign before they retire
9215017 without that change in stimulus they might not continue playing
9215018 if they feel that theyre better than someone coming across from rugby league they should try and prove that
9215019 the winners get it all the runners up get nothing
9215020 those who are runners up will never watch the game or talk about it they dont see it as an achievement to win through to the last two they cop it from all angles
9215021 i know how it is for people who feel the pressure in finals because ive been there
9215022 i was a pretty experienced player so it can hit anyone it happened to me with my first kick for goal in the 95 grand final i missed it and it went out of bounds
9215023 i knew it was probably my last chance at a flag so the pressure was on fortunately i was able to turn it around
9215024 i dont know why it was the case but i just seemed to be able to perform to my best when it counted
9215025 sitting on the interchange bench for a couple of quarters in a grand final doesnt exactly give you a good feeling
9215026 you feel helpless you feel hopeless the day that started out offering so much has turned out to be a nightmare
9215027 sometimes it is very much about the smell of blood and when you see you have an opponent down you dont want to show any reason not to keep him down
9215028 yabby used to say once your career is finished you need to make sure you can look at that guy in the mirror every morning and if he smiles back at you then you are pretty satisfied with your career
9215029 my philosophy back then was that you want to not only show the public but also your own indigenous people that you can play well on footballs biggest stage
9215030 the focus was wanting to play well for your team and your family but you were also playing for your people
9215031 i am not sure it is purely an indigenous thing i think it comes back to attitude and the ability to go out and win your own ball
9215032 but it is fair to say that the indigenous players i played with particularly michael long and gavin wanganeen didnt sit back and wait for anyone they just wanted to get out have a go and try their heart out that attitude seems to work in finals
9215033 you dont think too much about it at the time but to play well in finals is something you look back on with a bit of pride
9215034 gary ablett is an amazing player luke hodge looks set for a big september he is fit and firing at the right time i am really looking forward to seeing how adam cooney handles the pressure leon davis and dale thomas seem to like performing on the big stage
9215035 playing in a final is a moment and if you let that moment get to you you are rarely capable of putting in your best effort
9215036 im a big fan of darren milburn matty scarlett gary ablett and cameron mooney i just go to the footy to watch buddy franklin sam mitchell and luke hodge are in and under players the dogs have hard runners in daniel cross and matty boyd
9215037 you do everything you can to win but it really hurts when you dont it stays with you too
9215038 geelong has some great players but i would love to see the hawks do well this year buddy franklin is great to watch and can just about do anything id also like to see my nephew cyril rioli perform well
9215039 the pressure of a grand final can do funny things to people it got to me early in the 95 match
9215040 i love watching jimmy bartel and gary ablett everyone loves buddy but im a sam mitchell man hes a serious midfielder whos done it the hard way
9215041 sheeds message was always to go out and get the ball as soon as possible put it on your boot and get some confidence nice and early
9215042 the geelong players have already stamped themselves as big game players
9215043 i never felt nervous going into finals i looked forward to the contest but there was no doubt some players did suffer losing can be a noose around your neck
9215044 joel corey loves the contest i would be very surprised if buddy franklin doesnt have a big finals series this year nick riewoldt has lifted the saints into the finals with a great second half of the year daniel cross plays at a high level
9215045 playing to the best of your ability in the matches that matter is so important not only to the team but yourself if you dont you wont last long in the game
9215046 andrew has nothing to say hes not doing any media interviews
9215047 we have focused on a duty of care for andrew and we are concerned about his mental welfare he had a long and demanding summer
9215048 if you dont fulfil those unfortunately you are not going to be on our squad you need to be committed 100 per cent
9215049 i hope he goes away from this and gets himself right and gets himself back into our team because he is a very important player and we certainly want him as a part of our squad
9215050 he caught some good barra and was going to take out some of the boys from the cricket team next week
9215051 hes got to reassess where hes at if hes doing these things its not the first time
9215052 aa president rob fildes and i actually sat with his mother and his manager in the stands at the birds nest stadium during the meet
9215053 wed love to get him out during february next year and it would be great to get him to a game of cricket
9215054 his dream is to meet matty hayden and with the push for twenty20 cricket to be added to the olympics we would love to be able to introduce him to a packed mcg twenty20 crowd
9215055 it was one one hundredth quicker than she ran in beijing so were both happy with that
9215056 but that will come shes only a baby in terms of hurdling lolos beatable
9215057 weve got players who can play in any position and i really think theres a good mix
9215058 were not getting carried away but this team is definitely right up there with the one that won the premiership
9215059 i hadnt played with fabiano before but it felt like hed been there for years and weve got a great understanding already
9215060 i knew at some stage i would come on but i didnt think it would be so early
9215061 ernies always stressed to us that he wants to play attacking football ive pulled up a little bit sore but im feeling ok

9215091 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9215092 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9215093 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9215094 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9215095 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9215096 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9215097 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
9215098 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
9215099 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
9215100 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9215101 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9215102 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9215103 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9215104 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9215105 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9215106 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9215107 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9215108 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9215109 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9215110 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9215111 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9215112 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9215113 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9215114 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9215115 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9215116 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9215117 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9215118 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9215119 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9215120 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9215121 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9215122 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9215123 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9215124 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9215125 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9215126 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9215127 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9215128 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9215129 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9215130 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9215131 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9215132 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9215133 we gave him an opportunity to speak to wolves that hes taken up as far as we know hes not signed for them
9215134 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9215135 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9215136 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9215137 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9215138 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9215139 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9215140 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9215141 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9215142 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9215143 ya saya minta maaf ya kami ajk akan tiba sebentar lagi harap boleh tunggu ye di sana

9215146 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9215147 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9215148 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9215149 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9215150 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9215151 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9215152 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9215153 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9215154 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9215155 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9215156 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9215157 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9215158 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9215159 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9215160 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9215161 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9215162 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9215163 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9215164 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9215165 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9215166 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9215167 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9215168 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9215169 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9215170 they want us to reward them for the last 8 years with four more years
9215171 on the 2 great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he mccain still embraces their extreme philosophy
9215172 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
9215173 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
9215174 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
9215175 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
9215176 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9215177 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9215178 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9215179 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9215180 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9215181 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9215182 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9215183 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9215184 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

9215198 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9215199 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9215200 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9215201 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9215202 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9215203 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9215204 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9215205 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9215206 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9215207 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9215208 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop

9215210 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9215211 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9215212 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9215213 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9215214 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9215215 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9215216 you are not going to air a story about this
9215217 of the 33 per cent girls who honestly admitted to being sexually active 76 per cent are using contraceptives the dependence on condoms is 33 per cent
9215218 they spend a lot of time commuting or working and we would like to use that dead time to enable them to access services such as this one
9215219 we want to tap into the smaller towns and cities where our customers may not have access to the internet but can upload profiles using a preloaded application
9215220 of course the parents want to be involved in the process but they are also open to using newer platforms such as mobiles to scout for their soul mate
9215221 i would like to hunt for my ideal partner but wheres the time this way i can look for him while i am travelling or working

9215249 estamos haciendo cambios muy importantes en educaci n y se ve que hay algunos sectores que est n reaccionando negativamente yo entiendo que se pudieron cometer errores los estamos reparando pero me parece que lo que est jugando ac es si se puede tomar o no una escuela si la pol tica educativa que nosotros estamos llevando adelante es la correcta o no
9215250 lo que nos est n reclamando es que les demos a todos ac no nos est n reclamando que seamos eficaces a la hora de decir a qui n se le otorga sino a todos y nosotros las estamos dando s lo a los que m s lo necesitan
9215251 las estamos dando solo a los que m s lo necesitan en t rminos presupuestarios no hay ninguna reducci n
9215252 ahora hay una evaluaci n seria por parte del estado y hay muchos chicos que llenaron mal este formulario probablemente haya errores tanto en la confecci n del formulario como en procedimiento por parte del ministerio
9215253 a m me conviene pol ticamente repartir becas como se hac a antes la plata es la misma yo no ahorro en esto al contrario vamos a gastar m s de lo que estaba planteado
9215254 ac no hay ajuste presupuestario ac hay un cambio de criterio lo que hicimos fue duplicar triplicar y hasta cuadriplicar el monto de las becas que sigue siendo muy bajo igual y d rselo a los que m s lo necesitan

9215260 sarah palins chief qualification for being elected governor was that she was not frank murkowski
9215261 she was not elected because she was a conservative she was not elected because of her grasp of issues or because of her track record as the mayor of wasilla
9215262 i served with hillary clinton i know hillary clinton hillary clinton is a friend of mine you sarah palin are no hillary clinton
9215263 if you are going to go after barack obama on experience this pick makes no sense
9215264 we just dont know how shell handle the next nine weeks of campaigning dealing with all these complicated national and international issues debating obamas running mate joe biden and having every word scrutinized by an aggressive press corps
9215265 her record as a reformer and maverick is very helpful but how can she prep on so many national and international issues she hurts the ticket because now the experience argument is weaker
9215266 the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day
9215267 as for that vp talk all the time i tell ya i still cant answer that question until until somebody answers for me what it is exactly that the vice president does every day

9215269 wtwc is insightful and clever with a terrific team of writers i highly recommend it
9215270 we learned a lot in our two matches this weekend
9215271 our defense has been outstanding this weekend and i think that our offense has gotten better our attacking still has some room to improve we knew that since our match tonight was going to be cancelled we wanted to be sure to come out this morning and keep our focus and maintain our intensity
9215272 she is the type of player who is going to keep improving with every match we are asking a lot of her and she is responding by performing very well on the court
9215273 she is all over the court and doesnt let anything hit the ground there is a reason why she was the state mvp last season as a high school senior allison is the type of player who makes the whole team better she is very consistent and seems to dig every ball
9215274 it was a massive game it sounds funny only three matches into a new season but the pressure was on us and we were feeling it
9215275 when jamie was sent off i felt we were on top i was disappointed for him he was maybe a bit silly

9215279 our architect destefano amp partners out of chicago is an expert at creating mixed use buildings that blend completely with their surroundings
9215280 the architecture will be a beautiful and distinctive addition to the clayton skyline plus we anticipate leed certification from the u s green building council
9215281 our building is directly across the street from the forsyth metrolink station
9215282 we believe our price points appeal to discriminating buyers in every price range
9215283 we have 50 units already under contract and only a few remain at pre construction pricing with the groundbreaking scheduled this year and move in predicted in 2010 residents have ample time to sell their existing home or finish graduate school

9215288 if you dont like the way im driving blah blah
9215289 but at least in the short term it will shake up the race and leave some asking why senator obama didnt pick senator clinton to be his veep
9215290 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9215291 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9215292 without hillary being the nominee its really quite equally as important
9215293 there are a lot of women who are disaffected by how hillary was treated by the media by how she was treated by the obama campaign not speaking up when sexism raised its ugly head in the media

9215306 i am confident and positive that the city will arrange a good place
9215307 my last 24 hours have been somewhat worrisome and very very prayerful because this is a very serious threat and its a lot of people to get to safe ground or be safe where they are

9215322 es gibt computerspiele die inhaltlich bers ziel hinausschie en und gewalt verherrlichen
9215323 interessanter w re es diese beispiele der breiten masse an spielen gegen berzustellen die das nicht machen
9215324 wenn world of warcraft elf euro im monat kostet dann haben diejenigen die es vermarkten ein massives interesse dass sie niemanden verlieren deshalb konstruieren sie ihr spiel so dass die leute dranbleiben und man muss sagen dass gelingt ihnen sehr gut
9215325 vor den klausuren ist es nat rlich immer so dass ich zwei wochen lang nicht mehr spiele und stattdessen lerne
9215326 aber normalerweise habe ich w hrend der woche genug zeit um zu spielen auch neben der uni
9215327 es macht spa und ist mein hobby ich habe derzeit keinen job und daher spiele ich den ganzen tag
9215328 das sind so zw lf stunden computerspielen ist sehr wichtig in meinem leben
9215329 machen wir uns nichts vor welche eltern freuen sich nicht wenn aus dem kinderzimmer keine ger usche kommen und sich die kinder f nf sechs stunden besch ftigen
9215330 deshalb muss man solange es geht versuchen die kinder oder auch jugendlichen zu erziehen
9215331 wir suchen schon w hrend des entwicklungsprozesses den kontakt zum jugendschutz ich denke das ist ganz wichtig
9215332 in china verbringen viele junge menschen viele studenten ihre zeit in internet caf s spielen ist ihre hauptbesch ftigung
9215333 deswegen hat die regierung im letzten jahr eine verordnung erlassen die bewirkt dass jeder der unter 18 jahren alt ist und mehr als drei stunden online spielt nur halb so viel gold oder erfahrungspunkte im spiel sammelt wenn sie mehr als f nf stunden spielen dann bekommen sie sogar gar nichts
9215334 es war der geeignete augenblick nach der reflexionspause des sommers und einigem gedankenaustausch
9215335 jetzt werde ich mit allen arbeiten ohne eine einzige ausnahme
9215336 ich denke meine aufgabe ist es all die die dasselbe denken in der sozialistischen partei zusammen zu bringen damit sie einen festen zentralen block bilden der eine richtung weist

9215339 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9215340 we were walking to the car when we were stopped in our tracks
9215341 there was a strange smell in the air it was very hard to describe it made us lift our heads up so we were facing a drystane dyke just a few feet away i couldnt believe what i saw
9215342 it was black and looked like a puma it was amazing to see its strength and agility when it leaped over the wall and away from us
9215343 i know we were very lucky to see what we had seen
9215344 we had only been drinking cups of tea that night
9215345 but i wouldnt want to get too close to it
9215346 i think its important that farmers know this thing is out and about theyre going to have to be extra vigilant to protect their livestock
9215347 the cat we saw looked very healthy so its obviously feeding well on something
9215348 the rural north east of scotland is an ideal habitat for these big cats theres plenty of deer and rabbits up there for them to live off
9215349 the trouble is nobody is really sure what this creature is if it was black then it was more likely to be a leopard not a puma what we are keen to do is set up a webcam in the area where there have been a number of sightings
9215350 people will be able to use their computers to help spot these animals

9215357 these are centuries old traditions and i will continue to defend them
9215358 only those who indulge in immoral acts should be afraid
9215359 there is absolutely no law that i know of that makes a black and white determination that a nudist colony is bad for a child
9215360 if there is any concerns about any situation we always err on the side of the safety and well being of the child
9215361 the courts put a lot of stock on personal opinion of that case worker and their personal bias frequently play a huge part on what they say
9215362 violence is for those who have lost their imagination has your country lost its imagination
9215363 ministry would for all that not an illusion in no case happened
9215364 we trained very hard but it seemed that every time we were beginning to form up into teams we would be reorganised i was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganising it can be a wonderful method of creating the illusion of progress while creating confusion inefficiency and demoralisation
9215365 ministry would for all that not an illusion in no case happened
9215366 who check in with the student at regular intervals to help answer questions set goals and provide feedback
9215367 we knew we had the speed on them but we didnt think our drives would go that quickly
9215368 our coaches did a great job preparing all week and we executed vernon caldwell played great at quarterback for us and our defense beat them at the point of attack and stopped their power game
9215369 i was just focused on giving my daddy a good birthday today

9215374 if you have seen the picture of a drowning bear recently which was distributed with the
9215375 but we know our efforts will take more than protecting what we have we must also learn what we dont know thats why state biologists are studying the health of polar bear populations and their habitat
9215376 these studies are meant to inform the us fish and wildlife service about listing the polar bear as endangered after careful examination my co authors and i were unable to find any references to works providing evidence that the forecasting methods used in the reports had been previously validated in essence they give no scientific basis for deciding one way or the other about the polar bear
9215377 if they want to maintain tradition then hunt with the tools used before modern technology came along
9215378 since endorsing falwells liberty u mccain hasnt had any sound judgement
9215379 i know theyre cute and cuddly but this unwelcome fact if you meet a hungry polar bear youll end up polar scat
9215380 sarah palin just wnats to keep the polar bear off the list so she can drill for oil in anwr you people need to wake up and see that the oil men in the white house are robbing this country for everything we have and blah bla blah i cant believe how dumb we as americans have become

9215385 krishnakumarji as he was affectionately known was an acute observer of national and international events and made important though discreet contributions to public policy including economic policy i offer my tribute to the memory of an outstanding social engineer an innovative newspaper owner and industrialist
9215386 he has been the kind of person that legends are made of his passing way is a loss not only to industry but the whole nation
9215387 k k birla served the nation with distinction during his many years in public life he made valuable contributions for the industrialisation and economic development of the country in his death the country has lost an eminent and multifaceted pubic personality who shall always be remembered
9215388 birla was not only a noted industrialist but a well known public figure in the country his efforts for promotion of technical education and hindi literature in the country received wide acclaim he set up the k k birla foundation for the promotion of hindi literature
9215389 with the death of k k birla a strong pillar of indian industry has fallen a dedicated hard working and sincere industrialist has left us the religious and social institutions established by him are a living example of his social commitment
9215390 k k birlas demise is a great loss to india and indian industry through his visionary leadership and hard work birla had established a business conglomerate spanning industries like sugar fertilizers chemicals heavy engineering textiles shipping and media

9215397 non era facile ma la partita si messa subito sui binari giusti e stata combattuta anche perch i ragazzi avevano un po paura dopo le sconfitte subite in precampionato loro hanno avuto qualche opportunit ma noi non abbiamo commesso disattenzioni nel primo tempo ho preferito giocare con la difesa a quattro nella ripresa ho decentrato isla per coprire la fascia destra dove loro agivano in tre i gol di di natale mi hanno ricordato quelli con la reggina ma avevo fiducia in tutta la squadra non ho mai avuto dubbi a riguardo nemmeno quando lo hanno fatto gli altri non siamo ancora al 100 ma ovvio in questo momento come lo anche per gli altri
9215398 e merito di tutti questi ragazzi che voglio ringraziare se ho fatto bene sono rimasto a udine perch la famiglia pozzo mi ha dato la possibilit di stare bene e io qui sto veramente bene stiamo lavorando sodo purtroppo tanti ragazzi sono arrivati in ritardo in ritiro per gli impegni con le nazionali prima di tutto pensiamo ad ottenere i 40 punti per la salvezza questanno abbiamo anche la uefa e la coppa italia perci dobbiamo dosare le forze chi consiglierei a lippi per la nazionale in squadra ci sono anti ragazzi bravi e sono convinto che alla fine possano arrivare in azzurro anche altri miei compagni
9215399 sono veramente soddisfatto perch ho visto la prestazione che volevo vedere da parte dei miei la vittoria alla prima giornata conta tanto soprattutto se si supera una squadra forte come il cittadella e uniniezione di fiducia che ci permette di crescere il mercato visto che linfortunio di mengoni una cosa lunga serve un uomo che vada ad aiutarci in difesa il caso riccio per me non mai stato un problema e mai lo sar e il capitano un giocatore importante la societ sa quanto importante per noi
9215400 era importante partire subito bene e ci siamo riusciti meglio il primo tempo del secondo in una partita di novanta minuti si gioca in due normale che anche gli avversari costruiscano palle gol nella ripresa il cittadella ci ha messo alle corde grazie alla sua velocit il gol simile a quello della scorsa stagione con lavellino sempre di testa e nella stessa porta sono ovviamente soddisfatto per la rete dei tre punti la dedico alla mia famiglia limportante comunque era che il piacenza conquistasse il successo
9215401 ci fa molto piacere aver regalato questa vittoria ai nostri tifosi fantastici oggi non era facile esprimerci al meglio faceva molto caldo e abbiamo accusato un calo durante il match limportante era partire con il piede giusto abbiamo creato diverse palle gol e normale soffrire quando non si riesce a trovare subito il raddoppio il gruppo ha mostrato grande carattere e personalit obiettivi presto per parlarne dice il tecnico godiamoci questa vittoria e da luned cominceremo a pensare al cittadella il mercato sono soddisfatto cos se arriver qualcosaltro sar tutto guadagnato
9215402 abbiamo sofferto tanto ma alla fine siamo stati bravi a portare in porto il risultato sono contento per la fiducia che mi ha accordato la societ io continuo a giocare con il massimo impegno per la salernitana
9215403 se giochiamo con la stessa grinta e umilt messi in campo oggi dice il bomber potremo fare grandi cose se ci montiamo la testa non andremo lontano lintesa con fava e con scarpa migliora di giorno in giorno oggi era importante vincere per regalare ai nostri straordinari tifosi questa vittoria
9215404 torniamo a casa amareggiati ma consapevoli di aver fatto una buona gara i complimenti li faccio al portiere granata che ha fatto delle grandi parate pur non essendo brillanti sotto il profilo atletico abbiamo creato molte occasioni da gol probabilmente il pareggio era il risultato pi giusto
9215405 during general musharrafs time the problem was that the presidency was being used as a party office of the pml q if mr zardari remains as the leader of the ppp there are fears that once again the presidents house will become an extension of the ppp will the ppp declare that he will quit his party office the dignity of the office can only be restored by a non partisan president
9215406 it will be inappropriate to invite the company to tamil nadu now tatas also have not approached us for permission
9215407 it is not as if it has additional power and is denying it to us you cannot say that tamil nadu is facing power crisis this year the situation was no different last year
9215408 i did not say anything to him in this regard
9215409 what i want you to do is to go to my website listed below
9215410 what i want you to do is to go to my website listed below
9215411 we have always made this point that testing is a word that we find difficult to adjust with so we will find ways around it
9215412 definitely we dont want ourselves to be singled out for this if any country does not wish to give us enrichment and reprocessing technologies and still wishes to have nuclear commerce well draw up our guidelines according to that what we dont want is each countrys individual predilections forming a huge package of items in the nsg exemptions
9215413 i had chances i was fighting i wanted so much to win but she played unbelievable
9215414 our vehicles were seized and employees beaten up and no one was allowed to distribute the paper
9215415 i think the situation is is far less serious than what is being portrayed but at the same time certainly something that we are very unhappy about
9215416 i mean people have started comparing it with the 1990s and what not certainly the situation is nowhere around that
9215417 what is causing us concern is that four years of improvement in the situation we believed that we have reduced levels of alienation there were substantial signs of normalcy in the state people had forgotten about issues
9215418 relaxation of various kinds and various purposes so normalcy should be round the corner
9215419 we are hopeful that this could be achieved in the next one week to 10 days
9215420 a captain can only do a few things he cant do everything on his own
9215421 in a way he identifies the problem areas and shares the responsibility i firmly believe a good team makes a good captain and not the other way round of course as captain you have to keep the team united motivated and get them to work in the right direction
9215422 if people like sachin and sehwag are part of the team it really helps
9215423 but thats not in our control there is no point sitting and sulking about people who arent there because it doesnt make a difference the 15 guys who are here are the ones that matter its up to the individuals to take responsibility happily they are doing that but you do miss the great players
9215424 not just twenty20 even 50 over cricket is very demanding you want batsmen who run well and quickly between the wickets who put pressure on the opposition if you make a par score on a ground and you are a good fielding side that throws itself around and converts half chances it contributes because suddenly the total appears 15 20 runs more
9215425 you must give players a long run to prove themselves everyone wants to play international cricket but the best way to improve your skills is to practice out in the middle
9215426 sometimes when you want to prove yourself you are desperate to perform and that desperation bogs you down you play at your best when you are relaxed
9215427 then even if he fails he knows what he needs to work on and he can go back and play first class cricket and fight for a recall
9215428 the land which was taken away by the government by virtue of a cabinet order should be restored
9215429 no formula was given to us so the question of rejection or accepting it does not arise
9215430 the ldf has left it to the cabinet to decide on the exact rate of tariff hike but has insisted that it should not place a heavy burden on the ordinary people
9215431 i would have at least pursued an mba as per my parents wishes but this letter made me choose a job over higher education now i really do not know what to do
9215432 it companies have been recruiting from campuses above the required numbers when the actual time of appointment arrives they find that the actual number required is lower so they either tell the selected recruits to wait or find alternative options companies are not entirely to be blamed colleges often pressure companies into conducting drives in their campuses to attract admissions for the next year once the company gives a letter of intent to selected candidates the college authorities wash their hands of them

9215437 design thinking can offer greater deeper and faster insight into users lives to help businesses know what to make in the first place
9215438 this whole thing is an experiment if it works well actually spend less than half of what it traditionally costs to acquire subscribers the success of this campaign will allow us to a meet a self selecting group of quality subscribers who find us through word of mouth internet links media coverage our partner organizations or the other crazy schemes we like to come up with b raise significant money for organizations that will do something important with it and c save resources and prove that you can do well by doing good
9215439 by engaging customers in conversation and probing customers with questions customers are very capable of stating the desired outcomes they are trying to achieve providing more insight than well tuned observational or anthropological techniques
9215440 experience economy work is theatre and every business a stage
9215441 what we sell is the ability for a 43 year old accountant to dress in black leather ride through small towns and have people be afraid of him
9215442 pare down to the essence but dont remove the poetry
9215443 i can give you five reasons off the top of my head why this isnt going to work
9215444 do you want to give me a bribe or do you want me to give you a traffic ticket
9215445 whosoever desires constant success must change his conduct with the times
9215446 should smes settle or not settle for the status quo
9215447 im pretty sure none of this would have happened if i hadnt been fired from apple it was awful tasting medicine but i guess the patient needed it sometimes lifes going to hit you in the head with a brick dont lose faith im convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that i loved what i did youve got to find what you love and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers your work is going to fill a large part of your life and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work and the only way to do great work is to love what you do
9215448 should a project program settle for an inappropriate innovation champion or not settle and keep on searching until they find an appropriate innovation champion
9215449 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed people can change the world indeed its the only thing that ever has
9215450 to settle on the mindset that only huge teams can embark on innovative projects or not settle for this kind of mindset and go off doing something incredible with a small passionate and dedicated team
9215451 it is as if he read the script he was given and that was a mistake he can change his attitude hes recoverable
9215452 if robinhos not here i have my players hes one more important player quality velocity many things but i have very very good players here
9215453 if peter doesnt buy robinho i have 23 who are here training and playing if we want one more player with quality peter tries to buy him if he doesnt come he doesnt come i have players for that position no problem
9215454 and the lord said unto abraham all that sarah saith unto thee thou shall do
9215455 i will keep you waiting outside in the blazing sun for 40 minutes
9215456 where did you say you are going oh you dont need a taxi its right up the road you can walk there in 5 minutes
9215457 if you had a car it would take you five minutes on foot it will take 25 minutes in the heat and well forget about the fact that you are in a hurry because you are seeing 8 tourist sites in one day ok
9215458 i hate us too we smell we are a nation of smelly rude people who leave their garbage behind to rot in the sun it is too hot and we smell gross tiberias is disgusting and i never want to come back here again
9215459 the whole country is like that right now the entire country really needs the kids to go back to school we are all just waiting for school to start
9215460 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9215461 sarah palins chief qualification for being elected governor was that she was not frank murkowski
9215462 she was not elected because she was a conservative she was not elected because of her grasp of issues or because of her track record as the mayor of wasilla
9215463 senator mccains choice for a running mate is beyond belief by choosing sarah palin mccain has clearly made a decision to continue the bush legacy of destructive environmental policies
9215464 sarah palin whose husband works for bp formerly british petroleum has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment
9215465 this is senator mccains first significant choice in building his executive team and its a bad one it has to raise serious doubts in the minds of voters about john mccains commitment to conservation to addressing the impacts of global warming and to ensuring our country ends its dependency on oil
9215466 i did find one thing quite interesting which is that alter insists that nobody listens to the gasbags and pundits so we shouldnt worry about them i asked him how he thought people got their information about politics and he said from their talkative coworker or politically engaged relative and things like chain emails

9215473 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me
9215474 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant

9215483 no one has showed up over here yet we have no idea who has the ticket
9215484 i think that uh you know campaigns start getting these uh hair triggers and uh the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9215485 wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming gov palin agrees with him and his policies
9215486 thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9215487 a screw up on the part of our research team
9215488 our supporters our staff get overzealous they start saying things that i would not say
9215489 it is my responsibility to make sure that were setting a clear tone in our campaign
9215490 you lifted each other up you covered for each other
9215491 you made up for each others mistakes you didnt blame each other when things went wrong
9215492 that if people were willing to submerge their egos and just focus on bringing their particular gifts and passion and energy and vision to a common task that great things can be accomplished
9215493 i ask my staff never to hand me paper until two seconds before i need it because i will lose it
9215494 ive got to have somebody around me who is keeping track of that stuff and thats not trivial i need to have good people in place who can make sure that systems run thats what ive always done and thats why we run not only a good campaign but a good
9215495 being president is not making sure that schedules are being run properly or the paperwork is being shuffled effectively it involves having a vision for where the country needs to go
9215496 staff had already scheduled some things and they couldnt wiggle out of it they heard from me a little bit because i wasnt happy i couldnt be there personally

9215498 we had some poor phrasing in the speech and we immediately tried to correct the interpretation that was given

9215504 we plan to start when were going to start and end when were going to end
9215505 being governor of a small state for less than two years is not consistent with the normal criteria for determining whos of presidential caliber
9215506 i think she is the most inexperienced person on a major party ticket in modern history
9215507 it would be one thing if she had only been governor for a year and a half but prior to that she had not had major experience in public life
9215508 the fact that he would have to go to somebody who is clearly unqualified to be president makes obama look like an elder statesman
9215509 not to belittle alaska but its different than the basket of issues you deal with in big dynamic states
9215510 if she had been around for two terms as governor or been a senator it would have been an incredible choice
9215511 who else could he have found who appealed to the conservative base and as someone who was a reformer
9215512 he took the wind out of perots sails and perot could have done even better
9215513 one has to hope for mccains sake that palin has been fully vetted
9215514 the next thing you have to ask yourself is it worrisome to have a gambler in the
9215515 tutti sanno che il mio modello mani basse e dare tutto fino alla fine

9215580 latteggiamento del governo pi teso al colpo di teatro ma non ha nessuna strategia tanti colpi ad effetto tanti mortaretti ma nessuna cosa vera che dia il segno di un cambiamento
9215581 nel secondo semestre del 2007 e nei primi quattro mesi del 2008 dice abbiamo assistito ad un calo omogeneo dei reati nelle diverse citt metropolitane soprattutto laddove sono stati firmati i patti per la sicurezza
9215582 a ferragosto come di solito avviene il titolare del viminale d i numeri dei reati questanno pero non accaduto

9215588 un ringraziamento affettuoso e cordiale al vostro leader che ha voluto fortissimamente arrivare a firmare questo accordo accordo che giunge dopo quei momenti tragici e drammatici delloccupazione italiana del vostro paese a nome del popolo italiano come capo del governo mi sento in dovere di porgere le scuse e manifestare il nostro dolore per quello che accaduto tanti anni fa e che ha segnato molte delle vostre famiglie

9215800 ever wondered who the funny looking kids with their bangs slicked to the front of their faces are you can barely make out one eye the boys who wear a size zero in girls jeans and who wear way too much eyeliner well you may have heard of them being classified as emo some of you are probably asking what emo really is and that is a very good question a lot of people dont have a definite idea or definition of what emo people are where it can come from and what it stands for etc nowadays it seems that most people have a lot of misconceptions on what emo is i asked a few students what they think of when they hear the word emo 15 year old freshman elise lopilato said when she hears the word emo she thinks of it as music and thinks of it as a genre and a life style 14 year old freshman cara floreske thinks it literally means the abbreveation of emotional which is true emo is the first three letters of emo tional i think teenagers and maybe some adults have a hard time understanding the lifestyle of it adults especially would have a harder time understanding it considering their children may dress emo which is why they may have a harder time understanding what it is since they didnt have this in their generation maybe they did it may have been classified as gothic or goth i think its common for people to mistake emo for goth now lets talk fashion band t shirts are very popular in the emo world especially for the guys sweatshirts are kind of questionable if you do decide to wear a sweatshirt they cannot be hollister american eagle abercrombie amp fitch or almost anything promoting a college university or technical institute jackets on the other hand are a little different black brown and or gray velvet corduroy and or tweed is acceptable anything with a school emblem or name tag on it is not acceptable now as for jeans black gray or normal colored skinny jeans nothing with a draw string shoes converse vision street and vans no k swiss timberland or birkenstocks you should probably have a studded belt and studded leather no woven leather since most people dont understand what emo is they automatically assume that they dont have any friends therefore they are all social outcasts if that is the case unfortunately then yes they are going to dress like emo its not a bad thing people who are emo do have friends most teenagers dont think that though music is a huge part of being emo everything that happens in their life good or bad they relate too music and pretty soon music becomes everything its mostly rock but it can be anything from alternative punk indie to metal hardcore screamo emo is sometimes referring to genre music as mentioned ealier in this article emo people go to a lot of concerts and shows whether they are local or something huge the vans warper tour or taste of chaos tour this article is not meant to judge people even more if you choose to i hope you have a better understanding on emo is some people maybe just emo because they like the style and such being emo does nto mean that you have no friends you may think of it as a stereotype you may think of it as something that you would rather not bother with do whatever you may wish as i mentioned i hope you now have a better understanding of what it is

9216060 prima qualit puoi fare grandi cose ma non devi mai dimenticare che esiste una mano che guida i tuoi passi

9216063 quarta qualit ci che realmente importante nella matita non il legno o la sua forma esteriore bens la grafite della mina racchiusa in essa dunque presta sempre attenzione a quello che accade dentro di te

9216197 for a tiny child the mmr is a ridiculous thing to do it has definitely caused autism
9216198 effective treatment for autism could begin only once the psychoanalytic approach was abandoned it wasnt possible to develop educational interventions while autism was blamed on the mythical refrigerator mother the unfeeling over intellectual career woman
9216199 its my opinion that psychoanalysis has nothing whatever to offer autistics i mean the talking treatment for children with no language i know one case a boy of 12 who didnt speak the analyst played chess with him for a year and a half psychoanalysts dont know beans about special education theyre a bunch of failed poets they work with symbols and autistic people dont understand symbols to them a tree is a tree

9216217 on the pitch his life was in acute danger five emergency doctors then applied immediate medical treatment afterwards he was responsive again and his heart rate was stable
9216218 i went to visit umit in hospital and what he wanted most of all was to get out of bed and be back on the football field
9216219 its a big step for john from the conference but he is a big lad with bags of pace and we feel he has it in him to become a championship player
9216220 he missed pre season with a slight groin problem so he may need a little while to get fully match fit but i expect him to be challenging for a first team place very soon
9216221 in den ersten tagen habe ich im arbeitszimmer in einem sessel geschlafen die t r zum garten blieb offen ich wollte nicht dass alle im bett sind wenn fernandito heimkommt
9216222 jedes ger usch schreckte mich hoch jede nacht kamen anrufe von den entf hrern
9216223 wir verhandelten unter den f rchterlichen drohungen dass sie unseren sohn erh ngen wenn wir nicht zahlen man muss sich das vorstellen ber seinen eigenen sohn reden wie ber eine ware die gegen geld verkauft wird
9216224 ich h tte nie gedacht dass sie unseren sohn zu dem zeitpunkt l ngst brutal ermordet hatten
9216225 wir bergaben dann das l segeld und sie sagten dass fernando in zwei stunden freigelassen w rde
9216226 das waren die schlimmsten qualen unseres lebens jeden moment erwarteten wir ihn aber er kam nie mehr zur ck
9216227 habt erbarmen ich flehe euch an gebt mir meine tochter zur ck
9216228 von ganzem herzen sage ich euch ich empfinde keinen groll keinen hass es wird keine repressalien geben nur belohnungen ich gebe euch was ihr verlangt und ihr gebt mir meine tochter zur ck

9216243 we live in xenia oh and it was wiped by a tornado in 1974 and it killed 68 people and again in 2000 where one person was killed and several were injured
9216244 we werent hurt but the whole town was devastated we were out of power for days and you really need to have something to help you get through that time until the authorities can get things cleaned up having gone through it before it made sense to make survival kits available to everyone
9216245 we want to ensure that people have access to a form of survival preparation a plan a first aid kit and even a tent if needed
9216246 if theres something about a storm coming in well post information to help people get prepared

9216259 deep wounds caused by italian colonisation to the people of libya
9216260 the accord will provide for 200 million dollars a year over the next 25 years through investments in infrastructure projects in libya
9216261 this agreement should put an end to 40 years of discord it is a concrete and moral acknowledgement of the damage inflicted on libya by italy during the colonial era
9216262 krishna kumar birla passed away this morning at his kolkata residence
9216263 there were many business leaders who were worried who were apprehensive who were nervous about the economic changes
9216264 understood the importance and the relevance of what we were doing
9216265 he was an outstanding visionary a great parliamentarian a business leader par excellence and a builder of modern educational and scientific institutions
9216266 59 per cent of black caribbean children are looked after by a lone parent
9216267 i felt like i had to play my game serve huge and that served me well
9216268 she is very consistent it always helps when i dont make a lot of errors
9216269 i would have loved if we could have met in the final
9216270 my biggest worry is that she is so good im worried how im going to get past her more than anything
9216271 she played well that time im looking forward to continuing to serve well and move well and play well out here
9216272 it is my duty as a head of government to express to you in the name of the italian people our regret and apologies for the deep wounds that we have caused you
9216273 the accord will provide for 200 million us dollars a year over the next 25 years through investments in infrastructure projects in libya
9216274 this agreement should put an end to 40 years of discord it is a concrete and moral acknowledgement of the damage inflicted on libya by italy during the colonial era
9216275 this is an historic moment when two brave men acknowledge the defeat of colonialism
9216276 the libyan people endured injustice and were attacked in their homes and they deserve an apology and compensation
9216277 a sudden burst of dignity humanity and respect so as to finally give satisfaction to the 20 000 italian citizens who are still waiting for fair compensation from their government

9216279 please upgrade your iphone so our communitys cell tower serves us better
9216280 there were mixed emotions watching the lions the first time because it was arguable whether i would have gone
9216281 but before the last tour clive woodward the coach told me that i would be on the plane provided i was fit so not to make it was deeply frustrating
9216282 im always trying to make myself better in terms of handling skills not just crashing it up all the time which is how people seem to see me
9216283 i wanted someone with experience and character who wouldnt be sidelined or sidetracked by national ambitions
9216284 that ruled tom rees and james haskell out of the reckoning for me
9216285 i love to eat but i still have a problem digesting that game
9216286 this year we want to be around eighth in january
9216287 weve taken a young group of players through two years quite fast
9216288 and there have been times on that journey when we would have benefited from a wider circle of experience greg and olly give us that
9216289 i really do but the ideal package is a young man with experience
9216290 last year 11 of my squad were involved in the world cup that had a detrimental affect on our chances this year not many of my squad are involved with their international teams also i would rather have a smaller squad rotating and playing regularly than a larger one getting stale on the bench or out of action altogether
9216291 that law will remove the necessity to have those types of players
9216292 the fact that you can now collapse a maul means the real concentration up front is on the scrummage and we have someone all black carl hayman whos quite good at that
9216293 i want to go out for bath and expose myself
9216294 it felt like we had to defend a thousand corners and it shows the character of the team that we did that we withstood a bombardment and at times still played our football
9216295 we had two offside goals plus opportunities that were stopped on the edge of the box by them giving away free kicks so most of the pressure throughout the game came from us
9216296 i think it was a game we could easily have got three points from but we could easily have lost it as well
9216297 the pleasing thing was that we stood up to the bombardment that came our way and there are hopefully a few other additions to come that will help us cope with teams like bolton and the questions they ask you
9216298 thats the team they are and you have just got to withstand it
9216299 im not interested if the ball was over the line or not
9216300 the referee is the one who makes the decision along with the linesman so it doesnt matter what i think
9216301 im not going to say if it was a goal or not it doesnt matter it was 0 0
9216302 its not about one person its about setting standards of behaviour in training its to do with having a culture where guys are responsible for themselves and their team mates
9216303 we can sit here and say we are going to do this or we are going to do that but we have got to do it on the field
9216304 martins exactly the same as he was as a player
9216305 he brings an awareness to any situation he commands respect not just from the squad but from rugby people everywhere hell do a great job
9216306 the scores the score we are where we are weve got the agreement in place weve got the best players in england its our job to help them to become better players and a better team well get judged on results in the field thats it
9216307 perhaps my mum should not have had me when she did but i think it is a bit harsh to blame her
9216308 dan carter is the best in the world and i have never said otherwise yes it is frustrating but i have made the most of my chances and am very proud of what i have achieved for the all blacks
9216309 i am here to help harlequins achieve their ambitions and to improve my game if they change the rules and allow overseas players to play for new zealand who knows
9216310 not a bad place to start is it it is certainly an inspiration having the great stadium across the road from the stoop and with plans to attract 50 000 people to twickenham for our christmas game against leicester it shows i have joined a club with plenty of ambition
9216311 i love my deep sea fishing back in new zealand i hope to get up to scotland some time for the salmon fishing i have heard so much about
9216312 danny is a great player among a host of talented young guys at the club we want to push for a top four finish
9216313 dean talked about how he wanted quins to play the game and what he wanted to achieve
9216314 afl probably put 10 to 20 yards on my kicking it taught me game awareness and how to kick under pressure
9216315 accounts she hadnt opened then grew suspicious when landlord phivos ioannou asked if she had received any mail that didnt belong to her
9216316 our process allows us to take a hydrofluorocarbon and transform it so that its no longer a greenhouse gas
9216317 its a very hard nut to crack and they finally got it to work
9216318 i dont think baseball could survive without all the statistical appurtenances involved in calculating pitching hitting and fielding percentages some people could do without the games as long as they got the box scores
9216319 joshi had addressed mediapersons on friday wherein he supported the marathi signboard issue and said that every shop owner should abide by the law which required nameboards in marathi but his own institute is violating the government order
9216320 to the best of my knowledge all the signboards are in marathi
9216321 if there is any english board at any place i will see to it that it is replaced immediately and a marathi signboard comes up prominently in its place
9216322 they were suffering from metastasing brain tumours caused by various cancers mainly lung and breast cancer that failed to respond to conventional treatment and were otherwise inoperable
9216323 the patients feels nothing during the operation and generally can leave hospital 14 hours later the evening or the morning after the operation
9216324 this is the first time that laser technology has been used intracranially meaning inside an enclosed skull using mri in real time to avoid collateral damage
9216325 this is the forerunner of future techniques in which mri will play a core intervention role in neurosurgery
9216326 this happened quite soon after the original burial its not that a grave robber took it centuries later and hid it with the intention of coming back
9216327 the young workman who saw it was astounded and shouted land mine
9216328 archaeologists must explain why such a group was found outside the extensive royal cemetery
9216329 they must also work out why the bones of the unknown but by no means insignificant person were hidden in the citys most public and sacred area
9216330 but new orleaneans are very tough and resilient and we will get through this
9216331 things werent really as bad as they could have been
9216332 elect us give us power in the congress and we will end the iraq war
9216333 one of the great lies about american politics is that democrats genuinely subscribe to a set of core convictions that make democrats different from republicans
9216334 did not maintain any books and records with respect to the financial operations of the corporation
9216335 not have any documents in its possession custody or control that are relevant to payments made by the debtor to ann walsh
9216336 next time some tv talking head brings up sarah palins lack of foreign policy experience can somebody please point out that the democrats in 2004 picked john edwards as their vice presidential candidate

9216339 it is my duty as a head of government to express to you in the name of the italian people our regret and apologies for the deep wounds that we have caused you
9216340 the accord will provide for 200 million us dollars a year over the next 25 years through investments in infrastructure projects in libya

9216350 its a big step for john from the conference but he is a big lad with bags of pace and we feel he has it in him to become a championship player
9216351 he missed pre season with a slight groin problem so he may need a little while to get fully match fit but i expect him to be challenging for a first team place very soon

9216365 apparently it is ar 15s and 223 ammo i watched at least 20 people buy ar 15s and cases of 223
9216366 any methods within the rules can be used to accomplish this and stop your opponents from doing the same mining ore yourself killing enemy miners and looting their wrecks stealing from enemy jetcans or just outright destroying the opposing team are all within the rules
9216367 the welcoming committee is a criminal enterprise made up of 35 anarchists who are intent on committing criminal acts before and during the republican national convention
9216368 these acts include tactics to blockade and disable delegate buses breaching venue security and injuring police officers they have recruited assistance in their criminal conspiracy from other anarchists groups throughout the country through their plans and actions they have exhibited a blatant disregard for the law and the safety of others
9216369 conspiracy to riot was the charge used against the chicago eight in 1968 as part of a politically motivated prosecution
9216370 it is a charge that is essentially used for preventive detention
9216371 we have worked very very hard to make sure weve protected peoples right to exercise free speech
9216372 to pick up a protest sign thats fine if youre here to pick up a brick or some other instrument theres a problem
9216373 i dont know what happened with the boarding but theyve corrected it and im grateful to our folks at dsi department of safety and inspections for seeing the mistake
9216374 its what my father fought in the war for to me this smacks of preemptive strike against free speech
9216375 derail rnc protest organizing efforts and to intimidate and terrorize individuals and groups converging in the twin cities to exercise what are supposed to be their basic civil rights
9216376 we just like the republicans have the right to free speech
9216377 the place they raided last night they were showing documentary movies to twenty somethings in a clean alcohol free zone after dinner
9216378 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
9216379 mats has been involved in united nations charities for quite a while
9216380 if they say we cant guarantee your safety you dont go
9216381 these subjects are part of a longer and mid term discussion
9216382 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country then recognizing part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy
9216383 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9216384 our focus is really on this side of the river
9216385 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side
9216386 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in
9216387 if you cannot multitask or communicate without being passive aggressive dont even bother replying
9216388 i can be a tad difficult to work for im loud pushy and while i used to think we paid well i am no longer sure
9216389 i made a commitment to stay in the job for at least a year
9216390 i met the oldest child but not the others which my mother said was crazy to accept the job without meeting all the kids so well see
9216391 if you are fundamentally unhappy with your life you will be more unhappy if you take this job so do us all a favor and get some treatment or move to the rockies but do not apply for employment with us
9216392 also if you suspect all wealthy women are frivolous we are not for you
9216393 i have all sorts of theories on how to stack my dishwasher and if you are judgmental about ritalin for adhd or think such things are caused by too much sugar again deal break city
9216394 think blink or sleep on it the impact of modes of thought on complex decision making
9216395 if you have to make decisions you have to do your homework
9216396 i did some research to try to figure out why the dutch had been able to see differences we hadnt
9216397 both cars in the experiment were equal so i would expect roughly equal numbers of the subjects to chose each car
9216398 its overly bold to recommend that as a way of making decisions
9216399 but that doctor has 20 to 30 years of experience and has in the past employed deliberate decision making so maybe over time these decisions become automated
9216400 going with your gut may be right when youre an expert for example maybe choosing lunch every day is easy because we do it every day but we dont move every day so when making a choice about where to live we have no expertise
9216401 the initial agreement has been signed and we are waiting to see the approval of both governments
9216402 i dont like it going someplace you dont know people you dont know
9216403 and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9216404 the problem is there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9216405 the firefly populations have dropped 70 percent in the past three years
9216406 when you talk to old people about fireflies it is always the same
9216407 they saw so many when they were young and now they are lucky now if they see one
9216408 i know of populations that have disappeared on my farm because of development and light pollution
9216409 its these mcmansions with their floodlights one house has 32 lights why do you need so many lights
9216410 researchers hope this would allow us to track firefly populations over many years to determine if they are remaining stable or disappearing
9216411 das sind jahrhundertealte traditionen und ich werde sie weiter verteidigen
9216412 vim cumprimentar o leo moura que meu amigo e curte v lei ele ficou acordado para torcer pela gente vou aproveitar minha folga no domingo e vou para o maracan quero dar energia ao time pois um jogo importante para a conquista do t tulo
9216413 he told each of the governors that federal officials were monitoring hurricane gustav very closely
9216414 president bush pledged the full support of the federal government
9216415 and patents are not necessary as an incentive to innovate
9216416 ok but in that case a law allowing this or that
9216417 the truth is the contents of the book in question leads to a lot of misery pain lack of freedom and often death

9216419 based upon our polling in key battleground states in 2007 and early 2008 all indicators pointed to john mccain as the only plausible republican presidential nominee
9216420 our polling showed that mccain was the second choice of the other candidates supporters particularly in florida which really made mccains nomination possible our polling in 2008 have shown that barack obama underperforms among female voters particularly in the states of ohio michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin that provides an opening for senator mccain
9216421 additionally john mccain has a unique opportunity to present the future of the republican party in his vice presidential selection
9216422 we are hoping to have a quick unfolding of this investigation so we can basically reconcile these numbers which are way too far apart right now
9216423 it is obviously a case where all three have received different bits of information and they need to reconcile this
9216424 obviously there is somebody that does not have the right information
9216425 as we have already said we support the idea of a joint investigation in which all relevant institutions are involved this must be a broad based investigation we believe this is a right way forward and we will be open and cooperative
9216426 everybody is willing to find the truth and to do this you got to get to the facts and compare information that everybody has received

9216588 it is conceivable that some people will think john mccain picked sarah palin to be his running mate because she is a woman i know you find this shocking but i swear i have heard it mentioned mccain does not believe in pandering to identity politics he was looking for someone who was well prepared to fight against international islamic extremism the transcendent issue of our time and in the end he decided that in good conscience he was not going to settle for anyone who had not been commander of a state national guard for at least a year and a half he put down his foot the obvious choice was palin the governor of alaska whose guard stands as our last best defense against possible attack by the resurgent russian menace across the bering strait nt

9216591 democrats are good republicans are bad but you filipinos probably know that
9216592 ive been around long enough to know that when the vultures are around it gets difficult
9216593 ive never had it before but you just have to deal with it id rather it was directed at me than the players
9216594 jermain was great the goals were two excellent bits of skill from a top class striker
9216595 we worked hard on our system all week and getting this result should give the players a lot of belief
9216596 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9216597 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9216598 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9216599 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9216600 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9216601 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9216602 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9216603 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9216604 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9216605 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9216606 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9216607 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9216608 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9216609 an audio codec is needed to play this file to determine if this codec is available to download from the web click web help
9216610 windows media player cannot play the file or cannot play either the audio or video portion of the file because the sharp g 726 audio 45 codec is not installed on your computer
9216611 i dont want to call into question the ability or impartiality of the people appointed
9216612 however when the minister had the opportunity to appoint seven commissioners and could not find a single one from sa with the impartiality and skills to do the job it beggars belief
9216613 we have people of the calibre of professor mike young who would be eminently qualified
9216614 i recognise the system needs to be managed on a national basis and away from parochial state interests but we also have to have confidence that the grave concerns about the river system in sa are brought to the table
9216615 the role of the national water commission is to audit reform by the states whereas the new murray darling basin authority has a much more significant role in shaping the future of the basin
9216616 the government recently announced south australian robert freeman as the new head of the murray darling basin authority
9216617 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9216618 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9216619 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9216620 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9216621 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9216622 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9216623 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9216624 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9216625 we hope the public will like the contemporary design of this landmark building which will help lift the quality of hotels and office space in grimsby town centre and contribute to the regeneration of the area
9216626 there is still work going on and there will still be some disruption for which we would apologise to the patients
9216627 but im sure once we are at the end of the scheme they will see that its been worthwhile
9216628 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9216629 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9216630 cannot complete assessment the assessment or other operation did not complete successfully
9216631 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9216632 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9216633 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9216634 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9216635 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9216636 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9216637 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9216638 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9216639 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9216640 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9216641 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9216642 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9216643 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9216644 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9216645 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9216646 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9216647 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9216648 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9216649 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9216650 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9216651 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9216652 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9216653 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9216654 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9216655 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9216656 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9216657 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9216658 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9216659 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9216660 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9216661 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9216662 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9216663 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9216664 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9216665 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9216666 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9216667 who are open to doing something on the production side
9216668 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9216669 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9216670 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9216671 as for russias prestige we dont like whats been happening but we did not provoke this situation speaking of prestige some countries prestige has been severely damaged in recent years
9216672 muito s bio e prudente mas ao mesmo tempo muito jovem
9216673 dann schie t ein h llischer schmerz meinen arm hoch
9216674 in meiner hand schwirrt ein knochenst ckchen lose herum wenn mein handgelenk in einigen kurven eine bestimmte position einnimmt dann werden nerven eingeklemmt und dann schie t ein h llischer schmerz meinen arm hoch ich kann damit aber umgehen schlie lich haben wir an diesem wochenende einen wichtigen job zu erledigen
9216675 wir haben die front ein bisschen verbessert was mir ein anliegen war ich bin jetzt sehr zufrieden mit der balance
9216676 das problem ist dass es zu lange dauert bis ich meinen rhythmus finde weil ich auf der linken seite der reifen in den ersten sechs oder sieben runden zu wenig grip habe das lie e sich mit einer weicheren gummimischung l sen aber ich bin nicht sicher ob ich damit die renndistanz berstehen w rde wir werden das im warmup noch ausloten
9216677 wir mussten am nachmittag ein bisschen was ndern um mehr stabilit t zu gewinnen meine techniker haben das gro artig gemacht
9216678 nun werde ich zum ersten mal aus der zweiten startreihe losfahren ich hoffe auf einen guten start damit ich mich an die besten anh ngen kann ich bin wirklich guter dinge denn ich war nicht nur im qualifying schnell sondern ich habe heute auch f r den renntrimm etwas gefunden
9216679 auch wenn toni gestern nur 14 war so waren wir sehr nahe an der spitze dran wir haben das gewicht an der front etwas verringert und dadurch gelang uns ein gro er schritt nach vorne morgen ist aber der entscheidende tag auch wenn wir zugegebenerma en ein bisschen stolz auf unser heutiges abschneiden sind
9216680 aber ich denke positiv denn im renntrimm haben wir heute einiges gefunden mit ein paar kleinen nderungen im warmup ist sogar noch mehr drin mich trennt nur eine halbe sekunde von der zweiten reihe daher glaube ich dass mit einem guten start wirklich alles passieren kann
9216681 i want to find you in real life and give you a hug and then pull the cord

9216710 o candidato que compra votos n o tem interesse nenhum que aquele eleitor se torne consciente ele sempre far trabalhos assistencialistas o mau pol tico quer que o povo continue carente ignorante e que funcione como massa de manobra temos que combater isso
9216711 importante que se saiba em quem se est votando o eleitor tem que entender que ele a grande estrela que ele controla o processo eleitoral

9216725 tiene como principales vecinos decenas de vertidos de escombros basuras maleza hierbas secas y un sinf n de desechos que convierten este lugar muy conocido entre los vecinos de la pobla en un rea inh spita
9216726 evidenciaron la forma de vida de las familias que las habitaron en su poca con el nimo principal de evitar su ca da o deterioro progresivo de estas construcciones
9216727 ya que forman parte de la historia de la pobla que debemos conservar como parte de nuestro pasado no queremos que vuelvan a ocurrir episodios recientes como el de la casa blanca que finalmente fue derribada a pesar de su gran valor hist rico
9216728 los alrededores m s pr ximos a esta mas a antigua tampoco invitan al optimismo ya que muy cercanos se hallan los vertederos incontrolados de escombros pl sticos y electrodom sticos denunciados repetidamente por el pspv ante la inoperancia e incapacidad del equipo de gobierno del pp en una zona de gran valor paisaj stico y ambiental
9216729 es una ficha m s del ajedrez de paj n
9216730 el problema que se divisa una vez m s es la falta de voluntad pol tica de la conselleria de educaci n pues la generalitat es quien tiene las competencias sobre ense anza
9216731 prefiere medidas de promoci n de las guarder as privadas en lugar de crear plazas de infantil en colegios p blicos
9216732 todav a muy lejos de haber conseguido la universalizaci n de la escolarizaci n en el tramo de tres a seis a os
9216733 las denuncias de padres y madres de alumnos que han visto rechazadas sus solicitudes de escolarizaci n en el segundo ciclo de educaci n infantil
9216734 esto impide la universalizaci n real de la educaci n infantil ya que su mayor o menor cobertura depende de cada comunidad aut noma y tristemente
9216735 muchos padres y madres ya han comprobado cual es la pol tica educativa del pp
9216736 las nicas medidas que la conselleria parece tomar y que tampoco resuelven totalmente el problema son la habilitaci n de barracones y el aumento de las ratios de los grupos
9216737 deber a dedicarse a buscar ya soluciones adecuadas para la escolarizaci n de todos los ni os y ni as en la red p blica en lugar de alimentar pol micas absurdas sobre la asignatura de educaci n para la ciudadan a epc
9216738 salga sacando pecho de su gesti n cuando hay ni os y ni as de tres o cuatro a os sin escuela
9216739 una de las actuaciones necesarias para responder al incremento demogr fico es ampliar el n mero de plazas en las escuelas p blicas y la construcci n de nuevas en lugar de potenciar los conciertos con colegios privados
9216740 en un pa s adelantado la escolarizaci n de un menor en el colegio p blico de su lugar de residencia deber a ser un derecho garantizado y ahora mismo esto no es as en muchos pueblos y ciudades
9216741 la partida presupuestaria ahora anunciada por el gobierno central para la educaci n de cero a tres a os fue conseguida por iu en la negociaci n de los presupuestos del estado en 2007
9216742 consigui este compromiso en la negociaci n de los presupuestos del estado de 2008

9216747 hay que sumar el mill n de personas en la comunitat que de una manera u otra se ver n tambi n beneficiadas por las l neas dedicadas a la sensibilizaci n

9216751 todos estos voluntarios tienen en com n unos y otros es que trabajan desde el altruismo para hacer de la nuestra una sociedad m s justa y por tanto m s avanzada

9216805 the esamann scholarships provide a tremendous boost in the campaigns remaining nine months
9216806 before the campaign ends in may 2009 we are determined to fully fund all of our previously announced campaign goals
9216807 from his work his world travels and his continuing self education mr esamann understood the increasing globalization of society and technology
9216808 he knew that individuals skilled in math and science will help lead 21st century research and economic development so he established scholarships to encourage students in those disciplines
9216809 thats why we have made endowed scholarships the highest priority of butlerrising
9216810 we must have committed and secure funding for scholarships to keep educational access open to the many truly talented and deserving students who want a butler degree
9216811 we played a new system using wingbacks the players have worked hard on it all week and that result should give them a lot of belief
9216812 ive been wanting to do it for a long time weve got the personnel to do it with pace at the back and two attacking fullbacks

9216836 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso

9216866 de gokmaffia heeft de achtste finale tussen brazili en ghana op de wereldbeker van 2006 in duitsland gemanipuleerd
9216867 een vrouw achter een bureau zal niemand tegenhouden om te spijbelen ook mij niet
9216868 als men spijbelen wil tegengaan moeten er striktere regels worden opgesteld
9216869 misschien kan het stadsbestuur beter n spijbelambtenaar per school in dienst nemen
9216870 zo zou elk schoolteam kunnen terugvallen op een eigen spijbelfunctionaris waardoor de spijbelaanpak binnen elke school meer gespecialiseerd en bijgevolg effici nter wordt daarenboven zou het de individuele begeleiding van leerlingen kunnen vergemakkelijken
9216871 met het parket onderzoeken we of deze vrouwen onder dwang kunnen worden behandeld
9216872 met ons gezondheidshuis antwerpse prostitutie leveren we al inspanningen daarnaast sturen we vier mensen op pad om de prostituees op te zoeken in hun werkomgeving we sensibiliseren en wijzen hen door naar de gespecialiseerde gezondheidszorg
9216873 dankzij deze aanpak kregen we de straatprostitutie aan het atheneum van antwerpen onder controle
9216874 we zitten nu nog met een tiental gemarginaliseerde tippelaarsters de huidige aanpak heeft geen vat op deze vrouwen daarom onderzoeken we met het parket of het mogelijk is om deze vrouwen te dwingen om zich te laten behandelen
9216875 ze bleken alleen maar problemen aan te trekken bovendien blijkt nu dat we tippelprostitutie onder controle hebben
9216876 today was a celebration for us here at the flint hills job corp

9216882 they dont want to keep the jordan valley but they want certain arrangements
9216883 in all likelihood were israel to abandon the strategic barrier of the jordan valley shoulder fired missiles capable of taking down a 747 jumbo jet would soon appear on high ground in the west bank that dominates israels international ben gurion airport
9216884 strategic depth is very important for israel but israel can have better security with a peace agreement than by keeping the west bank

9216912 i got the genes that said run run with the wind
9216913 na verdade a gente estava meio acostumado a jogar sem o thiago est sendo assim desde que ele foi convocado para as olimp adas acho que n o teremos problema no cl ssico
9216914 o thiago neves j foi ele passado nosso elenco tem jogadores qualificados que s o capazes de substitui lo a altura
9216915 por um lado a gente fica triste porque ele um grande amigo mas a gente fica feliz em saber que ele vai para uma melhor sobre quem vai entrar no seu lugar temos o conca e o tart que podem suprir a aus ncia do thiago
9216916 tivemos uma oferta tentadora pelo guilherme do d namo de kiev eles pagariam cinco milh es de euros mais de r 10 milh es por um ano de empr stimo com uma op o de adquirir cem por cento dos direitos pagando mais cinco milh es de euros mas dentro do nosso projeto de conquista est no ataque a nossa maior defici ncia at por isso contratamos o thiago e fizemos o sacrif cio para manter o guilherme

9216920 because of the nature of global telecommunications we are playing with a tremendous home field advantage and we need to exploit that edge
9216921 we also need to protect that edge and we need to protect those who provide it to us
9216922 there is an ongoing concern that u s intelligence agencies will gather this information without legal process there is particular sensitivity about access to financial information as well as communications and internet traffic that goes through u s switches
9216923 its no different than any other infrastructure that a country needs
9216924 are on a rampage to build out across india and china so they have alternative routes and so they dont have to route through the u s
9216925 we discovered the internet but we couldnt keep it a secret
9216926 whether its a good or a bad thing depends on where you stand
9216927 suppose the internet was entirely confined to the u s which it once was that wasnt helpful
9216928 were probably in one of those situations where things get a little bit harder
9216929 this is one of many dimensions on which well have to adjust to a reduction in american ability to dictate terms of core interests of ours
9216930 we are by comparison militarily weaker economically poorer and technologically less unique than we were then we are still a very big player but not in control

9216936 how does sen john mccain ever again question sen barack obamas experience or argue that obama isnt ready to lead
9216937 its hard to imagine mccain could do either after choosing alaska gov sarah palin to be his running mate seeking to put a woman who until recently was mayor of a tiny city one breath away from the presidency
9216938 well its not haskell but at least x is functional
9216939 as head of comedy ive spent a lot of my time arguing about budgets and the mechanical bits of making shows
9216940 there have been occasions when you say lets just make a deal knowing everyone is unhappy where no one gets the budget they want to make their programme there are people that are inspired by that but im not one of them im much happier being closer to programmes
9216941 since ive been there ive lived through whole seismic changes and there is a feeling that some of it has gone back to where it was really those changes have put production and broadcast at odds with each other and thats quite difficult to work through it has set the people that produce programmes in direct opposition to the people responsible for actually paying for and broadcasting them and im not sure its a model that is desperately suited to the bbc its quite hard to find people now wholl defend it
9216942 there had to be a way of making people much more accountable and so it got a lot tighter
9216943 at the bbc youre very close to all the finance people so its much easier for them to come and have long conversations with you about budgets than if you were working in an independent because there they cant get hold of you
9216944 a lot of the really interesting things happen right on the margins of taste and audiences are i suspect more willing to take a bit more of a risk they will accept slightly more than weve given them
9216945 one of the bbcs own annual reports that talked about the achievements of the year once used the phrase all the way from high value costume drama right the way down to sitcom
9216946 unfortunately the term sitcom implies a great disdain people say it with a curl of their lips
9216947 if you go back over most of the big successful shows they had a torrid birth
9216948 i think theyre genuinely good writers and they really know that world but theyve tried to cram too much in
9216949 ed and johnny have got quite a lot to do in working out just exactly what the show is at the moment its got too many disparate elements in there but thats not a bad thing you can hone a show down and work out what you like
9216950 people will absolutely love it or they will say whats the point of bringing that back and im afraid the answer lies in between its got some great moments jennifer is wrong if she thinks the series wasnt liked by a large number of people and was critically hammered because it wasnt
9216951 im afraid i found this one as dire as its title a group of stereotypical characters in a clich d setting i cant see this being anything other than a major disaster
9216952 how many times have you wept since you learned of my betrayal
9216953 his mam and dad have always been there for him hes invented this sob story just to dupe the judges into putting him through
9216954 this is the third time alan has auditioned for the x factor the other times he didnt get through so his antics this time have clearly worked
9216955 it was always made clear she wasnt my real nan or my mum

9217090 israels ability to develop as a free and open society
9217091 the moral and political price israeli society will have to pay to overcome the resistance that the hard core of the settlers is bound to show to any just and reasonable solution
9217092 an ugly and violent form of colonial occupation the authoritarian regime in the territories the creation of two legal systems the placing of the army and police at the service of the settlement movement the robbing of palestinian lands these all symbolize not the fulfillment of zionism but rather its burial it is there between hebron and yitzhar that the settlements are burying the democratic jewish state
9217093 the nationalist messianist fervor and the desire to end the war of independence merged into the momentum for occupation the entire right and most of the left bear joint responsibility for the gradual creation of the disaster in which israeli society is wallowing
9217094 since it was impossible to take control of the lands legally a mafia like culture of theft lies and deception developed in the territories in which the various government authorities are still wallowing from ministers in tailored suits to the last of the policemen sweating on the highways contrary to the rules of international and israeli law contrary to elementary rules of justice contrary to all logic and every genuine israeli interest broad areas were confiscated for the sake of the settlers and huge sums were poured in
9217095 when the public finally realized that if the jewish national movement does not absorb universal foundations of human rights democracy and the rule of law it will doom itself to destruction a force had already arisen over the green line that now threatens to drown all of israel thus a minority took control of the fate of the entire society and held it hostage due both to the lefts ideological impotence and a lack of character determination and leadership if society does not find the emotional strength to remove the noose of the settlements nothing but a sad memory will remain of the jewish state as it still exists
9217096 its really good to hear about the imminent death of zionism let it be quick and allow jewish ethics to return to israel

9217207 if you think about it 10 years ago this didnt seem like horrible idea to ask for someones personal information
9217208 you could say its probably unlikely that someone will know all of this information about me or spent the time necessary to gather it but now its really easy for someone whos never met you to know all this about you
9217209 in some cases its easier for an attacker with good data mining skills than the real person to answer these questions
9217210 its not so easy to match up a pet name from facebook with another database of login names and another database of social security numbers
9217211 it would be incredibly difficult to recover from something like that

9217231 we can confirm that two bodies were recovered last night from the main part of osbaston house maesbrook
9217232 the remains will be examined by a home office pathologist and post mortems are due to be carried out later today to establish the cause of death
9217233 it is going to be a painstaking and lengthy process before the full examination of the house and its surrounds is completed

9217237 he was just an ordinary everyday chap well dressed a good businessman
9217238 they dont want to keep the jordan valley but they want certain arrangements
9217239 in all likelihood were israel to abandon the strategic barrier of the jordan valley shoulder fired missiles capable of taking down a 747 jumbo jet would soon appear on high ground in the west bank that dominates israels international ben gurion airport

9217241 people know that even if they apply for a permit they wont be able to obtain it
9217242 whats troubling is that even if it was the israelis it happened in damascus in a safe area meters from the office of intelligence chief assef shawkat

9217249 locals in the county rushed out into the open and cracks appeared on house walls and many windows were broken
9217250 its never been done because the issues have been too big to surmount
9217251 the most diplomatic way of saying it is that there are just a lot of moving parts
9217252 so youd have a multiplicity of players on that side
9217253 all the relevant players are here in south africa at the moment and i think the length of the discussion will be determined by what progress they make

9217272 nebraskas academic and life skills services are genuine its not a cookie cutter type situation its customized for the individual and i think thats what sets nebraska apart from everybody else
9217273 the university of nebraska staff encouraged my development as an athlete and as a person they helped me to be creative manage my time and build my character poise and beliefs
9217274 i think it is instrumental that current student athletes have a chance to see the influence that the university of nebraska can have on their careers when i was a player a lot of people came to speak to us and i always thought it was good to see how they were succeeding in their lives after sports
9217275 la squadra ha fatto il massimo finch abbiamo mantenuto il modulo di partenza con pasquato in campo non abbiamo corso grandi pericoli

9217289 mr nami was there when i arrived and indeed we started a preliminary discussion but i think mr nami felt the need to inform me of this development so he interrupted and told me about it
9217290 but he did express the hope that this would not affect the talks that will begin on september 3
9217291 we must stay calm i was completely calm i state the reasons why i couldnt continue discussions i think it was a calm and correct decision when they are ready to truly talk then we will see what to do

9217399 meanwhile we get a fine picture here of the deep commitment to social justice or at least to their own vanity of clinton supporters
9217400 a spokesman for the obama campaign insisted on tuesday that its fund raising was on target and denied that 100 million a month was ever a real goal or that the campaign was having problems recruiting clinton donors
9217401 a new york times analysis of federal election committee records found that clinton donors contributed roughly 2 million to the obama campaign in july similar to what they gave in june the amount is not insubstantial but it appears to fall short of targets originally envisioned by obama fund raisers
9217402 grousing about the way they are being treated by the obama campaign in terms of hotel rooms credentials and the like
9217403 ive had more contact from the mccain campaign since the nomination than from the obama campaign said calvin fayard a new orleans lawyer major clinton fund raiser and longtime democratic donor who is not in denver this week mr fayard said he was considering supporting senator john mccain the republican citing what he perceived as mr obamas inexperience
9217404 my god if you dont get the hotel room to which your sense of entitlement leads you to expect then by all means you should support a far right war monger like senator mccain but wait arent they all just republocrats anyway or are you saying there really
9217405 now that senator mccain has chosen a woman as his running mate we will find out whether senator clintons supporters are really committed to justice and sanity or just to identity politics of the most vile sort

9217431 mackenzie evil is a word we use to describe the absence of good just as we use the word darkness to describe the absecnce of light or death to describe the absence of life both evil and darkness can only be understood in relation to light and good they do not have an actual existence i am light and i am good i am love and there is no darkness in me light and good actually exist so removing yourself from me will plunge you into darkness declaring independence from me will result in evil because apart from me you can only draw upon yourself that is death because you have separated yourself from me life

9217473 were hopeful with the dusting which is something new were doing now well be able to at least contain the extent of this plague
9217474 even with the loss of almost 10 000 acres of prairie dogs conata basin still remains the largest and most important prairie dog complex on federal lands in the great plains its worth all these efforts to save it
9217475 theres the plague and the prairie dogs and thats nature taking care of the expansion
9217476 i think we want to get along we want to be able to survive just the same as the prairie dogs want to survive we dont want to annihilate them we dont just get them under control so theyre not sick give the ferrets something healthy to eat

9217558 one of the greatest challenges preventing advances in new therapeutic options for treating cancer is the inability of anticancer drugs to effectively differentiate between cancerous and normal healthy body cells
9217559 many commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs target rapidly dividing cells but suffer from a relatively low therapeutic index which is the ratio of toxic dose to effective dose
9217560 preferential killing of cancer cells and activated human t cells using zno nanoparticles
9217561 until now no group in the world has been able to produce inherent selective cancer killing ability in nanoparticles
9217562 current chemotherapy drugs typically consist of single molecules and do not provide much room for manipulation of the molecule but nanoparticles can be modified so that certain characteristics like cancer killing attributes can be accentuated because of this we think there is room for improvement in what we have already demonstrated
9217563 oncology is always looking for a magic bullet which can kill only the cancer cells not killing the normal cells this work is a major step toward that
9217564 i think this work will pave the way for more targeted therapies
9217565 the bank hath benefit of interest on all monies which it creates out of nothing
9217566 that is simple in the colonies we issue our own money it is called colonial scrip we issue it in proper proportion to the demands of trade and industry to make the products pass easily from the producers to the consumers in this manner creating for ourselves our own paper money we control its purchasing power and we have no interest to pay no one
9217567 in one year the conditions were so reversed that the era of prosperity ended and a depression set in to such an extent that the streets of the colonies were filled with the unemployed the colonies would gladly have borne the little tax on tea and other matters had it not been that england took away from the colonies their money which created unemployment and dissatisfaction the viability of the colonists to get power to issue their own money permanently out of the hands of king george iii and the international bankers was the prime reason for the revolutionary war
9217568 this institution having no principle but that of avarice will never be varied in its objective to engross all the wealth power and influence of the state
9217569 the rich will strive to establish their dominion and enslave the rest they always did they always will they will have the same effect here as elsewhere if we do not by the power of government keep them in their proper spheres
9217570 if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and the corporations which grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered
9217571 a national debt if it is not excessive will be to us a national blessing
9217572 let me issue and control a nations money and i care not who writes the laws
9217573 i wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our constitution taking from the federal government their power of borrowing
9217574 the hand that gives is among the hand that takes money has no motherland financiers are without patriotism and without decency their sole object is gain
9217575 either the application for renewal of the charter is granted or the united states will find itself involved in a most disastrous war
9217576 it is not our own citizens only who are to receive the bounty of our government more than eight millions of the stock of the bank are held by foreigners is there no danger to out liberty and independence in a bank that in its nature has so little to bind it to our country controlling our currency receiving our public moneys and holding thousands of our citizens in dependence would be more formidable and dangerous than a military power of the enemy if government would confine itself to equal protection and as heaven does its rains shower the favor alike on the high and the low the rich and the poor it would be an unqualified blessing in the act before me there seems to be wide and unnecessary departure from these just principles
9217577 this worthy president thinks that because he has scalped indians and imprisoned judges he is to have his way with the bank he is mistaken
9217578 nothing but widespread suffering will produce any effect on congress our only safety is pursuing a steady course of firm restriction and i have no doubt that such a course will ultimately lead to restoration of the currency and re charter of the bank
9217579 you are a den of thieves vipers and i intend to rout you out and by the eternal god i will rout you out
9217580 from the time i took office as chancellor of the exchequer i began to learn that the state held in the face of the bank and the city an essentially false position as to finance the government itself was not to be a substantive power but was to leave the money power supreme and unquestioned
9217581 i have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the state where it now exists i believe i have no lawful right to do so and i have no inclination to do so my paramount objective is to save the union and it is not either to save or destroy slavery if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it
9217582 the division of the united states into federations of equal force was decided long before the civil war by the high financial powers of europe these bankers were afraid that the united states if they remained as one block and as one nation would attain economic and financial independence which would upset their financial domination over the world
9217583 why lincoln that is easy just get congress to pass a bill authorizing the printing of full legal tender treasury notes and pay your soldiers with them and go ahead and win your war with them also
9217584 the people or anyone else will not have any choice in the matter if you make them full legal tender they will have the full sanction of the government and be just as good as any money as congress is given that express right by the constitution
9217585 the government should create issue and circulate all the currency and credit needed to satisfy the spending power of the government and the buying power of consumers the privilege of creating and issuing money is not only the supreme prerogative of government but it is in the governments greatest creative opportunity by the adoption of these principles the taxpayers will be saved immense sums of interest money will cease to be master and become the servant of humanity
9217586 if that mischievous financial policy which had its origin in the north american republic should become indurated down to a fixture then that government will furnish its own money without cost it will pay off debts and be without a debt it will have all the money necessary to carry on its commerce it will become prosperous beyond precedent in the history of civilized governments of the world the brains and the wealth of all countries will go to north america that government must be destroyed or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe
9217587 in numerous years following the war the federal government ran a heavy surplus it could not however pay off its debt retire its securities because to do so meant there would be no bonds to back the national bank notes to pay off the debt was to destroy the money supply
9217588 the money power preys upon the nations in times of peace and conspires against it in times of adversity it is more despotic than monarchy more insolent than autocracy more selfish than bureaucracy
9217589 my agency in promoting the passage of the national banking act was the greatest financial mistake in my life it has built up a monopoly which affects every interest in the country
9217590 abraham lincoln the murdered emancipator of the slaves was assassinated through the machinations of a group representative of the international bankers who feared the united states presidents national credit ambitions there was only one group in the world at that time who had any reason to desire the death of lincoln they were the men opposed to his national currency program and who had fought him throughout the whole civil war on his policy of greenback currency
9217591 they were the men interested in the establishment of the gold standard and the right of the bankers to manage the currency and credit of every nation in the world with lincoln out of the way they were able to proceed with that plan and did proceed with it in the united states within 8 years after lincolns assassination silver was demonetized and the gold standard system set up in the united states
9217592 the hard times which occurred after the civil war could have been avoided if the greenback legislation had continued as president lincoln had intended instead there were a series of money panics what we call recessions which put pressure on congress to enact legislation to place the banking system under centralized control eventually the federal reserve act was passed on december 23rd 1913
9217593 i went to america in the winter of 1872 1873 authorized to secure if i could the passage of a bill demonetizing silver it was in the interests of those i represented the governors of the bank of england to have it done by 1873 gold coins were the only form of coin money
9217594 the disaster of the dark ages was caused by decreasing money and falling prices without money civilization could not have had a beginning and with a diminishing supply it must languish and unless relieved finally perish
9217595 it is advisable to do all in your power to sustain such prominent daily and weekly newspapers especially the agricultural and religious press as well as oppose the greenback issue of paper money and that you will also withhold patronage from all applicants who are not willing to oppose the government issue of money to repeal the act creating bank notes or to restore to circulation issue of money will be to provide the people with money and will therefore seriously affect our individual profits as bankers and lenders see your congressman at once and engage him to support our interests that we may control legislation
9217596 the capital of the country is organized at last and we will see whether congress will dare to fly in its face
9217597 whosoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce and when you realize that the entire system is very easily controlled one way or another by a few powerful men at the top you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate
9217598 on september 1st 1894 we will not renew our loans under any consideration on september 1st we will demand our money we will foreclose and become mortgages in possession we can take two thirds of the farms west of the mississippi and thousands of them east of the mississippi as well at our own price then the farmers will become tenants as in england
9217599 we will answer their demand for a gold standard by saying to them you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold
9217600 on the one hand there is the party which holds the power because it holds the wealth which has in its grasp all labor and all trade which manipulates for its own benefit and its own purposes all the sources of supply and which is powerfully represented in the councils of state itself on the other side there is the needy and powerless multitude sore and suffering rapacious usury which although more than once condemned by the church is nevertheless under a different form but with the same guilt still practiced by avaricious and grasping men so that a small number of very rich men have been able to lay upon the masses of the poor a yoke little better than slavery itself
9217601 unless we have a central bank with adequate control of credit resources this country is going to undergo the most severe and far reaching money panic in its history
9217602 all this trouble could be averted if we appointed a committee of six or seven public spirited men like j p morgan to handle the affairs of our country
9217603 i was as secretive indeed as furtive as any conspirator discovery we knew simply must not happen or else all our time and effort would be wasted if it were to be exposed that our particular group had got together and written a banking bill that bill would have no chance whatever of passage by congress
9217604 before passage of this act the new york bankers could only dominate the reserves of new york now we are able to dominate bank reserves of the entire country
9217605 the aldrich plan is the wall street plan it means another panic if necessary to intimidate the people aldrich paid by the government to represent the people proposes a plan for the trusts instead
9217606 baruch brought wilson to the democratic party headquarters in new york in 1912 leading him like one wood a poodle on a string wilson received an indoctrination course from the leaders convened there
9217607 the aldrich bill was condemned in the platform when woodrow wilson was nominated the men who ruled the democratic party promised the people that if they were returned to power there would be no central bank established here while they held the reins of government thirteen months later that promise was broken and the wilson administration under the tutelage of those sinister wall street figures who stood behind colonel house established here in our free country the worm eaten monarchical institution of the kings bank to control us from the top downward and to shackle us from the cradle to the grave
9217608 brushing aside the external differences affecting the shells we find the kernels of the two systems very closely resembling and related to one another
9217609 although the aldrich federal reserve plan was defeated when it bore the name aldrich nevertheless its essential points were all contained in the plan that finally was adopted
9217610 the bill grants just what wall street and the big banks for twenty five years have been striving for private instead of public control of currency it the glass owen bill does this as completely as the aldrich bill both measures rob the government and the people of all effective control over the publics money and vest in the banks exclusively the dangerous power to make money among the people scarce or plenty
9217611 this act establishes the most gigantic trust on earth when the president signs this bill the invisible government of the monetary power will be legalized the people may not know it immediately but the day of reckoning is only a few years removed the worst legislative crime of the ages is perpetrated by this banking and currency bill
9217612 to cause high prices all the federal reserve board will do will be to lower the rediscount rate producing an expansion of credit and a rising stock market then when business men are adjusted to these conditions it can check prosperity in mid career by arbitrarily raising the rate of interest it can cause the pendulum of a rising and falling market to swing gently back and forth by slight changes in the discount rate or cause violent fluctuations by a greater rate variation and in either case it will possess inside information as to financial conditions and advance knowledge of the coming change either up or down this is the strongest most dangerous advantage ever placed in the hands of a special privilege class by any government that ever existed the system is private conducted for the sole purpose of obtaining the greatest possible profits from the use of other peoples money they know in advance when to create panics to their advantage they also know when to stop panic inflation and deflation work equally well for them when they control finance
9217613 already the federal reserve banks have cornered the gold and gold certificates
9217614 we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled governments in the civilized world no longer a government of free opinion no longer a government by a vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men some of the biggest men in the united states in the field of commerce and manufacture are afraid of something they know there is a power somewhere so organized so subtle so watchful so interlocked so complete so pervasive that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it
9217615 if one understands that socialism is not a share the wealth program but it is in reality a method to consolidate and control the wealth then the seeming paradox of super rich men promoting socialism becomes no paradox at all instead it becomes logical even the perfect tool of power seeking megalomaniacs communism or more accurately socialism is not a movement of the downtrodden masses but of the economic elite
9217616 if our nation can issue a dollar bond it can issue a dollar bill the element that makes the bond good makes the bill good also it is absurd to say that our country can issue 30 million dollars in bonds and not 30 million dollars in currency both are promises to pay but one promise fattens the usurers and the other helps the people
9217617 these international bankers and rockefeller standard oil interests control the majority of newspapers and the columns of these newspapers to club into submission or drive out of public office officials who refuse to do the bidding of the powerful corrupt cliques which compose the invisible government
9217618 the warning of theodore roosevelt has much timeliness today for the real menace of our republic is this invisible government which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy length over city state and nation it seizes in its long and powerful tentacles our executive officers our legislative bodies our schools our courts our newspapers and every agency created for the public protection to depart from mere generalizations let me say that at the head of this octopus are the rockefeller standard oil interest and a small group of powerful banking houses generally referred to as international bankers this little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the united states government for their own selfish purposes they practically control both parties write political platforms make cats paws of party leaders use the leading men of private organizations and resort to every device to place in nomination for high public office only such candidates as will be amenable to the dictates of corrupt big business these international bankers and rockefeller standard oil interests control the majority of newspapers and magazines in this country
9217619 the financial system has been turned over to the federal reserve board that board administers the finance system by authority of a purely profiteering group the system is private conducted for the sole purpose of obtaining the greatest possible profits from the use of other peoples money
9217620 i think it can hardly be disputed that the statesmen and financiers of europe are ready to take almost any means to reacquire rapidly the gold stock which europe lost to america as a result of world war i
9217621 at the height of the selling frenzy bernard baruch brought winston churchill into the visitors gallery of the new york stock exchange to witness the panic and impress him with his power over the wild events on the floor
9217622 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
9217623 actually it was the calculated shearing of the public by the world money powers triggered by the planned sudden shortage of call money in the new york money market
9217624 the federal reserve definitely caused the great depression by contracting the amount of currency in circulation by one third from 1929 to 1933
9217625 after world war i germany fell into the hands of the german international bankers those bankers bought her and now they own her lock stock and barrel they have purchased her industries they have mortgages on her soil they control her production they control all her public utilities the international german bankers have subsidized the present government of germany and they have also supplied every dollar of the money adolph hitler has used in his lavish campaign to build up a threat to the government of bruening when bruening fails to obey the orders of the german international bankers hitler is brought forth to scare the germans into submission through the federal reserve board over 30 billion of dollars of american money has been pumped into germany you have all heard of the spending that has taken place in germany modernistic dwellings her great planetariums her gymnasiums her swimming pools her fine public highways her perfect factories all this was done on our money all this was given to germany through the federal reserve board the federal reserve board has pumped so many billions of dollars into germany that they dare not name the total
9217626 the powers of financial capitalism had a far reaching plan nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole this system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences the apex of the system was to be the bank for international settlements in basel switzerland a private bank owned and controlled by the worlds central banks which were themselves private corporations each central bank sought to dominate its government by its ability to control treasury loans to manipulate foreign exchanges to influence the level of economic activity in the country and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world
9217627 we have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known i refer to the federal reserve board this evil institution has impoverished the people of the united states and has practically bankrupted our government it has done this through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it
9217628 practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion rejected by the hearts and minds of men the money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization
9217629 democracy has no more persistent and insidious foe than money power questions regarding bank of england its conduct and its objects are not allowed by the speaker of the house of commons
9217630 through the fed the people are losing their rights guaranteed to them by the constitution common decency requires us to examine the public accounts of the government and see what kind of crimes against the public welfare have been committed the people of these united states are being greatly wronged every effort has been made by the fed to conceal its powers but truth is the fed has usurped the government the sack of these united states by the fed is the greatest crime in history what king ever robbed his subject to such an extent as the fed has robbed us it is a monstrous thing for this great nation of people to have its destinies presided over by a traitorous government board acting in secret concert with international usurer when the fed was passed the people of these united states did not perceive that a world system was being set up here a super state controlled by international bankers and international industrialists acting together to enslave the world for their own pleasure
9217631 the stock of money prices and output was decidedly more unstable after the establishment of the reserve system than before the most dramatic period of instability in output was of course the period between the two wars which includes the severe monetary contractions of 1920 21 1929 33 and 1937 38 no other 20 year period in american history contains as many as three such severe contractions this evidence persuades me that at least a third of the price rise during and just after world war i is attributable to the establishment of the federal reserve system and that the severity of each of the major contractions 1920 21 1929 33 and 1937 38 is directly attributable to acts of commission and omission by the reserve authorities any system which gives so much power and so much discretion to a few men so that mistakes excusable or not can have such far reaching effects is a bad system it is a bad system to believers in freedom just because it gives a few men such power without any effective check by the body politic this is the key political argument against an independent central bank to paraphrase clemenceau money is much too serious a matter to be left to the central bankers
9217632 i know of no severe depression in any country or any time that was not accompanied by a sharp decline in the stock of money and equally of no sharp decline in the stock of money that was not accompanied by a severe depression
9217633 the modern banking system manufactures money out of nothing the process is perhaps the most astounding piece of sleight of hand that was ever invented banking was conceived in iniquity and born in sin bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough money to buy it back again take this great power away from them and all great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for then this would be a better and happier world to live in but if you want to continue to be slaves of the banks and pay the cost of your own slavery then let bankers continue to create money and control credit
9217634 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
9217635 in the united states today we have in effect two governments we have the duly constituted government then we have an independent uncontrolled and uncoordinated government in the federal reserve system operating the money powers which are reserved to congress by the constitution
9217636 allegations of missing gold from our fort knox vaults are being widely discussed in european financial circles but what is puzzling is that the administration is not hastening to demonstrate conclusively that there is no cause for concern over our gold treasure if indeed it is in a position to do so
9217637 the u s treasury owned no gold at all all the gold that was left in fort knox was now owned by the federal reserve a group of private bankers as collateral against the national debt
9217638 lord beswick rose to call attention to the statement made by the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster on 23rd july 1985 that the 96 9 per cent increase in money supply over a five year period has been created by the private banking system and without government authority the noble lord said my lords on 10th june this year i asked her majestys government by what amount the money supply had increased in the five year period to mid april 1985 interestingly they gave me the answer in percentages and not in pounds having given him prior notice perhaps the minister would be good enough later to give me the answer in money terms the government reply on 10th june was that the increase had been by 101 9 per cent and that of that very large amount only 5 per cent was accounted for by the state minting of more coins and the printing of more notes that 96 9 per cent increase represented not only an enormous sum of money but also a crucially important factor in our economy i wanted to know by whom it had been created and on 23rd july i again asked her majestys government to what extent this increase had government approval i was told by the chancellor of the duchy speaking for the government the 96 9 per cent represented new bank deposits created in the normal course of banking business and no government authority is necessary for this had he said that some counterfeiter of coins or forger of notes had been at work there would of course have been an immediate and indignant outcry yet here we have a government statement that private institutions have created this enormous amount of extra purchasing power and we are expected to accept that it is normal practice and that the government authority does not come into it when i asked whether we ought not to consider more deeply who was benefiting from this money creating power the minister said that the implications though interesting were maybe too far reaching for question time and so i raise the matter again in debate and hope to get more enlightenment the issues are important they are certainly under discussed perhaps not adequately understood and i hope that i am not being unduly unfair if i say that those who understand the mechanisms often do very well out of them i make no party point it is all much bigger and wider than that
9217639 we are grateful to the washington post the new york times time magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost 40 years it would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years but the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government the super national sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto determination practiced in past centuries
9217640 straight back into the coffers of western banks in debt service
9217641 the next government must grasp the nettle accept their responsibility for controlling the money supply and change from our debt based monetary system my lords will they if they do not our monetary system will break us and the sorry legacy we are already leaving our children will be a disaster
9217642 one legacy of socialism is that most people continue to believe the state has a fundamental role in promoting development and providing social services
9217643 america cant let us stay in power we are an exception to the new globalization order if we succeed we are an example to all the americas
9217644 for what will it profit men that a more prudent distribution and use of riches make it possible for them to gain even the whole world if thereby they suffer the loss of their own souls what will it profit to teach them sound principles in economics if they permit themselves to be so swept away by selfishness by unbridled and sordid greed that hearing the commandments of the lord they do all things contrary

9217666 by observing the extent of this blurring and modeling how that happens we can work out how long the crystal sits in the magma chamber
9217667 this builds up our picture of the volcanic system and helps work out what a volcano has done in the past as a guide to how it may behave in the future
9217668 seismic detection would depend on the depth timescale and size of an intruding batch of magma
9217669 if the volume is small the chamber deep and the time scale of intrusion slow the intrusion would be hard to detect

9217724 i abhor the very concept of such reality shows and never watch them they are against the basic psyche of a child who is not emotionally stable enough to take either success or failure with maturity
9217725 its an additional baggage thrust upon the kids by the tv channels if they feel the need to derive sadistic pleasure out of someones emotions they should make tragic films not make children cry on national tv
9217726 i want kids to enjoy the simple joys of life
9217727 not being pushed by their parents to fulfil any aspirations
9217728 this view is shared by goldy malhotra principal modern school vasant vihar who says
9217729 i want the kids in my school to follow their dreams and achieve higher grounds if they are talented in some field we advise them on such issues but leave the decision to the family concerned as they have the highest stake i personally dont find anything wrong in the concept of talent hunt per se but only if treated in a cultured and respectful way i strongly detest aping shows like american idol and weakest link that are downright rude and hurtful to the participants
9217730 my nine year old daughter is a fabulous singer i want her to participate in a tv singing competition and display her talent to the whole world if her school doesnt allow her to participate i might consider changing the school
9217731 of course there are some parents and producers that push children into such shows and some shows do treat them badly but there are black sheep in every field and because of one mistake everything shouldnt be banned

9217737 i was amazed by the interest shown by the number of young men who visited our stall during the world book fair
9217738 prompted us to take this precautionary measure to protect public health
9217739 i have to stress we wouldnt do this unless we felt it was the right thing to do on a precautionary basis
9217740 i know it has happened three times in the last three years but all the incidents are actually different
9217741 in this one i hope were acting before there could be any possibility of illness in the community
9217742 if you have gastroenteritis dont return to school or work until you have been symptom free for 48 hours dont visit patients in local hospitals and long term care facilities
9217743 we apologise for inconvenience caused but protecting public health is our highest priority

9217755 when i came back i was the only one living in my area and now theres 20 to 30 new houses in that area
9217756 i believe that its gonna be better than it was before
9217757 because basically where we lived we had 3 000 missing houses so those houses that are gonna come back are gonna be more modern more energy efficient more green
9217758 especially before the flood the concept of sustainability just didnt enter the minds of people here especially in the lower ninth ward
9217759 we have received numerous requests for assistance from local parish shelters and other animal welfare organizations in louisiana

9217761 we are pleased to be able to lend our assistance both in terms of human resources and equipment in disaster relief efforts
9217762 by using our resources strategically and making key connections at the local levels the aspcas disaster response team is able to effectively respond to shelters and animals in need

9217793 no decision has been taken as yet as our priority is to revive indian hockey by re launching the sub junior junior and senior nationals
9217794 we havent decided anything whoever comes out with authority after the courts verdict we will approach them for the conduct of the tournament
9217795 its a rumour that ihf officials have personal stakes in the phl we have nothing to do with the personal issues of an individual we are here to promote indian hockey
9217796 hockey in india will come up in a big way next year and we even have proposals from some state associations for the conduct of some big tourneys

9217799 it is time to move on with life i have another assignment waiting for me and 8230 i wont disclose it now its time to be with my family and two children
9217800 the bureaucracy here is huge and 8230 things work very slowly i dont want to name any individual or organisation but it is bad i think its is very hard to change the system and i am very sure that it is the interest of the shooters in the country that is keeping the sport alive
9217801 the future is bright because of the shooters not for any other reason the circumstances are bad id just say that indian shooters are very serious about their careers because they know there is no power to back them
9217802 she is a great shooter but doesnt have a strong hand and 8230 the way she is doing now she will never become a champion
9217803 the coach who invited flak for being selective in his coaching clarified it was not the case
9217804 if you have 68 shooters to coach you cannot devote quality time to everyone
9217805 it feels great to qualify for the semi finals as this is out first tournament in the new season we had very little time for practice but the team is doing well the defence needs a bit more stability but we are working on it

9217817 we are confident that parliament is the only solution for the current problems which we will discuss thoroughly tomorrow
9217818 we want to pressure the government to arrest the protesters and clear them out of government house
9217819 the coalition partners have the impression that the situation is deteriorating and we are thinking of telling the prime minister to decide on the future of the government

9217831 i have town hall meetings all over the country all of the time and i know how people are hurting
9217832 i dont think americans are too concerned that my father in law was able to achieve the great american success story they want to stay in their own homes
9217833 first of all i think a lot of them know i spent 51 2 years in a lot of anxiety and pain
9217834 and i didnt have a kitchen table and i didnt have a chair
9217835 i was just talking to some people in ohio where they continue to lose jobs they continue to lose their homes
9217836 ive got to give them a specific and strong plan of action
9217837 in difficult times weve had a bush administration and voters want change
9217838 ive got to make a convincing case that i represent the right kind of change based on my record and outlining a strong agenda
9217839 sure i do sure i do and its a documented fact that it was the dnc that went after me first and the 527s political groups and the unions
9217840 but the fact is people should have a sense of humor
9217841 let me say sen obama made a choice about iraq and he chose to say the surge wouldnt work he said it would fail he got the nomination in large degree by going to the far left of his party on iraq
9217842 i chose the path which was least popular im not questioning his patriotism im questioning his judgment and i will continue to question his judgment and his qualifications to lead
9217843 what i hear from everybody i know is that i dont talk about it enough
9217844 people keep saying to me talk about it more we need to hear your personal story how you made a choice for your country when you refused to come home early i think that sen obama has a great story to tell and certainly i dont begrudge him telling it
9217845 theyre not going to speak theyre not going to do any politicking or campaigning theyre just part of our family and its appropriate for our family be there
9217846 both of them are on duty so theyll be leaving right after the convention is over back to their duties
9217847 sure im nervous particularly given the fact that sen obama is probably the greatest speaker of our time
9217848 its kind of frustrating sitting here and seeing these guys battle and claw for nine innings
9217849 itll be good to back in and battle with these guys
9217850 what counts is how you play in the regular season
9217851 based on the look they gave us defensively yeah kevin did a nice job on that he made a great throw and chad ran a good route
9217852 yeah its not something i couldve done three weeks ago but im getting the opportunities in practice and trying to come out and apply that in games
9217853 learning from tom brady and the other quarterbacks and then getting my opportunities and applying it
9217854 its a stressful time of year for a lot of people
9217855 but i know that ive worked hard and played hard
9217856 well have to figure out how we want to manage the roster
9217857 thatll certainly be one of the decisions the qb position
9217858 kind of both you never know whats going to happen especially with bill belichick
9217859 in the united states we simply have not figured out how to fit the pieces together for a coordinated package that puts people on bikes

9217865 if you fly over the border and look on the colombian side all you see is coca crops
9217866 while the ecuadorean side is nothing but thick jungle with cocaine labs hidden under the canopy
9217867 its no trouble for a colombian to become an ecuadorean
9217868 you can buy an ecuadorean id card for about 70 90 depending how fast you need it
9217869 lago agrio has been a center of rendezvous supply and refuge for the farc
9217870 basically any industry where youve got workers out in the middle of nowhere
9217871 if you see a fire and have no connectivity you cant tell anybody

9217941 she is really just a mayor from a small town outside anchorage who has been a governor for only 1
9217942 she is very very conservative and far from perfect shes a hunter and fisherwoman but votes against the environment again and again she ran on ethics reform but is currently under investigation for several charges involving hiring and firing of state officials she has no experience beyond alaska
9217943 as an alaskan and a feminist i am beyond words at this announcement palin is not a feminist and she is not the reformer she claims to be
9217944 alaskans collectively are just as stunned as the rest of the nation she is doing well running our state but is totally inexperienced on the national level and very much unequipped to run the nation if it came to that she is as far right as one can get which has already been communicated on the news in our office of thirty employees dems republicans and nonpartisans not one person feels she is ready for the v p position
9217945 shes vehemently anti choice and doesnt care about protecting our natural resources even though she has worked as a fisherman mccain chose her to pick up the hillary voters but palin is no hillary

9218236 were hopeful with the dusting which is something new were doing now well be able to at least contain the extent of this plague
9218237 even with the loss of almost 10 000 acres of prairie dogs conata basin still remains the largest and most important prairie dog complex on federal lands in the great plains its worth all these efforts to save it
9218238 theres the plague and the prairie dogs and thats nature taking care of the expansion
9218239 i think we want to get along we want to be able to survive just the same as the prairie dogs want to survive we dont want to annihilate them we dont just get them under control so theyre not sick give the ferrets something healthy to eat

9218309 an optimist who is now in possession of all the facts
9218310 and it appears in our books that in many cases the common law will controul acts of parliament and sometimes adjudge them to be utterly void for when an act of parliament is against common right and reason or repugnant or impossible to be performed the common law will controul it and adjudge such act to be void
9218311 for us an act of parliament duly passed by lords and commons and assented to by the king is supreme and we are bound to give effect to its terms
9218312 bind itself as to the form of subsequent legislation and it is impossible for parliament to enact that in a subsequent statute dealing with the same subject matter there can be no implied repeal
9218313 parliament is supreme it can enact extraordinary powers of interfering with personal liberty if an act of parliament is alleged to limit or curtail the liberty of the subject or vest in the executive extraordinary powers the only question is what is the precise extent of the powers given
9218314 in the present state of its maturity the common law has come to
9218315 this development of the common law regarding constitutional rights and as i would say constitutional statutes is highly beneficial it gives us most of the benefits of a written constitution in which fundamental rights are accorded special respect but it preserves the sovereignty of the legislature and the flexibility of our uncodified constitution it accepts the relation between legislative supremacy and fundamental rights is not fixed or brittle rather the courts in interpreting statutes and now applying the hra will pay more or less deference to the legislature or other public decision maker according to the subject in hand nothing is plainer than that this benign development involves as i have said the recognition of the eca as a constitutional statute
9218316 there is nothing in the eca which allows the court of justice or any other institutions of the eu to touch or qualify the conditions of parliaments legislative supremacy in the united kingdom not because the legislature chose not to allow it because by our law it could not allow it

9218326 for bush and republican presidential candidate john mccain gustav threatens to provide an untimely reminder of hurricane katrina a new major storm along the gulf coast would renew memories of one of the low points of the bush administration while pulling public attention away from mccains formal coronation as the gop presidential nominee

9218570 it got to a point where the money was too much for what we wanted to pay
9218571 we thought we had made a considerable offer but when there was the threat of an offer sheet at such an exaggerated dollar amount it really led us to believe that making a deal was an easier way and would give us the return that we needed for this player
9218572 im extremely happy to be heading to tampa bay and i cant wait to take advantage of this opportunity we should have a great team and i can not wait to get started
9218573 andrej is a perfect fit within our plan to rebuild the lightning into a contender
9218574 he has a strong all around game he competes he moves the puck and he can handle big strong forwards defensively
9218575 perhaps most importantly were pleased to add a 22 year old player with almost 250 nhl games already under his belt we know andrej will continue to grow and improve as he matures with the rest of our defence
9218576 i think the locker room issues were overstated maybe in the past but very definitely our room the type of team we have now the character of the team now could not be questioned at all
9218577 i think meszaros is one of those guys that we were hoping would grow up but by moving him out and bringing in two other guys that are target people really upgrades what we needed in the room
9218578 i thought his first year in ottawa was real good i though his last two years left something to be desired
9218579 i was hoping i could convince him to take a contract thats fair and reasonable so he could really develop into the player we hoped he could be but that wasnt in the books
9218580 really quiet but a real good player he can play the point on the power play and shoots the puck really well
9218581 today it is very difficult to predict if a film will have a broader audience
9218582 their presence this year reflects as has just been demonstrated at the cannes festival that our cinema is returning to levels of excellence
9218583 for us what is really very refreshing is the fact that we in venice can present a wide spectrum of all the possible roads open to italian cinema we have filmmakers who are very diverse
9218584 because on screen they would become magnified almost unbearable to watch
9218585 man what a session we had a fantastic car and im happy we go the pole

9218589 the rain is not so intense but there is a lot a lot of wind
9218590 the officials they have told us the wind will be bad first but then the rain could cause flooding into the night
9218591 its very big and weve got to get ready for whats coming
9218592 i think that definitely the wimbledon win helped me a lot to change my mentality to realize not every thing has to be perfect all the time

9218594 if i can get my racket on the ball its not too bad
9218595 im a tall guy as well its up near my shoulders where other guys its toward their head against a guy like him theres a sense of urgency to every point especially when hes serving

9218597 it is my duty as a head of government to express to you in the name of the italian people our regret and apologies for the deep wounds that we have caused you
9218598 the accord will provide for 200 million dollars a year over the next 25 years through investments in infrastructure projects in libya
9218599 this agreement should put an end to 40 years of discord it is a concrete and moral acknowledgement of the damage inflicted on libya by italy during the colonial era
9218600 this is an historic moment when two brave men acknowledge the defeat of colonialism
9218601 the libyan people endured injustice and were attacked in their homes and they deserve an apology and compensation
9218602 a sudden burst of dignity humanity and respect so as to finally give satisfaction to the 20 000 italian citizens who are still waiting for fair compensation from their government
9218603 at no moment did spanair indicate that it was its intention to substitute the plane
9218604 informed the airport of the possibility of replacing the aircraft but eventually decided to stick with the aircraft that crashed
9218605 after an initial evaluation of the detected glitch and the estimated time for its repair maintenance technicians decided that it would not be necessary to switch planes as it was a minor repair that would take no more than 15 minutes

9218616 this is why nigeria is selling strategically placed portions of land that are well worth fighting to retain to rhodesians and boers this is why the british government are being asked to take charge of certain mining operations why vast portions of future hydro carbon products have being sold off to foreigners and why the nigerian military leadership is being decimated in preparation for the arrival of british military advisers who will oversee the emergence of a new crop of more reliable tools within the nigerian military some members of the nigerian ruling class have decided that voluntary i e tactical suicide is the best way at this moment in time to safeguard all that they have fraudulently acquired

9218624 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9218625 palin has more executive level decision making and governing experience in two years than obama and biden do combined
9218626 she saw something that she thought was wrong and she wanted to see it righted
9218627 democrats rejected a woman obama could have picked one but he bypassed hillary look what has happened for all the talk of a new kind of politics he chose biden
9218628 he told her she would be a terrific candidate and that he looked forward to seeing her on the campaign trail
9218629 he also wished her good luck but not too much luck
9218630 i had a real problem with my radio the cable fell down and started blocking the chain so i couldnt pedal properly
9218631 i think if i hadnt had that problem i would have opened up a gap of over a minute i was focussed i was in good shape but i couldnt go all out
9218632 having thomas behind meant i felt pretty secure in any case
9218633 the weather was perfect too for me 30 degrees i like riding in that kind of heat
9218634 i knew my form was good after the recent results ive had
9218635 but its great to be able to take a win like this
9218636 my aim is to keep the lead all the way through to the end of the race rather than lend the jersey to another rider and then try to come back later
9218637 i know itll be difficult but my form is good and i know i can count on some great support
9218638 we are aware of this bug and plan to deliver a fix in the next software update
9218639 for now users can avoid the problem by changing their setting so that double clicking the home button goes to home or ipod
9218640 id dropped back on the climb and we were riding in a line for the descent when the crash happened
9218641 my wheel slid i went into them and i came off the bike it was a narrow road really there wasnt anything i could do
9218642 obviously after that i wanted to get back on as quickly as possible afterwards for the finish and my team mates worked really hard to get me back into position with about 10 kilometres to go
9218643 the group ahead were going all out so we had to give it a lot just to pull back the gap
9218644 in fact it was the easiest of the three stages ive won form wise im feeling better than i have done all week
9218645 im not planning to watch this game thread aug 30 braves at nationals
9218646 i think that in the last couple of years people are starting to be aware that if they have these units in their car people can keep track of you
9218647 i think its a growing public awareness the problem is that most people feel like im not doing anything wrong so who cares but i think thats the wrong way of looking at it
9218648 youre moving with your auntie and your uncle in bel air
9218649 this marks the beginning of a new epoch the likes of which we have never witnessed before
9218650 it is analysis that strikes me as having borne no resemblance to the speech you and i just watched
9218651 espero igualar o marcador do confronto ela jogou bem desta vez
9218652 a col mbia forte em casa e est invicta a equipe empatou com o brasil e venceu a argentina al m de levar poucos gols e estar acima de n s na classifica o
9218653 j o equador uma boa equipe que talvez tenha pago caro o pre o de um mau in cio nas eliminat rias das equipes que est o abaixo de n s eles ainda podem se recuperar
9218654 fizemos alguns ajustes na parte final do treino e consegui fazer a pole tentei fazer mais uma volta r pida mas vacilei na curva e bati o que importa a pole a minha primeira na categoria
9218655 neste come o de segundo turno temos uma situa o de confrontos com equipes que est o pr ximas ou atr s de n s portuguesa figueirense n utico e ipatinga tamb m vamos enfrentar o s o paulo em casa e para esses cinco jogos a gente faz um planejamento inicial de buscar o m ximo de pontos poss vel
9218656 por isso trabalho com a possibilidade de n o repetir a equipe do gre nal nesse caso tem o lado mais desumano que as pessoas s vezes n o entendem e que eu como profissional e ex jogador conhe o bem refiro me a jogar com menos de 66 horas e depois de praticamente atravessar o pa s
9218657 tem a quest o f sica mas preciso repetir procurar sincronizar pois se trata de um campeonato muito dif cil em que o entrosamento fundamental
9218658 vamos jogar com um time muito equilibrado em todos os setores e com marlos carlinhos para ba e jo o henrique tendo total liberdade para encostarem no keirrison quando estivermos com a posse de bola mais importante do que com quem entraremos em campo como entraremos em campo diante do cruzeiro n o podemos ter afoba o temos que for ar o erro do nosso advers rio
9218659 na verdade a gente estava meio acostumado a jogar sem o thiago est sendo assim desde que ele foi convocado para as olimp adas acho que n o teremos problema no cl ssico
9218660 o thiago neves j foi ele passado nosso elenco tem jogadores qualificados que s o capazes de substitu lo a altura
9218661 por um lado a gente fica triste porque ele um grande amigo mas a gente fica feliz em saber que ele vai para uma melhor sobre quem vai entrar no seu lugar temos o conca e o tart que podem suprir a aus ncia do thiago
9218662 no voy a insistir en la renuncia porque me he enterado que est corriendo obligatoriamente unas firmas de adhesi n as han llegado a mi despacho algunos trabajadores a decir que algunas personas est n presionando para obtener las firmas de adhesi n y no se trata de eso yo no quiero eso de ninguna manera
9218663 sigo se alando que hay una responsabilidad pedag gica en mi amigo idel vexler porque la amistad no se altera por una observaci n a una gesti n publica es responsable as hay que tomarlo
9218664 lo m s importante es que haya la correcci n del caso y no hay que politizar el tema no vamos al asunto personal de si me quieren quitar mi asiento mi puesto eso no es una respuesta de fondo

9218687 im very happy i knew it was a tough match
9218688 i will just focus on my next match because every match is difficult hes playing very well i will have to play very well if i want to advance
9218689 i had a good passing shot on a break point that gave me a lot of confidence that i could win
9218690 i won the first set that was cool after the first set i was pretty pumped up
9218691 ive gotten a lot better since then he has too so i can go out there and rip away i have nothing to lose
9218692 if its like katrina they might not let us back
9218693 they might put a fence around the whole parish and say go away
9218694 he said a bunch of the kids over there was crying and saying they may not come back
9218695 i mean my house is not even finished and then what its going to float away again
9218696 i was hoping to get all the way right at least before another hurricane came and ate up my world
9218697 if i would have been in my house for a day it would have been ok then i could have dealt with it
9218698 i dont have a car i had to come with my neighbors
9218699 but i wasnt going to wait not after katrina these things can be killers we know it now youd have to be a fool not to get out while the gettings good
9218700 we watched katrina from the cockpit of a 19 foot sailboat
9218701 thats what we do we rebuild thats the nature of mankind
9218702 katrina was hell there is a reason to have anxiety
9218703 weve paid our dues as far as im concerned i know its selfish but thats the way it is
9218704 in the event that hurricane gustav forces us to evacuate the team will temporarily relocate to indianapolis
9218705 if an evacuation is called for we will fly to indianapolis at that time and stay there for the entire week preparing for the bucs we will practice at lucas oil stadium and we will return to new orleans on friday
9218706 that is what we wanted to see that was the important thing
9218707 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9218708 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9218709 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9218710 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9218711 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9218712 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9218713 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9218714 who are open to doing something on the production side
9218715 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9218716 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9218717 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9218718 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9218719 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9218720 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9218721 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9218722 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9218723 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9218724 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9218725 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9218726 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9218727 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9218728 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

9218733 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9218734 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9218735 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9218736 cannot rule out an active day night what with the moisture and instability now in place
9218737 if you have any problems dont hesitate to call 911
9218738 check on your loved ones the elderly who may be shut in who may not have power they need water they need to be out of the heat
9218739 our priority obviously is to get everything out of the streets so that the traveling public can get through
9218740 weve got some areas that are flooded were trying to get those pumped out as quickly as we can poles that are down in the street were clearing those
9218741 our radar picked up 80 to 100 mile per hour winds just a little bit off the ground
9218742 rainfall was on the order of half an inch of rain in five to 10 minutes really high rainfall rates pretty unusual for around here
9218743 weve lived here since 1970 and it was probably the most severe thunderstorm weve had
9218744 the wind was really blowing and it was a torrential downpour
9218745 i just heard a noise around 10 15 or so
9218746 it punched a hole in the roof and theres some branches sticking between the roof and the ceiling and theres a hole in the ceiling of a bedroom
9218747 we planted that tree in 1976 it was our first christmas tree in this house so were pretty sad about losing it
9218748 we had very very strong winds heavy rain all takeoffs and landings were halted for about an hour and 15 minutes last night
9218749 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9218750 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9218751 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9218752 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9218753 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9218754 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9218755 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9218756 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9218757 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9218758 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

9218761 miljoenen amerikanen en dan niet alleen vrouwen en republikeinen hebben een gevoel gekregen van energie plezier en trots niet alleen vanwege de nominatie zelf maar ook vanwege de spetterende openingsact palin zal een aansprekend voorbeeld zijn veel amerikanen die dag in dag uit te horen krijgen dat een beetje conservatief of een beetje religieus al verkeerd is palin kan een inspirerende figuur worden en een krachtig symbool links amerika voelt dit en daarom zijn ze al direct begonnen om haar de diskrediteren
9218762 zij is tegen belastingverhoging hij is voor zij is voor olieboren voor de amerikaanse kust biden is tegen meer amerikaanse olie als je echte verandering wil reken dan op palin mccains keuze voor palin is een stap in de richting van echte verandering in washington elke hervormer en elke hillary supporter heeft nu eens kans om het verraad van hun hoop te stoppen en om voor echte hervormingen en echte kansen voor vrouwen te stemmen

9218768 yes i think the iphone has a lot of potential as a gaming platform but the lack of traditional game controls is making for some interesting experimentation among game developers right now
9218769 to the man with a hammer everything looks like a nail
9218770 there is a lot of room for improvement as far as organization goes but really nothing like the app store ever existed before that makes it so easy for developers to distribute their products and for customers to buy the product i had considered doing development for mobile devices for several years but it wasnt until the opportunity to be on the app store came around that i finally took the plunge the app store is revolutionary for software distribution for software developers its the great equalizer i suppose
9218771 building software for the iphone is a rare opportunity for developers let me explain what i mean ive been writing software since the early 1980s back then it was a whole different world the industry of software for personal computers was very immature products for the appple ii trs 80 and atari home computers were frequently built by single developers and often sold in ziploc bags it was a real cowboy type of atmosphere but it was very exciting because there was a feeling that anybody could build the next great product and this in fact was true it was a beginning time and it was exciting this is when companies like ea got started and their initial products were indeed built by single developers working alone developers like bill budge pinball construction set and will harvey music construction set but now we have this exciting new platform the iphone and ipod touch and i feel the same excitement the same sense that anybody can build the next great product we have thousands of individual developers working alone and furiously coding new apps trying to score a hit i believe that out of these efforts we will the next generation of large software companies emerge the next eas if you will it something i want to be part of and frankly this is the first time computers have excited me in years

9219001 it is by the apostolic preaching of the gospel that the people of god is called together and gathered so that all who belong to this people sanctified as they are by the holy spirit may offer themselves a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to god rom 12 1
9219002 through baptism all of us have been made priests of our lives to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god through jesus christ 1 pet 2 5 everything we do can be an expression of our obedience to gods will and so perpetuate the mission of the god man
9219003 if the oblation whereby the faithful in this sacrifice offer the divine victim to the heavenly father is to produce its full effect they must also offer themselves as victim desiring intensely to make themselves as like as possible to jesus christ who suffered so much and offering themselves as a spiritual victim with and through the high priest himself
9219004 if i renounce everything i possess if i carry the cross and follow christ i have offered a holocaust on the altar of god or if i burn up my body in the fire of charity i have offered a holocaust on the altar of god if i mortify my body and abstain from all concupiscence if the world is crucified unto me and not me unto the world then i have offered a holocaust on the altar of god and i am become a priest of my own sacrifice

9219050 im afraid that we may have to look at that situation and well try to monitor it
9219051 but you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too

9219053 my gut says that the convention gets gaveled open for sure but theres no question that this is a big issue that convention planners are im sure as we speak thinking about
9219054 the chief executives are sort of the key stars in this party so their presence will be missed here as we get ready to start this convention
9219055 its never been done because the issues have been too big to surmount
9219056 the most diplomatic way of saying it is that there are just a lot of moving parts

9219064 our aim is for every single school to welcome children from all backgrounds it is a simple goal strongly supported by the public educationalists and students
9219065 there are those who attend church in order that their children qualify for admission to a particular school and never set foot in the church again after the children have been accepted
9219066 all children regardless of their religion culture and family income should have equal access to the best possible education in a good local school
9219067 allowing schools to pick and choose pupils is not the best way to achieve this or to create young adults with the confidence and personal skills to live and work in our vibrant multi cultural society
9219068 parents should be able to choose the type of education and ethos they want for their children the bottom line is that faith schools are successful thriving popular and here to stay
9219069 it is down to locally accountable councils and communities themselves not some campaign group to decide what sort of schools they should have
9219070 given the dangers of segregation and the importance of community cohesion we need schools that welcome all and are committed to non discrimination

9219213 if this were a 1973 monte carlo which its not instead of the 1992 volvo wagon that we have i would right now be looking at a dashboard rendered entirely in matte black
9219214 i think hes leaning against having the surgery but were still evaluating that
9219215 there are always going to be what i call expletive storms
9219216 there can be problems and i would rather have faced them before we get them than wait until we get them then try to get through them
9219217 we make the best out of whats out there so lets practice it
9219218 i dont want to say i dont worry about it that i discount what jeff has done
9219219 but weve got a number of guys who can play that position and well be fine
9219220 someone will emerge howard will figure out whats going to be best it may not be whos the best center but whats best for the whole group
9219221 twenty five years ago they said you just put another guy in there
9219222 but its not as easy as a lot of people think now people understand the importance of continuity especially when you have a guy like jeff saturday whos so accomplished
9219223 the philosopher is not an apologist apologetic concern as karl barth the one living theologian of unquestionable genius has rightly insisted is the death of serious theologizing and i would add equally of serious work in the philosophy of religion
9219224 were trying to get into his head were having fun with it every chance i get i say something to him
9219225 it would mean a lot there is a lot of pressure going on at the moment you want to get it done
9219226 as everyone always says your first win you never forget
9219227 every time i come over here i never forget about that it was a very special moment but that was the past and now we need to focus on the business of what we need to do this weekend
9219228 i like to go after it i like to push it as the hunted you have pressure and if you make a mistake its going to play into the hands of the hunter

9219230 the car that we used for sonoma was actually the car that we were supposed to use for detroit
9219231 we had to convert it for sonoma and then convert it back for here the good news is we know we have a good car
9219232 weve got to concentrate on just getting the job done
9219233 theres no point in concentrating on helio or any of the others theres a whole field there that weve got to beat

9219237 thats not to say that tattoos are a bad thing in any way but its a very permanent thing someday you may feel differently
9219238 is that it might be very desirable at that particular point in time but that they may regret it at a later point tattoo removal besides being very costly leaves some scarring
9219239 i think many times with kids teens and very young adults their thought processes are all about immediate future tomorrow is the only thing that really matters but they are making decisions that have permanent consequences
9219240 wait a little bit see how you feel in a few months if you feel strongly about it then start looking into it a little more with some people its almost a compulsion i would say take a deep breath wait and see how you feel in a few months
9219241 its a way of paying tribute of letting people know that these people were important in their lives
9219242 some people have bumper stickers on their cars that might be one way people make donations others make dedications there are a variety of ways to pay tribute
9219243 id say its about 20 to 30 percent of my business
9219244 it keeps a memory alive they dont want to forget them and they think it does them honor when they put something permanent on their bodies
9219245 its just more of a younger urban type of kids who are doing it now

9219257 thats the lowest vote of confidence in a running mate since the elder george bush chose then indiana senator dan quayle to join his ticket in 1988
9219258 in comparison delaware sen joe biden was seen as qualified by 57 18 after democrat barack obama chose him as a running mate last week
9219259 well first of all we have a candidate in john mccain who knows an awful lot about foreign policy and national security
9219260 he knows a lot hes been spending a lot of time with her she has met every challenge in her life shes a smart intelligent capable able tough woman and i am convinced that she is going to make a great candidate and she will be up to speed necessary
9219261 the problem is that politics like all professions isnt as easy as it looks
9219262 palins odds of emerging unscathed this fall are slim in fact shes been all but set up for failure
9219263 the smartest person in the world could not prepare quickly enough to know the pitfalls and to sound confident while doing so on all the issues she will be forced to address
9219264 this is long before she gets to a debate with biden its what the press is going to start out looking for
9219265 into battle against long odds on such big local issues as oil taxes and construction of a natural gas pipeline only to see her opposition crumble
9219266 days after her 2006 primary victory an fbi investigation into political corruption involving the oil industry and republican legislators burst into view with surprise raids of legislative offices criminal indictments and convictions followed often just in time for the headlines to help her win another contest in juneau
9219267 i think there will probably be a tendency for the democrats to do the same thing
9219268 they will assume that her lack of experience on the national stage will put her at a disadvantage and im not certain that will matter
9219269 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9219270 we have addressed emergency plans in each location and have contacted high acuity patients to make sure they are safe and understand their own evacuation plans
9219271 we have also connected those patients with other locations around the region we have contacted all our oxygen patients and explained to them that we have set up at least 12 depots in local towns where they can come by and get supplies if needed
9219272 with the lessons we learned from katrina and other hurricanes we feel that we are prepared to handle anything that is thrown at us

9219344 theres no doubt that alaskans right now are dealing in an atmosphere of distrust of government and industry
9219345 it is a governors prerogative a right to fill that cabinet with members whom she or he believes will do best for the people whom we are serving

9219358 this storm has the potential for being a very dangerous storm
9219359 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
9219360 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
9219361 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
9219362 we dont foresee any sanctions decided on by the european council
9219363 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia
9219364 we did have lots of contacts with georgia over a long period of time
9219365 georgia found it too hard to hold that line when they were seeing what russia was preparing to do
9219366 every day they threaten me and want to drive me out of ossetia
9219367 it was a concerted action of russian official military forces together with paramilitaries
9219368 they aim at pushing georgians out of their villages to make sure they have no place to return to
9219369 emphasize the need for russian authorities to hold these militias accountable
9219370 we will not leave georgian houses orchards nothing we will erase them from the face of earth
9219371 for the socially conscious crew in their formative work years new orleans definitely tops the list
9219372 im pretty sure that 10 years ago the city didnt have students from yale interning here but thats one of the really great and fascinating things about new orleans its always been wonderful but its on peoples radar now
9219373 i was waking up from nightmares where i was in the same office doing the same thing at 65
9219374 the upwardly mobile transplants must remember that new orleans is different from ny seattle sf or chicago many say the new new orleanian is what this city needs to survive i say the city its displaced and returned have done more for us than weve done for them
9219375 i think its hugely important for us post storm transplants to take time to reflect on how fortunate we are to be able to pack up and move from eugene oregon or new york or wherever and be down here two weeks later with enough money for a deposit and first months rent
9219376 i guess you have to have that make a difference mentality but maybe it should be the kind of thing that burns within not the way you introduce yourself to your new neighbors
9219377 people would ask me whats your connection to the city
9219378 it was almost as though they were saying you dont belong here this is just for show and in some cases i think that was right there were people here like that i just came down here to throw myself into the work
9219379 she encouraged me to get out of my comfort zone
9219380 i dont want to say anything bad about our school because the administration was one of the best
9219381 we had really strong support from the principal and the vice principal but we were just overloaded i had no way of knowing the extent of the inequities we would be facing
9219382 and even then we had to buy our own paper
9219383 sprinkled into that were just normal kindergarten boys testing their boundaries and getting into trouble
9219384 that realization that things arent always so rose colored is really disheartening but in the end it hasnt changed the way i do my job so now its just part of my motivation to do something about it
9219385 i feel like im part of a team now and you dont want to let anyone on the team down
9219386 people in boston and new york they feel like maybe they ought to be moving down here too
9219387 this is just such an adventurous place its almost like a study abroad experience something that wouldnt be possible anywhere else on the planet
9219388 my girlfriend says it was the right things to do but i dont know its not like i could have saved my property but just to see it for myself live not on tv because maybe it wasnt as bad
9219389 i remember telling my parents at the time i hope my car gets some family far away from this horrible place
9219390 i had needed and wanted to come back to new orleans
9219391 i often wonder about this tidal wave of outside talent thats come down
9219392 not just foot soldiers but all this outside expertise the superintendent the recovery director for whom five years is a long time because this thing is going to be way longer than five years what happens when outside influx starts to wane whats going to happen 15 years from now
9219393 hopefully enough people will have fallen in love and stayed

9219425 und ich will euch ein eintr chtiges herz geben und einen neuen geist in euch geben und will das steinerne herz wegnehmen aus eurem leibe und ein fleischernes herz geben
9219426 und ich will meinen geist in euch geben da ihr wieder leben sollt und will euch in euer land setzen und sollt erfahren da ich der herr bin jch rede es und tue es auch spricht der herr

9219452 jamaican artistes do have a lot of respect for zimbabwe this follows lucianos visit last year where he came and saw for himself the situation on the ground
9219453 i met luciano in england a few weeks ago and he still wants to make the comeback
9219454 the messenger has also called upon our political leaders to reach a settlement for the good for the nation
9219455 he also told me that his first visit inspired fellow artistes to want to come to zimbabwe
9219456 in fact lucianos visit influenced more jamaicans to have a lot of interest about zimbabwe some of these artistes include sizzla capelton bushman richie spice among other artistes
9219457 jamaican musicians seem to have realised the potential that music has in uniting the two countries and that is the reason why many jamaicans are curios to come here

9219461 stalled apparently when another club also expressed serious interest in the 2006 world series most valuable player the rays and red sox may be among the teams interested in eckstein the dodgers who also need depth in the infield are among the teams monitoring the situation although a deal is considered a longshot

9219463 only about 4 of the total energy density in the universe as inferred from gravitational effects can be seen directly
9219464 i think that in the last couple of years people are starting to be aware that if they have these units in their car people can keep track of you
9219465 i think its a growing public awareness the problem is that most people feel like im not doing anything wrong so who cares but i think thats the wrong way of looking at it

9219468 everyone has gone out to give it all trying not to lose it on the bends
9219469 the important thing was to avoid falling we lost 14 seconds to liquigas and its not bad its been a good spectacle for a first stage
9219470 im not so surprised we won weve got a good team here for short punchy stages like this one
9219471 we checked out the course this morning saw it suited us and decided to go all out astana were running us close halfway through the stage but we pulled out all the stops in the second half
9219472 this victory here in spain belongs to the team not just to me we all worked hard for it
9219473 but its also my first lead in a major tour and thats a great feeling
9219474 the world championships are in italy on sept 28 so theyre naturally a big target for me and the tour of spain is the perfect warm up thats why im here
9219475 we didnt want to take any risks this race is three weeks long and this is just the start
9219476 more than winning today the objective was not to lose too much time compared to the other contenders and not to fall off and thats what happened
9219477 running a bit ahead of last years renewals which were the strongest in three seasons
9219478 were not the most expensive ticket in town by any means and weve worked really hard to keep our ticket prices affordable
9219479 in the past we usually have one big hit per season and weve already had two so far
9219480 people need and seek pleasure diversion classic or novel entertainment
9219481 they tell us that in person and i think through their attendance
9219482 we will end the year fairly close to our projections in total but we are finding that the usually unpredictable habits of our audience are even more unpredictable
9219483 i dont know if any of us has a clear idea of what it will be come fall
9219484 the trend is that were going up the ladder scaling up
9219485 this is the new reality of performing arts they simply need more cash flow to make it work especially with fewer subscribers and more single ticket buyers the higher production costs the need to spend money earlier in the season for marketing and the struggle with deficits all make it challenging
9219486 we need to budget conservatively stay clearly on mission and strive for excellence
9219487 those are the ingredients for longevity and stability with rewards of many kinds
9219488 the thing to remember is that the difficulties facing foundations and corporations will show up more next year

9219496 no hay nada concreto respecto de la posibilidad de que el vicepresidente conforme una l nea pol tica propia si bien siente el cari o de la gente que le pide que conozca el pa s e impulse proyectos viables para cada lugar para ello es necesario que tome conocimiento de lo que est pasando en nuestra zona m s all de hablar de espacios pol ticos no es el momento apropiado para tomar ese tipo de decisiones
9219497 como intendente de villarino le habl de la necesidad de construir un acueducto para el sector norte del distrito desde el r o colorado tambi n le dej en claro que nuestro distrito no produce soja y que por lo tanto necesita una pol tica diferenciada al igual que todo el sudoeste bonaerense donde llueve muy poco
9219498 no tengo problemas en decirlo le di mi apoyo somos muchos los que no queremos que cobos abandone el barco y por eso lo apoyamos para que siga cumpliendo con su funci n p blica manteniendo la independencia que lo caracteriza
9219499 nosotros queremos aportar nuestro granito de arena porque despu s de carlos pellegrini ning n vicepresidente se jug como lo hizo cobos
9219500 estamos trabajando en un armado institucional m s que en uno pol tico si bien somos conscientes de que eso tendr consecuencias de tipo pol tico por ello seguramente se realizar una invocaci n plural que exceda el cauce de lo partidario adem s se est trabajando para que se reconsidere la expulsi n de cobos y otros gobernadores de la ucr a fin de que puedan volver al partido radical
9219501 con su rechazo a las retenciones cobos tuvo un gesto radical e hizo lo que precisaba el pa s independientemente de la sugerencia que su cointegrante de f rmula la presidenta cristina de kirchner pudiera haber hecho por esto anhelamos que el d a de ma ana dentro del cauce institucional est represent ndonos a los radicales en un cargo alto
9219502 estamos esperando la confirmaci n de los intendentes de puan horacio l pez y de salliquel osvaldo enrique catt neo

9219522 in my eyes we have a great situation here momentum is the key ganassi has been having a fantastic year but finally theyre starting to show some signs of weakness we hope they continue showing that
9219523 we had to convert it for sonoma and then convert it back for here the good news is we know we have a good car

9219526 parental leave policies in 21 countries assessing generosity and gender equality
9219527 when leave is transferable there is a greater likelihood that couples and companies alike will fall back on 1950s gender roles with mothers expected to take all of the time and fathers expected to take none
9219528 but since most men and women are now equally capable employees we should allow them to become equally capable parents
9219529 while the united states does a better job than many countries in allowing both men and women to utilize family leaves it also forces both men and women to make hard choices between their need to have income coming in and their need to spend time with their newborns
9219530 families need both time and money especially after the birth of a child
9219531 done properly parental leave policies arent a drag on the economy for example of the 19 rich countries with paid parental leave nine have an unemployment rate as low or lower than the united states

9219533 our members and retirees at arcelormittal now have the opportunity to enjoy the employment security economic security and retirement security they earned through years of hard work and sacrifice
9219534 these members unwavering long term solidarity and support for our bargaining committee has been rewarded
9219535 we believe that ratification of the proposed agreement is a major step toward raising the industry standard in wages benefits and other contractual protections without sacrificing the long term viability of arcelormittal in a competitive market
9219536 id like to thank our local union leadership for their unwavering solidarity
9219537 our support staff and headquarters technicians for their talent and dedication and most of all our members and retirees for their commitment to keeping our proud traditions of union activism and steelmaking alive in their communities for over 100 years
9219538 we know that many of these plants would have been shut down years ago if not for the leadership role these men and women assumed when the time came to restructure and consolidate the steel industry in north america

9219580 in our era of techno savvy megachurches and postmodern emerging churches holiness when it is discussed at all is often associated with moral behavior such as sexual purity financial honesty and commitment to private prayer while weve cast off old legalistic notions of holiness weve merely replaced them with private moralistic notions we act as if holiness were either outdated or something that characterizes only a small if important part of our lives
9219581 to be sure biblical terms translated holy or holiness qadosh hagios carry a strong secondary connotation of moral purity but moral purity is not first and foremost what scripture is talking about instead the most basic meaning of the words is to be set apart or dedicated to god to belong to god i will be your god and you will be my people says yahweh lev 26 12 heb 8 10 thus prior to any consideration of morality biblical holiness describes a unique relationship that god has established and desires with his people this relationship has moral ramifications but it precedes moral behavior before we are ever called to be good we are called to be holy unless we rightly understand and affirm the primacy of this relationship we fall into the inevitable trap of reducing holiness to mere morality

9219690 at the headwaters of the cape fear river basin reidsville is in a unique position to lead the way and be a good watershed steward
9219691 that monday we took him to see the doctor and by wednesday he was in the hospital
9219692 they finally decided zachs body had an allergic reaction to the eosinophilic cells
9219693 they were actually eating away at the cells in his lungs causing small holes in his lungs
9219694 even on the ventilator he was having trouble keeping up his oxygen level
9219695 its nice to have a place to stay close to the hospital but its awful lonely there
9219696 but the support weve received from friends back home and all over has really been overwhelming i cant begin to tell you how much that means
9219697 thats when zach began to show signs of getting better
9219698 for me thats when the power of prayer really became real
9219699 we have some friends there who knew about zach and they told their church family about him
9219700 before we knew it we were getting cards and e mails from people at that church telling us how hard they had been praying for zach
9219701 i know its been hard on randy and dawn zachs parents with zach being so sick and added to that is all the travel theyve had to do and missing so much work
9219702 we just wanted to show them how much we cared and do something to help out with the extra expenses
9219703 theres a real sense of brotherhood among those of us in emergency services
9219704 but its easy to see that zach has stirred the hearts of a lot of people in the community and beyond weve got a lot of new people here tonight that just wanted to come donate to zach and his family
9219705 i just heard about this and decided it was one way i could help out zach
9219706 its great to see all of these people out here for him
9219707 that means the holes in his lungs are healing and that will help him improve quicker
9219708 theyre keeping him under heavy sedation and hes showing small steps of improvement every day
9219709 weve just been overwhelmed by the way people have come together to pray for zach and help us through this
9219710 weve never experienced anything like it before and i dont know if we could have made without all this support
9219711 she said she couldnt stay because it was too emotional for her but she wanted to drop off a donation for the shelter
9219712 were about to move into a new home in about a year and the shelters about to move into a new home so i dont think we will
9219713 many times it depends on the situation when inspectors visit shelters
9219714 right now were trying to put a brand or an image together to make it easier to pitch to business owners
9219715 we asked when was the earliest they expected to start some said 2010 at the earliest but that could change
9219716 the bottom line is if the money is not there we have to scale back somewhere and thats where itll have to be
9219717 though we joke that we need as much as we can possibly get
9219718 well build a shelter with all the features if we can but theyre a secondary concern the building will maximize sustainability and controlling operations cost but it will definitely be built with an eye toward later expansion
9219719 my guess is no it wont but my hope is well find other revenue streams too
9219720 i cant comment on reidsville veterinary but the county has the utmost commitment to using this money wisely
9219721 i think weve made a lot of progress for the last couple of years i am thrilled to be in a party that no longer cedes the faith community to the republican party

9219726 but for the rest of us theres still no change mccain doesnt get it calling this broken economy strong wants to keep spending 10 billion a month in iraq and votes with george bush 90 percent of the time

9219729 i think you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers
9219730 and the statement that joe biden and i put out reflects our sentiments
9219731 shes a washington outsider with a commitment to the conservative principles that will make our nation stronger
9219732 i look forward to campaigning for sen mccain gov palin and republicans all across the country
9219733 that if they are not welcome on the democrats ticket they have a place with republicans
9219734 sen john mccain has made a great pick in gov sarah palin she has demonstrated tremendous leadership as the chief executive of her state
9219735 there are no red states there are no blue states there is only the united states of america
9219736 this is the first time that ive hit the ball solidly for two days in a row in about two months
9219737 im very excited to see what ive got coming on sunday and monday
9219738 it had a tremendous effect thats the reason i feel like my ball striking has been off for a while i havent played in winds where if i just crushed a 3 iron it goes 145 yards i mean i consider myself one of the longer players out here and its embarrassing to hit a 3 wood and not hit it over 200 yards
9219739 i didnt know if we were going to have time to figure it out and luckily we had thursday to figure it out and its been working ever since
9219740 we had a decision to make either lay it up and have about 170 into a tough pin on the left or go for it
9219741 i was actually planning on hitting 3 wood and my caddie eric larson told me to hit 5 wood just to make sure i got over the lip i hit a 5 wood very solid and it almost caught the lip and im glad i didnt hit the 3 wood
9219742 i really cant put it into words i cant explain it
9219743 when i made the walker cup team in 2005 as an amateur i thought that was the greatest thing i could do obviously this is one step ahead of that i know when i lace my shoes up and will be representing the usa im going to be very proud and excited to be on that first tee
9219744 i didnt do that well my first ryder cup and was probably too stupid to figure it out for my second one as well eventually as i get older im figuring out that its a little more important how im playing on friday than how im doing on tuesday and wednesday
9219745 i have town hall meetings all over the country all of the time and i know how people are hurting
9219746 i dont think americans are too concerned that my father in law was able to achieve the great american success story they want to stay in their own homes
9219747 first of all i think a lot of them know i spent 51 2 years in a lot of anxiety and pain
9219748 and i didnt have a kitchen table and i didnt have a chair
9219749 i was just talking to some people in ohio where they continue to lose jobs they continue to lose their homes
9219750 ive got to give them a specific and strong plan of action
9219751 in difficult times weve had a bush administration and voters want change
9219752 ive got to make a convincing case that i represent the right kind of change based on my record and outlining a strong agenda
9219753 sure i do sure i do and its a documented fact that it was the dnc that went after me first and the 527s political groups and the unions
9219754 but the fact is people should have a sense of humor
9219755 let me say sen obama made a choice about iraq and he chose to say the surge wouldnt work he said it would fail he got the nomination in large degree by going to the far left of his party on iraq
9219756 i chose the path which was least popular im not questioning his patriotism im questioning his judgment and i will continue to question his judgment and his qualifications to lead
9219757 what i hear from everybody i know is that i dont talk about it enough
9219758 people keep saying to me talk about it more we need to hear your personal story how you made a choice for your country when you refused to come home early i think that sen obama has a great story to tell and certainly i dont begrudge him telling it
9219759 theyre not going to speak theyre not going to do any politicking or campaigning theyre just part of our family and its appropriate for our family be there
9219760 both of them are on duty so theyll be leaving right after the convention is over back to their duties
9219761 sure im nervous particularly given the fact that sen obama is probably the greatest speaker of our time
9219762 ich bin kein t rkenschreck kein antimuslim guru ich habe an der seite kritischer muslime ein von feigen politikern verdr ngtes problem in den ffentlichen diskurs gebracht wie k nnen zwei h chst unterschiedliche kulturkreise der jud o christliche und der islamische unter wahrung der demokratie miteinander auskommen es ist die nationale schicksalsfrage unseres jahrhunderts die auseinandersetzung um gro moscheen ist nur eines ihrer symptome
9219763 because of the nature of global telecommunications we are playing with a tremendous home field advantage and we need to exploit that edge

9219773 there is no doubt that mccain again is making a strategic choice to appeal to a particular demographic fundamentalist right wing gun owning christians

9219775 what is popularly called transcendentalism among us is idealism idealism as it appears in 1842 as thinkers mankind has ever divided into two sects materialists and idealists the first class founding on experience the second on consciousness the first class beginning to think from the data of the senses the second class perceive that the senses are not final and say the senses give us representation of things but what are the things themselves they cannot tell the materialist insists on facts history on the force of circumstances and the animal wants of man the idealist on the power of thought and of will on inspiration on miracle on individual culture
9219776 his thought that is the universe his experience inclines him to behold the procession of facts you call the world as flowing perpetually outwards from an invisible unsounded centre in himself centre alike of him and of them and necessitating him to regard all things as having a subjective or relative experience relative to that aforesaid unknown centre of him
9219777 you think me the child of my circumstances i make my circumstance
9219778 the transcendentalist adopts the whole connection of spiritual doctrine he believes in miracle in the perpetual openness of the human mind to new influx of light and power he believes in inspiration and in ecstasy
9219779 they are lonely the spirit of their writing and conversation is lonely they repel influences they shun general society they incline to shut themselves in their chamber in the house to live in the country rather than in town and to find their tasks and amusements in solitude
9219780 society to be sure does not like this well it saith whoso goes to walk alone accuses the world world he declareth all to be unfit to be his companions it is very uncivil nay insulting
9219781 their thought and emotion comes in like a flood quite withdraws from them all notice of those carping critics they surrender themselves with glad heart to the heavenly guide and only by implication reject the clamorous nonsense of the hour
9219782 their heart is the ark in which the fire is concealed which shall burn in a broader and universal flame let them obey the genius then most when his impulse is wildest then most when he seems to lead to uninhabitable deserts of thought and life for the path which the hero travels alone is the highest of health and benefit to mankind
9219783 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
9219784 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
9219785 okay so phase 1 cuddle with him as much as possible attach yourself to his side knowing edward hell be too much of a gentleman to push you away thats good because we want him slightly conditioned as time goes on but remember no kissing yet
9219786 the kissing should be saved for phase 2 tempt him with more than just your blood
9219787 and then when he least expects it the scent will mysteriously vanish but hell be exaughsted he wont be able to deny you anything he may bite you before you even finish speaking

9219792 trovo molto grave afferma il deputato arturo iannaccone preannunciando uninterrogazione su mancino al guardasigilli angelino alfano che il vicepresidente del csm venga chiamato in causa costantemente per vicende politiche locali dalle quali considerato il delicatissimo e alto ruolo istituzionale che riveste dovrebbe stare alla larga evidentemente mancino come dichiarato da pi parti continua a fare politica come se fosse un esponente di partito riceve gli amministratori e d indicazioni ai dirigenti del pd irpino
9219793 pare che mancino sia intervenuto direttamente nella gestione delle recenti crisi al comune di avellino e alla provincia come del resto ha dichiarato giuseppe de mita nipote di ciriaco ndr e ci sarebbe estremamente grave credo che sia giunto il momento di sollevare la questione a livello istituzionale

9219799 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
9219800 what if those machines had a small amount of intelligence and they could assemble themselves into various shapes and were capable of movement or locomotion
9219801 if you had enough of them you could create arbitrary shapes and have the assembly of machines that could take on any form and move in arbitrary ways
9219802 my cell phone is too big to fit comfortably in my pocket and too small for my fingers its worse if i try to watch movies or do my e mail but if i had 200 to 300 milliliters of catoms i could have it take on the shape of the device that i need at that moment
9219803 to form its smallest shape or even be a little squishy so i can just drop it in my pocket
9219804 sometime over the next 40 years this will become everyday technology

9219821 one can often be in doubt about the effect of a word or a phrase and one needs rules that one can rely on when instinct fails i think the following rules will cover most cases never use a metaphor simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print never use a long word where a short one will do if it is possible to cut a word out always cut it out never use the passive where you can use the active never use a foreign phrase a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday english equivalent break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous

9219828 the focus of the article is the transition at eastman kodak from film to digital technology that transition is now in full swing but kodak is late getting into the digital game it is ironic that they have only focused the company in this direction
9219829 this is not an uncommon story in our world of discontinuous change past success has a downside

9219837 when our savior spake of his making men free the jews were offended it hurt their pride to be represented as slaves yet slaves they were and such is every sinner however insensible of it till christ has made him free and the longer he continues in this state the more he is entangled and the greater is the difficulty of making his escape

9219845 the improvement comes from a completely different attitude we showed that against twente and did it again tonight the fulham match had come at the start of the season after difficult games including one away in the champions league and maybe we were not ready mentally

9219859 ich bin sehr zufrieden wir haben eine intensive zeit hinter uns gebracht es sind jetzt sieben punkte und es ist das erste mal dass es sich wie ein sieg anf hlt denn beim sieg in leverkusen haben wir dede verloren das hat den ganzen tag berschattet gegen bayern hat sich zwar niemand verletzt trotzdem waren wir nicht ganz gl cklich gegen cottbus sah es insgesamt sehr gut aus wir waren auf den gegner vorbereitet der ein sehr leidenschaftliches spiel gemacht hat aber meine mannschaft hat dieser leidenschaft einiges entgegengesetzt wir sind mit einer sehr guten einstellung zu werke gegangen und haben verdient gewonnen auch wenn wir am ende ein wenig gl ck gebraucht haben
9219860 das ist zu diesem zeitpunkt gar kein problem weil es keinen menschen interessiert in dortmund denn es geht allen darum dass wir jetzt gegen schalke gewinnen dementsprechend wird niemand euphorisch werden eher der glauben ist gr er geworden dass wir die aufgabe gegen schalke bew ltigen k nnen gegen cottbus habe ich eine entwicklung gesehen und das ist eine sch ne erkenntnis
9219861 wir nehmen es wie es kommt am freitag haben wir erfahren gegen wen wir im uefa cup spielen udinese ist eine sensationelle reizvolle aufgabe aber dass man von vorneherein sagen kann dass man weiterkommt w re schon sehr optimistisch dann haben wir im dfb pokal das spiel zu hause gegen hertha bsc und ein weiteres schweres programm in der liga zum gl ck kommen jetzt nach und nach verletzte spieler zur ck alex frei hat heute f r die amateure gespielt und zwei tore geschossen tinga kommt zur ck patrick owomoyela wird immer st rker auch die verpflichtung von lee wird uns helfen wir brauchen die jungs weil wir so viele spiele haben wir hoffen dass das programm noch lange so anstrengend bleibt
9219862 die jungs sind einfach sehr lernwillig und zum gl ck auch ausgesprochen talentiert es ist ja nicht so dass wir ihnen das fu ballspielen beigebracht h tten an der art und weise wie sie zusammen verteidigen arbeiten wir nat rlich dass sie so zusammenpassen war einfach eine f gung wir sind alle froh und wollen gar nicht so viel dar ber reden dass das so gut funktioniert dass wir es den jungs zutrauen ist keine frage fehler machen sowieso alle innenverteidiger egal ob sie 19 sind oder 30
