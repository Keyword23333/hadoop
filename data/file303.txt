3030047 the question then is should the fate of the archaeological record and of antiquities alienated from their archaeological context remain under the jurisdiction of national governments is there an alternative yes and it was once in place and encouraged the scientific excavation of the archaeological record and the preservation and sharing of ancient artifacts between local governments and international museums it is called partage under that policy foreign led excavation teams provided the expertise and material means to lead excavations and in return were allowed to share the finds with the local governments archaeological museum s that is how the collections of archaeological museums at the university of chicago the university of pennsylvania and harvard and yale universities were built as well as important parts of the collections of the british museum and the metropolitan museum of art it was also how the collections in archaeological museums in egypt iraq afghanistan and turkey were built foreign museums underwrote and led scientific excavations from which both the international archaeological and local political communities benefited while local tensions increased over time as nationalist aspirations took hold partage served both communities well it was only with the flood of nationalist retentionist cultural property laws in the second half of the twentieth century that partage all but disappeared the collections of the university museums mentioned above now could not be built and the directors and faculty curators of those museums many of whom are the loudest proponents of national retentionist patrimony cultural property laws could not teach and research as they do now much of their work is dependent on a policy no longer legal in the countries with jurisdiction over the archaeological materials they study
3030048 for many decades in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries archaeological finds were shared between the excavating party and the local host country through partage this is how the great ghandaran collection got to the mus e guimet in paris shared with afghanistan the assyrian collection got to the british museum in london shared with iraq before the formation of the modern independent government of iraq the lydian materials from sardis got to the metropolitan museum of art in new york shared with the ottoman empire now turkey the egyptian collection got to the museum of fine arts in boston a number of collections got to the state hermitage museum in st petersburg and of course how the great collections were formed at the university archaeological museums like the peabody museums at harvard and yale the oriental institute at the university of chicago and the university museum at the university of pennsylvania

3030113 does george know how to access alternate universes by using a carpet steamer to create a
3030114 of course he does he does it all the time

3030129 although these findings seem surprising at first they hint at fears parents have about video games
3030130 to some parents video games are full of unknowable dangers while researching for grand theft childhood parents we spoke with in focus groups often bemoaned the fact that they didnt know how to use game controls and felt unequipped to supervise or limit video game play of course parents dont want their children drinking alcohol but thats a more familiar risk
3030131 study parents more worried about video games over alcohol porn
3030132 im not surprised the offense looked this sharp we have a veteran team its easy to see that we have some explosive players out there obviously this will get a little tougher when we start putting in more of the offense overall it was a very good night i thought played very very well
3030133 we didnt make too many mistakes on offense but i will look at the film and i am sure there are ways for us to improve the other guys made me look good
3030134 thats easy to see but he has a long way to go to be ready for a game of division i football i never want to throw too much on a quarterback he can do some amazing things and is going to be a great player at fresno state before his career is over
3030135 ive never had that many passes thrown my way in a scrimmage i just want to stay focused on playing assignment perfect and contributing what i can on special teams and offense
3030136 there were some really good things out there on the field tonight
3030137 we will take a good look at the film and make some adjustments and shore up some things but i think we are in a good place to start building to our team and adding things to the playbook when you have a mature and veteran team like ours thats a huge help
3030138 you couldnt find anyone more excited for the season than me
3030139 i start teaching next week so i am very excited to see the team and have some fun im hoping they can get to a bcs bowl but they have to take it one game at a time
3030140 i like having the big ten come into bulldog stadium
3030141 each season is like a flower because hopes are higher every year
3030142 i look for this team to continue how they ended last year
3030143 we have a great offense and had a great recruiting class coach hill has a good program with good kids they are playing to win and im excited to see how this season plays out
3030144 all were asking for is an opportunity to have a debate and a vote on our plan
3030145 we highly value our relationship with ms knowles it is categorically untrue that loreal paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for feria hair color
3030146 now is the time to join together through constant cooperation strong institutions shared sacrifice and a global commitment to progress to meet the challenges of the 21st century
3030147 it is not who i am underneath but what i do that defines me
3030148 my own feeling is that if we get to a 4 degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase

3030165 there is such excitement in the open floor plan not to mention the beautiful japanese garden that wraps around the place
3030166 while the japanese garden was a great plus it was the interior that captured our imagination
3030167 it was easy for me to visualize creating a dream home and since we were relatively newlyweds living in an unimaginative condo off metairie road i thought it would be a unique hideaway for both of us
3030168 it is so peaceful and quiet with wooden paths leading to all kinds of exciting corners and separate seemingly secret gardens
3030169 i grew up in northeastern mississippi near a creek and learned a love of the outdoors from my mother
3030170 i love tending the garden just like she did here we have the perfect oasis
3030171 its one of my favorite spots to relax and watch television

3030173 the creoles have always been famous for the excellent salads which grace their tables

3030180 i was blinded by the splinters of glass for about five seconds they were in both eyes and cuts all over my forehead and cheeks and my neck
3030181 they paramedics bathed my eyes right away on the hard shoulder in the ambulance but they felt that i needed to go away to stirling royal to get x rayed and cleaned our properly
3030182 ive never experienced anything like it in 27 years of driving lgvs
3030183 i was a wee bit shocked all weekend but i went out and had a few bottles of budweiser and that sorted me out sorted the nerves out
3030184 the lorrys getting the new windscreen fitted this afternoon they his employers were wanting me to take a wee couple of days off and just relax for a wee while and get it out my system
3030185 but i decided theres no point in lying down to it just take the bull by the horns and back to my work as soon as i felt able to go back
3030186 if an object goes through the windscreen of a vehicle travelling at 70mph it can carry the same force as a bullet the consequences could be fatal
3030187 if the driver tries to take evasive action there is likely to be an accident at that kind of speed

3030193 ive been on pain killers for the last six days i took four this morning
3030194 its unfortunate timing its very bad but theres nothing i can do
3030195 we are going according to plan with the upstream andtransport but upgrading which had been planned for 2014 isbeing postponed to 2016
3030196 that means that we will notmake a final decision before the end of 2009
3030197 if we face an uncertain regulatory framework and anoverheated market next year in alberta no one can force us tomake an investment decision
3030198 this attack which once again shows the ugly face of terrorism demonstrates plainly how far the terrorists are from human values

3030212 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3030213 they must not know bout me they must not know bout me

3030225 for now the europeans should stick to their role as mediator
3030226 they have already stated that their relations with russia could be affected by the conflict in georgia the eu cannot go further at the moment because it is too early to say that its mediation has failed and that alternative options must be reviewed they must still go to moscow and try to convince the russians
3030227 the emergency meeting of the eu foreign ministers on wednesday will be another chance for the europeans to show their unity
3030228 if the eu presents a united front it could be an asset in dealing with russia
3030229 it would be good to have a unified eu position on mediation
3030230 for the moment this seems to be the case the european countries share the priorities recognition of georgias territorial integrity an immediate ceasefire the withdrawal of troops and a return to the status quo
3030231 what we saw recently with the germans proposed peace deal for abkhazia was that the german mediation was accepted by all the parties and that the russians did not brush aside the draft text
3030232 although this proposal did not answer all their requirements it could at least be discussed that is a positive precedent for germany
3030233 the stabilization force is in principle a viable option in the medium term and one which is being discussed at eu level at the moment
3030234 it would however require an internationalization of the situation with member states having to agree to the use of troops as a buffer in the region this is very difficult to conceive as many states have differing relations with russia and also security within the eu is still a much debated issue
3030235 the eu could threaten to pull out of the negotiations with russia over the new partnership cooperation agreement while georgia could be threatened with a rejection of its proposed nato membership
3030236 both are of course very problematic and difficult as the eu actually wants a new partnership with russia and the rejection of the nato membership is what russia has been pushing for
3030237 this might initiate other actions in neighboring countries so we can continue doing this in a coordinated fashion throughout the european union
3030238 that would be a good way to fight these crimes
3030239 once youre in there are frequent reinvestigations but its just part of process here
3030240 its interesting theres so much scrutiny that a normal person might not want to put up with that but its part of the mission
3030241 we have a counterintelligence center that helps us with that
3030242 they are very concerned about foreign intelligence services that are interested in penetrating the cia because of that we pay particular attention to the kinds of things we put on our network

3030247 the whole team played well but they list concentration at a point and vanzekin has to be a bit careful he should not be in a too much of a hurry that is what caused the goal for japan
3030248 there are areas where they should play one touch and other areas where they should carry the ball and they have to know the right time to do this
3030249 i dont know why siasia replaced osaze he was doing well and with his experience he should be the pivot of the team and do more of the job in the midfield
3030250 ekpo used to play for me here at akwa united and i know what his ability siasia should bring him on early enough he is skillful strong and a good passer of the ball
3030251 the new stadium is wonderful its top class i wish i had played in such a stadium during my heyday
3030252 on 3 may 2006 a day after orlando stadium celebrated its 47th anniversary we stood at almost this exact spot when we handed her the old lady to the contractors
3030253 on that day we marked the city of johannesburgs ground breaking movement towards the first 2010 project to be initiated by the city
3030254 when we announced that orlando stadium would be demolished and reconstructed we had a vision of what the new stadium would look like and what it would mean to the community of greater orlando
3030255 the community at large has benefited from this development through the jobs that have been created
3030256 to date 2 205 jobs have been created and training is being provided in the fields of carpentry bricklaying plastering and painting
3030257 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

3030265 such a state of peace is the object of divine promise and is brought about by gods mercy granting deliverance and freedom from all the distresses that are experienced as a result of sin hence the message of salvation is called the gospel of peace for this peace can only be the result of reconciliation with god referring to the new relationship between man and god brought about by the atonement
3030266 daughter your faith has healed you go in peace and be freed from your suffering
3030267 as god he had all the rights of deity and yet during his incarnate state he surrendered his right to manifest himself visibly as the god of all splendor and glory
3030268 is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
3030269 you have helped build this movement from the bottom up and barack wants you to be the first to know his choice
3030270 once youve signed up please forward this e mail to your friends family and co workers to let them know about this special opportunity no other campaign has done this before you can be part of this important moment
3030271 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
3030272 obama started negative campaigning on john mccain long before we started punching back and i think a lot of our effort is really to get back into this game try and galvanize some of the public attention back onto this race make sure everybody understands theres two people in this race not just one and i think weve been successful in doing that
3030273 the lobbyists running his low road campaign the money billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies but almost nothing for families like yours lurching to the right then the left the old washington dance whatever it takes john mccain a washington celebrity playing the same old washington games
3030274 whatever it was that sparked the emergence of human behaviour 30 000 40 000 years ago im convinced it was not genetic
3030275 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
3030276 the motive is to develop the country we work and work in cooperation with the people and government the ultimate is to help people know what they are doing what we do is to teach communities how to grow cassava rice or and other crops in collaboration with our vietnamese partners
3030277 we are bringing mechanisation to work efficiently to employ every member of the community that will be trained by 1 000 vietnamese farmers in every 10 000 hectares of land
3030278 after the war vietnam became the poorest nation on earth now 32 years after it has grown to become the second largest producers of rice in the world after china and by so has increased their social life
3030279 for a developing country like nigeria it must be appreciated that government initiates and leads in almost every aspect of our development efforts since independence agricultural development in nigerian in particular has been government driven
3030280 the private sector will need to do more in this area government establishes demonstration farms and in some cases agricultural and food industries for its people sadly however these projects are hardly sustainable today there are many moribund agricultural projects scattered all over benue state and indeed the entire country
3030281 it is palpable fact that economic emancipation opportunities abound in water and fisheries resources development in benue state there are potentials for investment in fish production processing and marketing sport or recreation fishing and tourism the fisheries sub sector can also create and provide job opportunities in the rural areas
3030282 there is therefore the need for concerted efforts to develop this sub sector to promote rural economy
3030283 and then well constructed and beautified huts will be provided around as cool joints where pepper soup made from the very fish will be sold this will attract more than enough patronage from the general public before you know it the lakes will no longer be an attraction of people only during the annual festival
3030284 the akata lake development project which was conceived since the creation of benue state in 1976 now needs to be revisited in the wake of modern tourist trend
3030285 it is pertinent for the state government to establish a viable state of the art integrated farm as a technology development centre to enhance skills acquisition and promotion of rural economy
3030286 the experience of singhai integrated farm centre in benin republic which has been replicated at sapele by delta state government
3030287 government intends to commission a consultant who would submit a comprehensive feasibility study on the project which must cover all foreseeable challenges and problems militating against the sub sector
3030288 the winners will go home with handsome prizes cars motorcycles and other attractive prizes
3030289 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

3030293 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3030294 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3030295 his campaign is run by lobbyists that represent georgia and other countries
3030296 an example of senator mccains push to spread democracy in that part of the world as a very important advance of americas interest
3030297 i wish senator obama had actually confronted the issue not trying to detract our attention by focusing on a mccain adviser
3030298 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3030299 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3030300 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3030301 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3030302 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3030303 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3030304 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3030305 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3030306 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3030307 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3030308 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3030309 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3030310 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3030311 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3030312 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3030313 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3030314 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3030315 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3030316 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3030317 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3030318 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3030319 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3030320 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3030321 the deal gives us access to some of the best minds in the world in the commodities sector
3030322 todays announcement is a testament to our success to date and offers huge promise for the future
3030323 for now its being used for the physical delivery but its failing to attract the liquidity from speculators
3030324 not only offers strong potential from an investment perspective but also constitutes a strategic partnership that will develop our footprint in the middle east

3030327 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3030328 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3030329 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3030330 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3030331 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3030332 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3030333 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3030334 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3030335 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3030336 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3030337 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3030338 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3030339 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

3030341 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3030342 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3030343 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3030344 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3030345 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3030346 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3030347 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3030348 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3030349 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3030350 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3030351 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3030352 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3030353 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3030354 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3030355 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3030356 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3030357 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3030358 can help restore the integrity and preserve the financial viability of a corporation that had descended into corruption and criminal conduct
3030359 this isnt just a career for me its my passion

3030377 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3030378 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3030379 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3030380 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3030381 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3030400 for the last twelve hours inhuman and indiscriminate aerial bombardments of the georgian territory continued the scale of devastating destruction and loss of innocent lives has yet to be assessed russian ground troops armed invasion transformed already in a full scale occupation of parts of georgian territory the process of extermination of georgian population
3030401 what is taking place now is not unexpected the russian federation as you recall on many occasions drew attention to the dangerous situation which was evolving around south ossetia the russian federation on many occasions drew attention to the fact that georgia was increasing at an increasing rate its offensive weapons georgia is the world record holder in the increase of its military budget which over recent years has grown by thirty times and now we understand what the purpose of all this was

3030427 i truly feel that he is extremely repentant of his sins what he did
3030428 it saddens me that we can all preach forgiveness yet we cant forgive
3030429 these days one often hears that it is the christians duty to forgive just as jesus forgave those who crucified him
3030430 you and i have no right religiously or morally to forgive timothy mcveigh or michael carneal only those they sinned against have that right if we are automatically forgiven no matter what we do why repent in fact if we forgive everybody for all the evil they do god and his forgiveness are unnecessary we have substituted ourselves for god

3030470 what is strange and disconcerting is that she would leave them for days and then come back but not do anything about it this was a serious and sustained period of starvation for these animals
3030471 it is obviously a very serious case and she has accepted that since i spoke to her she is a woman of previous good character with no convictions at all the trouble started when her sister died unexpectedly and she has not coped as well as she would have liked too

3030473 americans wishing to spend august vacationing with their families or watching the olympics may wonder why their newspapers and television screens are filled with images of war in the small country of georgia
3030474 concerns about what occurs there might seem distant and unrelated to the many other interests america has around the world and yet russian aggression against georgia is both a matter of urgent moral and strategic importance to the united states of america
3030475 the very existence of independent georgia and the survival of its democratically elected government are at stake
3030476 the implications of russian actions go beyond their threat to the territorial integrity and independence of a democratic georgia russia is using violence against georgia in part to intimidate other neighbors such as ukraine for choosing to associate with the west and adhering to western political and economic values as such the fate of georgia should be of grave concern to americans and all people who welcomed the end of a divided of europe and the independence of former soviet republics the international response to this crisis will determine how russia manages its relationships with other neighbors
3030477 our united purpose should be to persuade the russian government to cease its attacks withdraw its troops and enter into negotiations with georgia we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world world history is often made in remote obscure countries it is being made in georgia today it is the responsibility of the leading nations of the world to ensure that history continues to be a record of humanitys progress toward respecting the values and security of free people
3030478 i just started punching in random three digit combinations i think it was 321
3030479 i regret that some of our partners are not helping us but in fact are trying to impede us i am referring to the us transfer aboard its military transport planes and directly into the conflict zone of the georgian military contingent from iraq
3030480 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3030481 i was very firm with vladimir putin just like i was firm with the russian president dmitry medvedev
3030482 we have an excellent product and sunkist has an excellent marketing network and a brand name that is known around the world sunkist has been streamlining operations reducing costs and greatly expanding the opportunities it offers to growers and shippers weve watched the changes and seen the results and were excited about joining sunkist and enjoying the benefits of membership
3030483 they are a very experienced and respected grower and packer known for their customer service the affiliation brings to our system a large supply quality citrus and a philosophy of excellence that matches our own

3030487 our partnership with asus global institute of sustainability is providing a forum to drive home the challenge and necessity of finding balanced solutions for the earths present and future water needs
3030488 water is the resource that most affects human life and keeping the planets water resources viable into the foreseeable future requires advanced water conservation and better water efficiency through education and innovation
3030489 the schools location in the heart of the sonoran desert gives us a first hand perspective on water management issues and solutions as rapid urbanization pushes the regions water resources to the limit
3030490 balancing limited usable fresh water supplies with population growth and sustainability is a global challenge and it is forums such as these that help stimulate dialogue innovation and better stewardship
3030491 when all of the judicial and appeals processes have exhausted themselves and when any of the three are subject to the death penalty australia will make a plea for clemency on their behalf at that time
3030492 when it comes to non australian citizens we make a judgement on a case by case basis
3030493 when it comes to terrorists who have been convicted and are subject to the death penalty australia does not as a matter of policy make representations on their behalf
3030494 almost seems genuine its almost like we didnt have much the last two years but the core is good here and we can get it done thats a little surprising
3030495 the defense is going to be improved if im getting the right vibes chris perry is an excellent receiver out of the backfield and a powerful runner if he can stay healthy and ben utecht gives them a dimension theyve never had with the receiving tight end and that will complement the receivers you put t j houshmandzadeh and chad on the outside and if you keep those linebackers on the inside theyll get some big windows to throw into
3030496 gap discipline footwork no free releases for the receivers breakdown timing you get a feeling the defense is going to be better
3030497 if we had a strengthening of the dollar that would help
3030498 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3030499 i mean the transfer by the united states of a georgian contingent in iraq with military transport planes practically to the conflict zone

3030506 viewers then also had to work out the total of the numbers for the different coloured kites then every number from each of the kites need to be added or deducted from the other respective kite the final answer was the result of all these sums plus the original numbers that could be made from each of the numbers on the kites

3030519 i think the fencing outfit is clearly a very hot outfit
3030520 im surprised theres not a sports illustrated fencing edition where they put celebrities in fencing outfits
3030521 i think id be all right but hopefully that will not come to fruition
3030522 i feel like part of my job is to be an educator in the sport
3030523 and to get people involved in it so im more than willing to answer any questions people may have
3030524 thats when i started to think that maybe i can make an olympic team
3030525 i think fencing has had a huge impact on my life in every aspect
3030526 i think the biggest application is just finding a model for what its like to be successful and i think ive really started to find that
3030527 theres lots of things that go into it how to set goals how to develop plans that work how to deal with the challenges of trying to reach that goal and then as you start to get stronger how to allow yourself mentally to break through
3030528 but i was like its olympic qualifying so im definitely getting on this plane
3030529 the teachers ive worked with in training theyre absolutely the heroes to me
3030530 with sports and with the olympics you get so much credit and you know its very public and you get to feel really proud about what you do but we have a lot of teachers doing amazing things and its not like theyre doing it because theyre getting public acknowledgement theyre just doing it because theyre passionate about education
3030531 i have my sport and education is another really huge passion for me i feel really lucky in that regard
3030532 i knew being a rookie and the youngest on the team i wasnt going to come in and throw a lot i knew i had to be ready for the japan game in 04 and thats what i prepared all summer for
3030533 i spent a lot of the games in the bullpen and thats all right i was ready to go if they needed me but they didnt need me the way we score runs
3030534 i was under loris wings from day one not only because she was a lefty but also because we were the two pitchers who didnt hit
3030535 she did a good job of letting me grow up on my own she pushed me enough but she didnt push me too hard
3030536 i was raw and hadnt done any kind of international competition and lori tried to keep me calm mentally and told me what to expect once we got to the olympic games
3030537 we need all three of them but we need her osterman to really be on top of her game for us to have the opportunity at a gold medal
3030538 cat is cat she spins the ball better than anyone in the world she is a kid who is not going to be the hardest thrower but she has more movement than anyone she has matured a lot in the mental part of the game we had her last time as a girl out of college now shes a woman she has been in the tough games and is very seasoned
3030539 i dont think this is a game where you have to have complete games out of everyone i could see using two pitchers and possibly three in a game
3030540 i have seen improvement in hitters making adjustments quicker so its kind of nice if you can give them a different look after they have been through the lineup i am going to have a pretty quick hook because we have the talent to give them a different look
3030541 his last 50 were absolutely incredible he had a perfect finish
3030542 theres never been a split like this in my memory not running down somebody who holds the world record whos on their game that was incredible
3030543 the 400 free relay has been spanked around the last two olympics
3030544 this was the toughest one to win those are always the best ones to win
3030545 when i flipped at the 50 and saw how far ahead he was the thought crossed my mind for a split second theres no way then it flipped no im here representing the my country
3030546 i got a supercharge and took it from there it was unreal
3030547 that split it had to be the best ever thats the kind of anchor you dream of it shows what you can do when you dont think about it you just go
3030548 in cases where there is a long history of resistance this is an indicator of death so it is important to try all the possibilities
3030549 probably the largest database of its kind in the world
3030550 after i got cut from the last olympics i didnt know if i was ever going to be an olympian things changed and i came back and im very excited about it
3030551 i called merrill and said look im going to be coaching through beijing
3030552 i want you to think about joining the team and being part of this
3030553 you just want it that much more i was a lot younger and when i came back i was a lot more focused a lot more motivated to make sure that this dream happened
3030554 ive always worked hard but now you just go the extra mile
3030555 it took about six months to get back in the groove of things
3030556 you lose your speed you lose your legs its amazing
3030557 compared to how he is now you would consider him really out of shape he slowly got back into it now hes very competitive every day really intense really focused
3030558 when we get games going he has a fire inside of him he very much wears his emotions on his shoulders it could be a good thing it could be a bad thing as long as he focuses it in the right direction its a good thing a positive thing
3030559 goalies need to give direction the balls over here the balls over there you need to help somewhat on offense with the shot clock and where the ball is and stuff like that
3030560 people have told me im probably one of the most vocal goalkeepers out there
3030561 im very loud out there it kind of pumps me up but i like to let my players know whats going on too
3030562 ive had coaches sometimes say tone it down a little bit
3030563 sometimes you get so caught up in talking that you can miss the ball
3030564 you start doing all this talking and start doing too much you lose focus on what youre supposed to be doing it happens to him sometimes it happens to everybody sometimes
3030565 he basically came in on his recruiting trip and told the starting goalie he was going to take his job and he did
3030566 in college especially when youre a freshman its like baby steps at this level theres no baby steps
3030567 i think he has really had to grow up both as a player and a person and get to a position where he can get that same level of confidence back as an international player
3030568 you need to be confident you need to see the ball well you need to believe in yourself and your defense in front of you and that all takes time to get to at this level but i can see merrill getting a lot closer to where he needs to be with that for sure
3030569 weve been encouraging black men to get screened at age 40 or 45 for more than a decade yet only one third of these high risk men reported being tested
3030570 our findings provide an important baseline assessment of psa test use among young men as physicians debate whether to expand use of the psa test in young men with risk stratification strategies
3030571 the study shows how dopamine shapes the two main circuits of the brain that control how we choose to act and what happens in these disease states
3030572 dopamine released by drugs leads to abnormal strengthening of the cortical synapses driving the striatal go circuits while weakening synapses at opposing stop circuits as a result when events associated with drug taking where you took the drug what you were feeling occur there is an uncontrollable drive to go and seek drugs
3030573 all of our actions in a healthy brain are balanced by the urge to do something and the urge to stop
3030574 our work suggests that it is not just the strengthening of the brain circuits helping select actions that is critical to dopamines effects it is the weakening of the connections that enable us to stop as well
3030575 the study illuminates why parkinsons patients have trouble performing everyday tasks like reaching across a table to pick up a glass of water when they are thirsty
3030576 our study suggests that the inability to move in parkinsons disease is not a passive process like a car running out of gas
3030577 rather the car doesnt move because your foot is jammed down on the brake dopamine normally helps you adjust the pressure on the brake and gas pedals it helps you learn that when you see a red light at an intersection you brake and when the green light comes on you take your foot off the brake and depress the gas pedal to go parkinsons disease patients who have lost the neurons that release dopamine have their foot perpetually stuck on the brake

3030581 our farm service agency has already started making loans with todays costs of running a farm our top consideration
3030582 we are proud to help the hard working americans who were struggling with the high costs of running a family farm especially beginning and socially disadvantaged producers usda is working together with farmers at the local level to make this happen
3030583 if a person downstream or someone who believes they are being negatively affected by the use of water from aquifers complains the farmer can be denied legal access to water this lack of legal standards in most southeastern states adds to the risk farmers face in growing a crop rodekohr says
3030584 each american uses about 150 gallons of water per day but most of that goes back into the water supply a city like atlanta uses huge amounts of water but only a fraction of what native vegetation uses and we dont get that water back
3030585 currently the water passes through these states and is never used if we capture it and use it some percentage of this water goes back into the system and actually increases the total availability during the dry periods of the year
3030586 we saw him leave but in the olympics it could be anything it could be to talk to reporters it could be a problem with tickets and logistics of practices we didnt know
3030587 so it wasnt until after we got our therapy when we had our meetings and we saw a lot of people show up that we knew something was wrong we havent seen him since he left the room
3030588 hes the guy whos been steering leading our squad through these last four years
3030589 i know the guys it meant an awful lot to us when we heard from him he talked about trying to move on each of us has to try to move on in our own way
3030590 our knee jerk reactions were like any other human beings we were angry we were upset
3030591 we wanted to talk to our friends and family who are here and back home we met as a team as a male sport we tend to hide our feelings a lot but there was definitely a moment where guys let off how they felt about the situation how they felt about hugh not being on the bench
3030592 as soon as the rubber meets the road he has to make a decision
3030593 id much rather be sitting on the bench telling him what i think he should be doing and having him saying i dont think so rather than where i am right now
3030594 we wanted to do something with our jerseys but we didnt have time so we put wizs moms initials and dads initials on the back of our shoes and just talked about huddling up together taking a couple of moments to let him know that were thinking about him
3030595 its been very emotional for us the last 24 hours obviously
3030596 were playing a volleyball game out there nothing in comparison to the loss that happened to our team usa volleyball our whole delegation obviously we all came here to do this and its very hard to continue on
3030597 to feel that feeling of helplessness we just kind of talked and thought the best thing we can do is go out and play volleyball
3030598 china is a sleeping giant but when she awakes the world will tremble
3030599 do you think that the us was showing off too much
3030600 were they showing numbers of circus just to impress the crowds
3030601 going to the ready room i started getting like kind of like chills up my body right then and there i knew i was starting to get more excited
3030602 i wasnt comfortable after the first 200 and seeing everyone so close together
3030603 that usually is not how it is after the first 200 usually thats the 300 mark after the breaststroke
3030604 i think it made my breaststroke a lot stronger at that point coming home on freestyle is all adrenaline
3030605 i looked up and saw him after the race and he nodded and waved the american flag
3030606 thats a pretty special feeling i waved and nodded my head back thats definitely pretty neat having the president here tonight and having him cheer us all on
3030607 weve talked all along about building on small successes one after the other
3030608 and this is a small success now they build on it
3030609 we knew the game was going to be called tightly
3030610 and i knew if i did my job wed win and i just blocked the things i needed to block and our team played great team defense
3030611 im going to be honest be prepared for him to score a lot of goals against every time we dont only have tony we have a lot of firepower a lot of people that can shoot tony just stepped up today hes a great captain and thats his job
3030612 and it really helps we have ryan bailey in the two meter position everyone comes back to him they leave me and i just put the ball away
3030613 because the u s team is comparatively stronger the score was pretty good for us because in the past when we have competed against them we did significantly worse
3030614 theyve worked hard and from where we saw them a couple years ago theyve improved dramatically theyve put a lot into it over this last two year period and theyve definitely gotten better and better
3030615 i think everyone looks at china definitely as a team that can beat you if you dont play your a game
3030616 we have some rest tomorrow but well be practicing twice and going through italy and ill definitely be looking at a lot of tape
3030617 yes wholesale gasoline diesel coal ah not simply natural gas but gas diesel coal propane all of those things will be
3030618 but it is not taxing you when you go to fill up your tank as well it is not taxing the farmer when he goes to get diesel for his tractor it is not doing that
3030619 what he is trying to say is that it is not going to be passed on to the person who is buying gas at the retail level and but we do know that it will in fact increase costs
3030620 you are admitting though that a wholesale level increase will translate into retail prices that are higher for food for power for fuel for everything right
3030621 s o that is going to again help them because the cost of food is going up because of fuel costs
3030622 when you truck stuff from a to b people pay for it at the supermarket level
3030623 wait a second you are going to give canadians cheques
3030624 look let me tell you i mean 25 uh 200 dollar a barrel of oil

3030627 all families meaning with children who actually it doesnt matter what your tax rate is will be for instance getting a boost of about 250 dollars a year on top of the child benefits that are already there for them

3030636 i was putting the bins out when i saw a flash of yellow which turned out to be a kiddies bucket full of crabs all climbing on top of each other
3030637 we rescue thousands of animals every year but you dont expect to be rescuing crabs in the midlands about as far from the coast as its possible to get in the uk
3030638 the first involved a large shore crab found walking down the middle of the road in winson green in birmingham but sadly he didnt survive
3030639 were hoping that this isnt the start of a worrying new craze for bringing crabs back from holiday especially with our seaside resorts reporting a bit of a resurgence this year
3030640 oh pena altar de nuvens sobre a serra pa o de sombras reaes feito em granito e seculos de azul olhando a terra das janelas que ogivam o infinito
3030641 please dont interrupt while i am speaking as we are from this point onward peers in the family of nations i hope you have reviewed the diplomatic instruments we sent by courier last night to department of state which delineates the terms of our divorce
3030642 i did receive those and you have no earthly idea the can of whoop
3030643 please sir maintain the decorum of these proceedings so we can move forward to an amicable separation i give you my personal assurance on the safety and well being of all federal personnel we have detained for immediate repatriation to the remainder of these united states any non law enforcement federal personnel who wish to remain behind will be permitted to do so
3030644 i hope you have thought through the consequences of what you are embarking on
3030645 mr president we have had over two hundred years to give the rulers on the potomac a chance but that time has expired effective immediately all so called federal lands now belong to the nation of idaho and we will dispose of these lands at our leisure in the interest of burying the hatchet we will not seek compensation for the seizure abuse and tenure of federal practices on the aforementioned land and call the balance even
3030646 in actuality they belong to neither of us sir on to other business i have alerted my national guard forces to establish checkpoints at all the main arterials in and out of idaho all national guard forces deployed overseas will return home in the next 48 hours i would also caution you on the use of military force to convince idaho and its citizens to forcibly return to the yoke of the union idaho has a well deserved reputation as a rather well equipped state in firearms possession and use as yamamoto said you may find a rifle behind every blade of grass
3030647 no sir i am simply making an observation about the hazards of one country invading another
3030648 you are land locked governor and wholly dependent on federal subsidy for a great deal of employment and infrastructure in idaho
3030649 no longer the tremendous tax burden across the spectrum formally imposed in our nation as a subject state in your country is now effectively terminated and we are going to unleash the free market to address all of our former shortcomings as a result of the overarching government supremacism practiced here before in telephone conversations with my neighboring governors we are on the verge of confederation negotiations that will pave the way for idaho embassies in british columbia montana utah and wyoming we do intend on opening a consular office in dc as soon as we can ensure the diplomatic baggage containing sufficient weapons assures our safety in the greater dc metropolitan area for our diplomatic personnel
3030650 governor what constitutional right do you have to secede from the us
3030651 mr president the behavior you have exhibited toward the constitution has been at best characterized by active neglect and abhorrence for the restraint on governance in the bill of rights i am rather surprised you would resort to assuming the document in any way has weight in washington dc i would suggest my rights extend as far as our ability to throw off what has become a government of occupation instead of cooperation we resign sir and wish to go in peace
3030652 i will use every measure in my arsenal to force you back into the fold
3030653 mr president thank you for the heads up but we have taken certain precautions to ensure that any rash measures on your part have a disproportionate impact in the dc virginia corridor please dont press us on the issue i would like to offer one more rather moderate important proposal to our future business these united states as administered by dc are now essentially bankrupt war on the world out of control spending and borrowing debt and deficit non funded future liabilities in the tens of trillions and a banking infrastructure rotten at every level has pushed the us to an economic abyss from which it cannot shrink we will provide you a demonstration project of tiny government free banking and a formerly enslaved citizenry unleashed to realize their potential with no government interference we simply wish to go our own way untethered from the remora nation dc came to symbolize

3030661 it just shows the tragic level of authoritarianism when the police are cracking down on a group of people who simply want to get together to discuss the most important issue facing the world
3030662 in fact i think they are just trying to repackage what weve already introduced years ago
3030663 its almost laughable to see how many of our policies they have taken and called their own

3030832 nuestros resultados muestran que al menos para las infecciones del tracto urinario el jugo de ar ndanos se dirige a la bacteria correcta las que causan enfermedades pero no tiene ning n efecto sobre organismos no patog nicos lo que sugiere que el jugo de ar ndanos no desestabiliza a las bacterias que forman parte de la flora normal del intestino
3030833 tambi n hemos mostrado que este efecto ocurre en concentraciones de jugo de ar ndanos que son comparables a niveles que esperamos encontrar en el tracto urinario
3030834 esto sugiere que para obtener los beneficios antibacterianos del ar ndano hay que beber jugo de ar ndano de manera regular quiz s todos los d as

3030847 este paro es una fuerte exhortaci n al gobierno para que el transcurso de esta semana nos convoque con una propuesta concreta

3030858 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt message between now amp the conv tell everyone to text vp to 62262 to be the first to know please forward
3030859 the number of offices that obama will be able to open in states where we essentially withdrew from the battlefields in previous campaigns is stunning
3030860 we are going door to door neighbor to neighbor to ensure people know barack obamas vision for our country and that they are engaged in the political process
3030861 the campaign has never really left the state its just not had a formal office and organization on the ground
3030862 han kan bygga en hel spelning p hits och tvekar inte att rada upp dem en efter en han beh ver inte vara sv r han ger och f r dans hyllningar och sk ns ng till tack
3030863 most of us are working extra hours all the time
3030864 this summer with the number of vacations that have to be covered and the shortage of pharmacists a lot of pharmacies are reducing their hours during slower periods like on weekends just to get by basically
3030865 to take this incident and promote fear over this breed of dog i think is really unjust and unfair
3030866 my hope is that you dont pass a ban on that dog
3030867 the state of michigan currently has a law that if an animal kills another animal or a child they are to be put down
3030868 the owner of these dogs is fighting this wants them to live to do it again im sure
3030869 theres going to be a show cause hearing to make a determination on whether or not these two animals these two pit bull mixes should be euthanized
3030870 i dont believe in breed specific bans and i never thought that this sort of ban would ever be considered in the city of allen park
3030871 if any of these people have ever had one of their dogs bound over a chain link fence and come at them baring their teeth they would understand the concerns of the citizens who are worried about the pit bulls who arent handled properly by their owners
3030872 the dog was taken into the house and then forced its way through the screen door and chased me home after they pulled it off of me
3030873 about two months later it did the same thing to a gentleman walking a labrador retriever
3030874 i think something should be done before this happens to someone else
3030875 i never saw such viciousness in my entire life i think that any of these women or men that could have stood there and watched this take place without being able to move one foot for fear of their own life i think they would look very differently on this
3030876 we didnt know who the owner was they were not tagged not licensed and there are a lot of dogs in this community that are not licensed how do we know where they are what they are we dont because people dont register their dogs
3030877 i always question why dont we hear the warm fuzzy pit bull stories
3030878 i was going to bring my dog to the meeting today
3030879 to have somebodys dog be killed by another is really really bad
3030880 there are viable alternatives to look at besides just the breeds
3030881 this is just the first phase of gathering data to make the right decision

3030887 with barack obama his becoming president is them becoming president because michelle was there from the beginning
3030888 id wear a v neck shift and a two inch heel even if the president were taller i would keep them low otherwise it gets a little too sexy
3030889 in the end the first lady should be her mans rock and his boulder and his mountain and she should be calling about 50 percent of the shots
3030890 i started calling all these people and everybody was talking to me like i was crazy theyre like well he hasnt won yet but im like yes he has because hes gotten this far i think he gives everybody so much hope
3030891 what gives me tears is if barack obama wins kids are going to say a black man can be president too
3030892 i am not going to realistically be the policy expert on every opinion and position that barack has because i dont have the time to do it quite frankly and i have to be okay with that

3030901 we missed out on a good opportunity to beat sri lanka
3030902 we did really well in galle to come back and we did not capitalise on the winning of the toss here you cannot lose five wickets in the first 40 overs of a test that happened to us quite regularly in this series which is something we need to think about
3030903 for a new batter to go straightway and face two spinners it is never easy
3030904 people who got starts if they had converted it would have been a different story i do not want to give excuses overall we did not play quality cricket to win the series
3030905 it is not just one or two players who we should blame
3030906 it is important that everyone contributes i do not think there was enough contribution throughout the series from the middle order consistently even the lower order did not contribute consistently except one game here that is obviously something that let us down
3030907 thats still a lot of time for us to think and reflect on what went wrong
3030908 the person who trusts me will not only do what i am doing but even greater things because i am giving you the same work to do that i have been doing

3031015 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3031016 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3031017 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3031018 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3031019 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3031020 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3031026 all in all this is an above average comedy fantasy romp from an author that may just appeal to you if you like fantasy romantic comedies that are amusing but not too over the top amusing
3031027 weve all had the experience of wanting to ask a question and regretting not doing so when the moment has passed
3031028 when it comes to topics such as history people can often be embarrassed to voice their queries but the only way to learn is to ask
3031029 lurching to the right then the left the old washington dance whatever it takes
3031030 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3031031 si del cielo te caen limones aprende a hacer limonadas
3031032 m s vale p jaro en mano que 100 volando
3031033 dime con qui n andas te dir qui n eres
3031034 si mahoma no va a la monta a la monta a va donde mahoma
3031035 el que naci para martillo del cielo le caen los clavos

3031037 people see that theres a wounded moose in their midst i remind them its like a pack of wolves circling the moose it took the first wolf to strike to start bringing it down the fact is im the one who was out there when it didnt look possible i frankly think thats the kind of representation people need
3031038 dianes opposition to the war and disgust at the poor treatment of veterans like her son prompted her to challenge long serving congressman don young in 2006 under funded and without national support diane gave him the closest race he had faced in decades she was willing to take him on again before his ethical troubles gained traction and other democrats decided to enter the race
3031039 i think people are always scared of somebody who challenges their values
3031040 i believe i have challenged the values of the party im asking them to really step up to what they claim to be and sometimes thats tough for people not just in terms of the issues which is one thing theres a certain safety net in a good ole boy network insiders support insiders too often and trying to break up the game its like standing in front of a bunch of guys who are watching monday night football on the tv set good luck
3031041 you really take a beating out here when you run for office i can tell you that
3031042 you have to be thick skinned enough you have to be tough enough to put up with this every single day its not to say that every day is really bad its not its just that its a grueling exercise its like being interviewed for a job repeatedly 24 7
3031043 how many women with a political bent come from money or arent already overextended
3031044 most women i know and many brilliant women are overextended with taking care of families communities and community obligations as well as their jobs
3031045 grew up in logging camps boarding schools foster homes and even on boat houses
3031046 i could prove that i could do the job and the union stood up for me
3031047 and they stood up for me time and time again and i will never forget that
3031048 my family has a strong history of military participation and you know were proud of it
3031049 and on the other hand we dont and i dont see us just going to war at the drop of a hat or at somebodys whim
3031050 i know what it is to mobilize and to bring them home thats a major undertaking im familiar with that just because ive watched the movement of our troops especially when i was following my sons movements when he was serving over there it takes time and strategy to safely redeploy them we need to prepare for that step right now and plan the withdrawal right now
3031051 strong diplomacy and work with other nations to solve some of these problems i dont want to see us just caught up in only military solutions as our knee jerk response to every problem or trouble that comes into the world
3031052 what stands out the most one im not a career politician and two i really do want to clean up government and that to me means you dont take money from industry lobbyists and industry pacs because if you do want to clean up government it should probably start with the campaigns
3031053 were speaking to how good having lobbyists really is and that they take that money without expecting to be beholden to them
3031054 being a politician is the only profession in america where youre required to take money from strangers and pretend you dont owe them anything
3031055 i figure you know when was the last time a career politician went to washington and became less indebted to special interests
3031056 i mean lets ask that question to me its like sending an alcoholic to a bar to sober up when we look at the make up of congress what do we see we see a lot of millionaires and a lot of lawyers and how much of the peoples interests are being represented over big special interests
3031057 people are very sensitive right now about what the future holds and are rather frightened for it
3031058 when we have here in this day a resource rich state people who are suffering in poverty we have a large homeless population in the anchorage vicinity i would doubt that any of my opponents have done what ive done i have visited the prisons i visited the homeless shelter ive spoken to treatment groups about drug and alcohol issues i have spoken with elders at luncheons on issues that affect them particularly the families and issues of homelessness and poverty in this state are not favorite issues as a matter of fact it rarely comes up
3031059 our biggest threat this winter as alaskans is the lack of fuel and just heating oil for homes across especially in the rural areas of alaska and i think where we might differ is how i am more understanding and committed to rural alaska than any of my opponents could possibly be and i dont know if thats just because i understand it so well from growing up in rural alaska having lived a good part of my life out there and coming from that kind of background knowing what it is to subsist i grew up with that none of my opponents have grown up with subsistence nor have they had to
3031060 you could send that system out to all of the villages we have over 200 villages they could have fresh produce that they grow that serves the community they could use it however they want do they want to sell it to their community do they just want to feed their community its so simple and it would support certain transportation costs to those rural communities they wouldnt be threatened by being weathered in and running out of food i mean it solves so many problems i cant believe not one other person has talked about this
3031061 it is a list of rights that no president and no congress have the right to take away
3031062 you know i was frustrated because im a democrat we need more democrats who are willing to take a stand like that rather than having democrats that cave or end up being called bush kinds of democrats
3031063 and its very troubling to me to see anybody frankly regardless of party compromise our civil rights and our civil liberties if its about justice for people about whats right human rights matter to me maybe because i grew up so much without that ive become very sensitive to the rights of fellow human beings
3031064 i was on a trucking crew on the south side it was a new crew and i was the last truck to come in
3031065 there were about 30 trucks all lined up and instead of saving me a space on the end where i could park my rig they saved a space in between two rigs
3031066 ensconcing the corporate insurance and pharmaceutical industries formally into law
3031067 the company no longer exists and the campaign fund to which the money went is vacated
3031068 strong diplomacy and work with other nations to solve some of these problems i dont want to see us just caught up in only military solutions as our knee jerk response to every problem or trouble that comes into the world
3031069 nocera calculates that if 9 billion people in 2050 used energy at the rate that americans do today that the world would have to generate 102
3031070 conservative estimates of energy use place our global energy need at 28 35 tw in 2050
3031071 the message is clear the additional energy we need in 2050 over the current 13 5 tw base is simply not attainable from long discussed sources the global appetite for energy is simply too great
3031072 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
3031073 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
3031074 given the magnitude of the problem of fueling the future with carbon neutral energy nocera argues that the only real alternative for carbon neutral energy production is some form of solar power more energy from sunlight strikes the earth in one hour than humanity uses in a year but converting sunlight into energy useful to people is a huge unsolved technological problem in 2000 author richard rhodes and nuclear engineer denis beller calculated that using current solar power technologies to construct a global solar energy system would consume at least 20 percent of the worlds known iron resources take a century to build and cover a half million square miles clearly a lot of technological innovation needs to take place before solar becomes an option for fueling the world
3031075 earth receives 174 petawatts of incoming solar radiation insolation at the upper atmosphere at any given time when it meets the atmosphere 6 percent of the insolation is reflected and 16 percent is absorbed average atmospheric conditions clouds dust pollutants further reduce insolation traveling through the atmosphere by 20 percent due to reflection and 3 percent via absorption these atmospheric conditions not only reduce the quantity of energy reaching the earths surface but also diffuse approximately 20 percent of the incoming light and filter portions of its spectrum after passing through the atmosphere approximately half the insolation is in the visible electromagnetic spectrum with the other half mostly in the infrared spectrum a small part is ultraviolet radiation
3031076 the total solar energy available to the earth is approximately 3850 zettajoules zj 1 x 10 21 joules per year oceans absorb approximately 285 zj of solar energy per year winds can theoretically supply 6 zj of energy per year biomass captures approximately 1 8 zj of solar energy per year worldwide energy consumption was 0 471 zj in 2004
3031077 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
3031078 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
3031079 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
3031080 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
3031081 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
3031082 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
3031083 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
3031084 in addition to those killed many more service members have received painful shocks
3031085 i have never seen a contractor given that position of estimating costs and scrubbing dcaas numbers i believe they are treading on dangerous ground
3031086 this confirms the house oversight and government reform committees worst fears kbr has repeatedly gouged the taxpayer and the bush administration has looked the other way every time
3031087 investigators say that current war fraud runs into untold billions including faulty ammunition and vehicles and not so bullet proof vests investigative officials and the inspector general for iraq reconstruction have testified that theyre hampered by the ongoing conflicts and need more time to catch contract thieves after they end the justice department meanwhile is reportedly sitting on a backlog of more than 900 cases in which in both military and domestic spending long delays bog down the information in secrecy as the department understaffed and overloaded weighs whether the allegations have merit according to the washington post on both the war front and the home front the government must do a far more convincing job of going after profiteers who are gouging the taxpayers
3031088 but many of the oil companies now stepping forward to benefit from iraqi oil were instrumental in both supporting bushs political career and giving advice to cheneys secretive energy task force in 2001
3031089 by the summer of 1999 bush had already raised 37 million but he wanted to conserve his campaign cash so he turned to a texas crony ray hunt to help fund the iowa effort
3031090 in july of 1999 hunt was among a handful of bush supporters who each donated 10 000 to the iowa republican party
3031091 it won a 126 000 award for ammunition for the special forces aey also provided ammunition or equipment in 2004 to the department of energy the environmental protection agency the transportation security administration and the state department
3031092 the important thing is that theres a diversity of opinion in the american jewish community theres no monolithic view theres an argument and thats what j streets about its about the fact that we deserve representation too in this debate we understand that there are a substantial number of american jews who hold very right wing positions when it comes to israel and they should have a voice in the public policy process but theres also a very substantial number of american jews who hold very moderate views on israel and they also need a voice and we should have that argument just like we do on any other public policy issue without resorting to name calling without labeling one side antisemitic or self hating jews and all of that we should discuss the merits
3031093 if you have three jews over for brunch on a sunday and you say what flavor bagels should i buy youll end up buying 10 bagels because people will have all sorts of different opinions
3031094 but if you ask what do you think about israel youre only allowed to give one opinion its just not jewish its not part of the fabric of our society that we dont argue that we dont have different opinions that we dont see the nuance i mean thats what it means to be jewish right
3031095 never before have candidates received tangible political support for agreeing that pursuing both a two state solution to the israeli palestinian conflict and aggressive diplomacy to solve political conflicts in the middle east should be central to american foreign policy
3031096 these endorsements and the will open up much needed political space needed for honest discussion of american foreign policy and for debate over what policies are in fact in the best interests of both the united states and of israel
3031097 the whole thrust of the j street effort is not quite yet understood which is that its a political effort
3031098 at the end of the day this isnt really about the substance of the issue because theres not a substance problem here most members of congress actually get the issue now and they understand what we should be doing theres just no political space for anybody to actually say it out loud and start to lead and so i think at times people still are fighting the fight over the substance and want to talk about the substance when in reality j street is all about the politics this is a political problem and j streets a political solution were putting votes and resources behind candidates who are willing to change the political space
3031099 i think that what there is clearly agreement on is people understand that a militaristic approach to conflicts with political roots isnt the right answer
3031100 and if you close the doors of members offices and you talk to them and you talk to their staffs it is very clear that they do understand these issues and they do understand what would be a good direction for foreign policy and it is clear that if they had the political space the outcomes would be different for example im not sure that j street would endorse a direct us government approach to hamas but shouldnt there be quiet diplomacy taking place between intermediaries and third parties shouldnt the us get out of the way if israel wants to talk to hamas which it obviously has done shouldnt it not discourage egypt and other entities from playing useful roles absolutely and i think you would find support for that set of policies
3031101 theres no question that one of the most important issues in the coming months that relates to the middle east and american foreign policy is how were going to deal with iran
3031102 weve been really clear that we do not support a first resort to military means to counteract the threat for iran we believe there is a real threat you know were not going to dismiss the fact that this guy who runs iran is a lunatic and that it is dangerous for people like this to have nuclear weapons we are adamantly opposed to the development of nuclear weapons by iran but we think the current policy has been a complete failure and we should be trying a different approach to creating political space for opponents and to creating political opportunities in iran and at least giving assertive diplomacy a shot before we move straight to the military option
3031103 it is very important and weve made clear from the get go that this is not an anti aipac effort
3031104 because there are a lot of people who support aipac and who do it out of very goodhearted reasons so we are really consciously not anti aipac we are against the fact that the debate on israel has been hijacked by the right wing thats right wing christian zionists right wing neoconservatives rightwingers who run major jewish organizations but its not all aipac the truth is so much more complex and it actually doesnt serve anybodys purpose to make this about aipac because its about the policy its about whats best for israel its about whats best for the united states
3031105 we dont have 30 years to build up a force of equal size and sophistication what we need is a smart focused strategy that maximizes bang for the buck we cant do everything the other side does we cant match every organizer every campus group every conference what we can do is draw strength from the knowledge that the policy makers and politicians actually know whats right on this issue they just need political space to say it thats why we are focused on 1 the demonstrative impact of providing to only a handful of races rather than trying to be engaged everywhere 2 building an online list as quickly as possible since political change is going to be driven from the net in the coming years and 3 creating a lobby whose purpose is to show members that there really is support for these positions among their existing constituencies and donors
3031106 weve been really clear that we do not support a first resort to military means to counteract the threat for iran we believe there is a real threat you know were not going to dismiss the fact that this guy who runs iran is a lunatic and that it is dangerous for people like this to have nuclear weapons
3031107 because there are a lot of people who support aipac and who do it out of very goodhearted reasons so we are really consciously not anti aipac we are against the fact that the debate on israel has been hijacked by the right wing thats right wing christian zionists right wing neoconservatives rightwingers who run major jewish organizations but its not all aipac the truth is so much more complex and it actually doesnt serve anybodys purpose to make this about aipac because its about the policy its about whats best for israel its about whats best for the united states
3031108 at least giving assertive diplomacy a shot before moving straight to the military option
3031109 this is a political problem and j streets a political solution were putting votes and resources behind candidates who are willing to change the political space
3031110 never before have candidates received tangible political support for agreeing that pursuing both a two state solution to the israeli palestinian conflict and aggressive diplomacy to solve political conflicts in the middle east should be central to american foreign policy
3031111 swapping live terrorists for dead soldiers israel gets back its boys
3031112 jun 30 2008 19 29 updated jul 1 2008 10 17
3031113 youre right the palestinian people have and are suffering and you are correct they did endure a nakba 60 years ago and there is an important lesson there
3031114 the jewish leadership accepted the resolution but the palestinian and arab leadership did not which they had a right to do what they did not have a right to do was attack the nascent jewish state with the objective as they acknowledged at the time of initiating a war of extermination the result was therefore a double nakba not only of palestinian arab suffering and the creation of a palestinian refugee problem but also with the assault on israel and on jews in arab countries the creation of a second much less known group of refugees jewish refugees from arab countries
3031115 jewish refugees from arab countries the case for rights and redress
3031116 finally we come to the principle of retroactive validity this is perhaps the most compelling one that may operate in favour of mr bush and his coalition if the war uncovers weapons of mass destruction exposes iraqs deception and is supported by the iraqi people it may well be that the legal niceties surrounding the use of force will be overtaken by post invasion validation
3031117 by reporting that iran halted its nuclear weapon development program four years ago because of international pressure the new national intelligence estimate makes a compelling case for less saber rattling and more direct diplomacy
3031118 the new national intelligence estimate shows that george bush and dick cheneys rush to war with iran is in fact a rush to war
3031119 i view this report as a warning signal that they had the program they halted the program the reason why its a warning signal is they could restart it
3031120 another war is just not where we want to go
3031121 to understand the real weight of military keynesianism in the american economy today however one must approach official defense statistics with great care
3031122 after obama becomes president iran will have the nuclear weapons they can develop quickly
3031123 and what about israel aipac has been urging congress to attack iran for years and was one of the principle groups spreading false intelligence concerning irans non existent nuclear program that was debunked by the nie if iran really has no nuclear program why do the powers that be in israel want us to attack iran
3031124 as for john lowell please think of the supreme court and what will happen to it if another conservative becomes president i wish nader had chosen a few election cycles ago to run as a democrat that would have been an interesting debate or maybe for congress but we cannot afford any more justices like alito and roberts
3031125 barack is doing what he has to do to get elected how he actually governs is quite another matter
3031126 i suspect as obama settles in to office serious proposals to reform our election system including publicly funded elections for all federal positions will get passed this leaves aipac and all lobbyists out in the cold in which the 527 route is the only route left until the supreme court changes the scope of protected free speech or there is a constitutional amendment to do the same
3031127 the problem is that if you dont vote for obama or mccain you still get one of them and this time around which you get makes a difference
3031128 you must challenge your own cynicism and doubt or you become part of the problem rather than the solution
3031129 he gazed up at the enormous face forty years it had taken him to learn what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache o cruel needless misunderstanding o stubborn self willed exile from the loving beast two gin scented tears trickled down the sides of his nose but it was all right everything was all right the struggle was finished he had won the victory over himself he loved big brother
3031130 lowell what is ralph naders position on abortion and why do you support it
3031131 it is 6 of one and half a dozen of another stopping iran will cause a lot of problems as you have pointed out but do we wait and then one day wake up and find a lot of the world has been nuked by the crackpot running iran
3031132 rushing to deploy a technology that does not work against a threat that does not exist
3031133 if we can responsibly deploy missile defenses that would protect us and our allies we should but only when the system works we need to make sure any missile defense system would be effective before deployment the bush administration has in the past exaggerated missile defense capabilities and rushed deployments for political purposes the bush administration has also done a poor job of consulting its nato allies about the deployment of a missile defense system that has major implications for all of them we must not allow this issue to divide new europe and old europe as the bush administration tried to do over iraq
3031134 currently over 120 000 people have signed on and the simultaneous actions this weekend all over the world have created more momentum for this movement protests hunger strikes and letter writing campaigns were held in athens brno czech republic turin madrid albacette spain amsterdam munich milan florence valencia reykjavik rome toulouse koln budapest malaga brussels and guadalajara in the us there were actions in new york city saint paul bangor and brunswick maine blue hill nebraska albuquerque tucson and california
3031135 mocks mr putins dream of eventually restoring russian hegemony over eastern europe
3031136 make russia whole if it joins in our iranian boycott
3031137 but while the americans and the czechs recently concluded their negotiations the polish government has balked at the us terms on offer insisting on large scale military aid from the us to modernise its armed forces in return for agreeing to host the silos for 10 interceptor rockets
3031138 we are not aware of any complaints of illness from our many customers of travel trailers over the years including travel trailers provided under our contracts with fema
3031139 on march 20 2006 you received a statement this was before you issued the no complaint statement and ill quote there is an odor in my trailer that will not go away it burns my eyes and i am getting headaches everyday ive tried many things but nothing seems to work please please please help me how do you square your statement to cnn we are not aware of any complaints of illness made in april 2006 with a statement from a customer in march that was a complaint had you received any complaints before april 2006 when you issued your statement to cnn that you had had no complaints
3031140 the complaints related to this matter that we received were two
3031141 so the answer to my question is yes you had received complaints prior to april but you told cnn you had no complaints correct
3031142 and we were speaking of our history with fema as a program sir
3031143 sir thats a justification for saying something that was untrue
3031144 so i agree with my republican colleagues when they say this is a failure of government government should have set standards but i also think this is a failure of industry
3031145 because some of you did testing and you found that there was a problem and that was the end of it several of you didnt do any tests at all even though reports were coming out about high formaldehyde levels in trailers causing people to be sick
3031146 the level at which acute health effects begin to appear in healthy adults
3031147 the level at which osha requires medical monitoring of employees
3031148 the level that epa says no one should be exposed to for more than eight hours in a lifetime
3031149 gulf stream never told any family living in its trailers about its test results the company did spend a month carefully crafting a letter to fema about the test results
3031150 the formaldehyde levels in the eleven occupied trailers fall below the osha standard
3031151 the taxpayers paid 2 billion for trailers that now have to be scrapped as junk
3031152 just full disclosure in the room were in right now were at 80 parts per billion if you need to leave let us know
3031153 i havent seen any evidence that they violated any rule and havent done their job to perfection im kind of disappointed that we have you four here beating up on you
3031154 our country is becoming mired in a culture of mediocrity and a failure to be empathetic to human beings so we can talk about standards here there and everywhere but the question still remains do we get what we bargain for or are we getting something that does harm
3031155 his usual role of unpaid party visionary by arguing that we can ease the climate crisis the economic crisis and the crisis of dependence on foreign energy all at once
3031156 that the technology for alternative fuels wind solar and geothermal is far more advanced than we realize
3031157 when we look at all three of these seemingly intractable challenges at the same time we can see the common thread running through them our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change but if we grab hold of that common thread and pull it hard all of these complex problems begin to unravel and we will find that were holding the answer to all of them right in our hand the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3031158 my bill picks up in a sense where california left off
3031159 california and oddly enough new jersey are the leaders in the country in providing incentives to help people and businesses put up photovoltaic units on their roofs california had a 10 year 1 million rooftop project were saying that we can do 10 million rooftops in the course of 10 years now number one if you do that it provides a helluvalot of electricity which means you dont need coal burning plants it means you dont need nuclear power plants number two what rooftop electricity does it really makes people more conscious about sustainable energy in a way that even solar thermal plants wont because thats just another power plant the idea of having rooftops all over this country producing electricity is i think an extraordinary thing youre going to have 10 million individuals homeowners businesses involved in producing electricity so i think this will aid in improving our consciousness about how we utilize electricity how we produce it and so forth and the goal also is not only producing the electricity its when you start using that much photovoltaic the cost of that stuff is going to go down
3031160 right now on the drawing board people dont know this but there are about a dozen plans for the southwest these are called concentrating solar plants or sometimes people call them solar thermal plants these are the same technology electricity generating technology as coal or gas the same bloody thing except the fuel now is from the sun there is one plant that pacific gas and electric plans to build within a couple of years that will provide electricity one plant for 400 000 homes the equivalent of a small nuclear power plant so there is huge potential in concentrating solar
3031161 turns out to be an optimal place to on the planet
3031162 so when gore says that in 10 years we should produce 100 of electricity from sustainable sources 20 of that can come just from there
3031163 and then you can have another huge amount from photovoltaics then you got wind then you got geothermal then you got biomass it is a doable deed
3031164 the country that is probably leading the world in photovoltaics i believe is germany
3031165 germanys solar exposure is worse than vermonts it is a technology that can be used in 50 states photovoltaics can work and its important to know that because the notion that it cant is a myth
3031166 its certainly not going to happen under the bush administration
3031167 heres where i think were at if we have a president if senator obama is prepared to do what al gore just was talking about yesterday and to understand that one we have a planetary crisis number two that the importation of hundreds of billions of dollars of oil from dictatorships in the middle east is a geopolitical disaster its a major economic problem if obama is prepared to make this a major priority gore was talking about the man on the moon analogy other people talk about the manhattan project analogy if hes prepared to do that then these 10 million rooftops become absolutely part of that its part of an overall energy approach to deal with greenhouse gas emissions and by the way environmental concerns were focused on greenhouse gas emissions we forget that this coal is making a lot of people sick as well of course there will be economic dislocation and we want to protect the coal miners who will lose their jobs but at the same time you are going to create major industry after major industry in terms of sustainable energy i think at the end of the day we create millions of jobs in net and its absolutely an economic win its a question now of taking on the fossil fuel industry and the huge amounts of lobbying money and campaign contributions at the end of the day we can reverse global warming we clean up the environment we create good jobs we break our dependence on foreign oil hey thats a pretty good agenda huh
3031168 turns out to be an optimal place to on the planet
3031169 just wait oil will drop and well forget all these silly ideas of free energy
3031170 the way i and most common working folks see it the only thing immature is those asking other people to pay for your vision
3031171 as ive said before when you libs decide to shovel big money to subsidize whatever ill be there to collect your tax money and laughing all the way i did it w adm when ethanol was still peaking sold at fat profits before ethanols fraud became more evident heads i win tails you lose no fantasy
3031172 chaos derived from disruptive technologies hurricanes earthquakes tax policies subsidies mass hysterias herds heading over the cliffs thats what i thrive in
3031173 its very costly and very inefficient for society as a whole
3031174 policy makers will have to decide if the benefits are worth it
3031175 it began in the early 1950s when the israeli government encountered a fuel supply shortage and restricted the times when water could be heated in response the people decided that they would start heating their own water using solar panels by 1983 60 of the populated were using solar panels and a law was eventually passed making what was already a common practice a law regulating that all new houses be installed with a solar water heater
3031176 fuel consumption in ancient rome was even more profligate than in classical greece in architecture the romans remedied the problem in the same fashion as did the greeks vitruvius the preeminent roman architectural writer of the 1st century bc advised builders in the italian peninsula buildings should be thoroughly shut in rather than exposed toward the north and the main portion should face the warmer south side varro a contemporary of vitruvius verified that most houses of at least the roman upper class followed vitruvius advice stating what men of our day aim at is to have their winter rooms face the falling sun southwest the romans improved on greek solar architecture by covering south facing windows with clear materials such as mica or glass they also passed sun right laws that forbade other builders from blocking a solar designed structures access to the winter sun
3031177 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
3031178 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3031179 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3031180 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
3031181 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
3031182 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
3031183 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3031184 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3031185 this is far better than what george bush was doing previously in which the attorney general would determine on his own when there was a need for a warrant
3031186 so i think it is time to move on and trust that president obama will have the power to allocate sufficient resources so that all wiretaps have prior court authorization
3031187 when the hell is someone going to stand up to this dictator
3031188 to pass strict scrutiny the law or policy must satisfy three prongs first it must be justified by a compelling governmental interest while the courts have never brightly defined how to determine if an interest is compelling the concept generally refers to something necessary or crucial as opposed to something merely preferred examples include national security preserving the lives of multiple individuals and not violating explicit constitutional protections second the law or policy must be narrowly tailored to achieve that goal or interest if the government action encompasses too much over inclusive or fails to address essential aspects of the compelling interest under inclusive then the rule is not considered narrowly tailored finally the law or policy must be the least restrictive means for achieving that interest more accurately there cannot be a less restrictive way to effectively achieve the compelling government interest but the test will not fail just because there is another method that is equally the least restrictive some legal scholars consider this least restrictive means requirement part of being narrowly tailored though the court generally evaluates it as a separate prong
3031189 because of the nature of our work the nations editors columnists and contributors routinely engage in telephone and e mail communications with individuals outside the us
3031190 yeah lets fight the governments ability to listen on the phone calls of people who want to kill americans hey i have an idea lets stop checking bags at the airport as well because thats an invasion of my privacy
3031191 hey i havent done anything wrong who cares if they listen to terrorists
3031192 lets also remove all surveillance cameras from airports train stations gas stations convenience stores malls supermarkets parking lots and office buildings because they are watching the good guys as well as the bad guys thats not fair wahhh wahhh i feel so violated
3031193 the new statute permits the nsa to intercept phone calls and e mails between the u s and a foreign location without making any showing to a court and without judicial oversight whether or not the communication has anything to do with al qaeda indeed even if there is no evidence that the communication has anything to do with terrorism or any threat to national security
3031194 so i dont understand why we need to listen to more conversations and get more info to pay no attention to and we still dont inspect cargo coming into our ports its more important to spy on phone calls and who were they spying on before 9 11
3031195 a plaintiff bringing a facial challenge to a statute on first amendment grounds however must nonetheless establish an injury in fact sufficient to satisfy article iiis case or controversy requirement
3031196 the overbreadth doctrine does not apply where there is no significant difference between the claim that the ordinance is invalid because of overbreadth and the claim that it is unconstitutional when applied to the plaintiffs own activities
3031197 top court rejects aclu domestic spying lawsuit supreme court decision doesnt explain reason for turning down appeal the associated press updated 11 40 a
3031198 its very disturbing that the presidents actions will go unremarked upon by the court
3031199 in our view it shouldnt be left to executive branch officials alone to determine the limits
3031200 so the aclu and the nation are going to court so terrorist can continue to plan their terrible deeds i hope people remember this when the day comes god forbid that we are hit again by al qeada and if that terrible day comes i hope the reputation of both the aclu and the nation is destroyed forever because in the name of blind progressive values they risked the security of the nation shame
3031201 there were many good senators who showed courage in standing up to the white house and for the constitution
3031202 the shining light when it comes to the media the way its intended to be in this country
3031203 the recovery is under way as planned according to his clubs physicians
3031204 alleviating poverty and protecting civilians from violence are essential components of a strategy to bring peace and stability to the country unless the next american president builds on the existing commitments to help lift the afghan people out of extreme poverty and protect civilians it will be impossible for the country to achieve lasting peace
3031205 it is important for us policy in general and for obama more specifically to recognize that simply putting more troops into afghanistan is not the entire solution
3031206 we are running the risk of repeating the mistake the soviet union made our strategy is getting in deeper and deeper
3031207 the temptation to throw more military forces at the problem in a replication of the iraq surge for many it is becoming clear that it cannot be won framed in military terms
3031208 obama has shown how capable he is of good judgment
3031209 and i believe that the success will be fairly easy
3031210 theres no doubt in my mind that we will be welcomed as liberators
3031211 theres not a history of clashes that are violent between sunnis and shias so i think they can probably get along
3031212 look were going to send young men and women in harms way and thats always a great danger but i cannot believe that there is an iraqi soldier who is going to be willing to die for saddam hussein particularly since he will know that our objective is to remove saddam hussein from power
3031213 but the fact is i think we could go in with much smaller numbers than we had to do in the past but any military man worth his salt is going to have to prepare for any contingency but i dont believe its going to be nearly the size and scope that it was in 1991
3031214 hes a patriot who has the best interests of his country at heart
3031215 you believe that the people of iraq or at least a large number of them will treat us as liberators
3031216 well then why was there a banner that said mission accomplished on the aircraft carrier
3031217 my friends the war will be over soon the war for all intents and purposes although the insurgency will go on for years and years and years
3031218 the systematic brutality the widespread atrocities the ruthless suppression of independent thought
3031219 merely superficially recorded let alone documented let alone acknowledged let alone recognized as crimes at all
3031220 you wouldnt know it it never happened nothing ever happened even while it was happening it wasnt happening it didnt matter it was of no interest
3031221 bad money reckless finance failed politics and the global crisis of american capitalism
3031222 the integrity efficiency orderliness and competitiveness of financial markets and maintain investor confidence
3031223 instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity and thereby increasing the danger of inflation the fed could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market thus stabilizing the market as a whole
3031224 shadowy body with powers to support stock index currency and credit futures in a crash
3031225 an informal agreement among major banks to come in and start to buy stock if there appears to be a problem
3031226 ready to coordinate intervention by the federal reserve on an unprecedented scale the fed supported by the banks will buy equities from mutual funds and other institutional sellers if there is evidence of panic selling in the wake of last weeks carnage
3031227 we must not rule out military force against long standing adversaries such as iran and syria
3031228 at moments of great peril in the past century our leaders ensured that america by deed and by example led and lifted the world that we stood and fought for the freedom sought by billions of people beyond their borders
3031229 we are not a debate society or a protest movement our goal is to have a friend in the white house
3031230 the u s israel relationship is the single most important determinant of democracy in the world and we must commit to securing it
3031231 it is so obvious to us that the jewish community is a family and that we have to take care of each other
3031232 there is a tremendous amount of love in this place
3031233 it is we that are the guardians of that relationship
3031234 do we know them do they know us have they been to israel do they understand the issues we care so deeply about
3031235 but how about finding the one right person to reach out to candidates for communities like muscle shoals alabama or tacoma washington or council bluffs iowa ladies and gentlemen the success or failure of the pro israel community rests on three words our personal relationships
3031236 i can personally attest that senator obama is a genuine friend of israel
3031237 fulfilled a pledge he made to the chicago jewish community
3031238 i see palestinian negotiator saeb erekat a lot more than i see my wife and kids
3031239 i worry a lot more about the american jewish community than i do about israel about which i have grave doubts
3031240 my biggest hope is for peace i believe in talking to them i dont believe in wiping them out
3031241 me also thinks that given that the iraq war is looking to be a us republican win magic wants to claim a war victory of his own in afghanistan after all to have an on going war he didnt start and to finish it with a win that bush 43 may not and likely will not accomplish has got to be super tempting for the first black potus perhaps wishful thinking on my part that well exit afghanistan with another win magic may turn tail just as his liberal genes may dictate lol
3031242 tribal law with the custom of hospitality and the vendetta in many forms are rules of life and even the settled afghan is very much a soldier
3031243 if elected senator barack obama has the possibility of reengaging with a world that seeks an america which isnt defined by abu ghraib or guantanamo
3031244 the uk can no longer rely on us assurances that it does not use torture and we recommend that the government does not rely on such assurances in the future
3031245 we also recommend that the government should immediately carry out an exhaustive analysis of current us interrogation techniques on the basis of such information as is publicly available or which can be supplied by the us
3031246 she points out just how different this very backward country is compared to iraq most afghanis are illiterate for one and the much more insurgent friendly terrain with very few paved roads
3031247 containing soviet communism said brzezinski dictated an avoidance of anything that might split islamic opposition to the soviets especially a u
3031248 what is more important to the history of the world
3031249 after 2001 the bush administration appeared to sign on to the neoconservative declaration that the world was defined by a clash of civilizations and launched its global war on terrorism targeting al qaeda the most virulent strain of the very virus that the united states had helped create
3031250 the next 15 years may well be the age of superterrorism when they the islamic terrorist ed gain access to weapons of mass destruction and show a new willingness to use them
3031251 the war against terrorism is a war with an unlimited number of battles none of them decisive what price are we prepared to pay the price will be financial and personal people will have to accept longer lines before entering buildings longer delays at airports more intrusive searches of belongings and our persons and higher ticket prices to pay for all of this greater vigilance will also involve a willingness to compromise some of our civil liberties including accepting more frequent phone taps and surveillance those who would resist paying such a price should keep in mind that terrorism could well get worse in the coming years there is evidence that the terrorist challenge is entering a new phase
3031252 as america becomes an increasingly multicultural society it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues except in the circumstances of a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat such a consensus generally existed throughout world war ii and even during the cold war it was rooted in a cultural and ethnic affinity for the predominantly european victims of hostile totalitarianisms in the absence of a comparable external challenge american society may find it much more difficult to reach agreement regarding foreign policies
3031253 the process of transformation even if it brings revolutionary change is likely to be a long one absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new pearl harbor
3031254 why more had not been done to take defensive measures in response to the threat reporting over the spring and summer
3031255 she told the commission the public wasnt prepared to support president bushs effort to take drastic action against al qaeda
3031256 rumsfeld acknowledged the spike in reports of possible al qaeda attacks in the spring and summer of 2001 saying there was a good deal of concern
3031257 the whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed and hence clamorous to be led to safety by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins all of them imaginary
3031258 six or seven men can plunge the nation into war without consulting parliament at all
3031259 england scotland wales and especially northern ireland are today little more than slave plantations and social engineering laboratories serving the needs of the city of london these families constitute a financier oligarchy they are the power behind the windsor throne they view themselves as the heirs to the venetian oligarchy which infiltrated and subverted england from the period 1509 1715 and established a new more virulent anglo dutch swiss strain of the oligarchic system of imperial babylon persia rome and byzantium the city of london dominates the worlds speculative markets a tightly interlocking group of corporations involved in raw materials extraction finance insurance transportation and food production controls the lions share of the world market and exerts virtual choke point control over world industry
3031260 the trade of venice was overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of the jews the wealthiest of the mercantile class
3031261 have made themselves so closely connected with the british peerage that the two classes are unlikely to suffer loss which is not mutual so closely linked are the jews and the lords that a blow against the jews in this country would not be possible without injuring the aristocracy also
3031262 there would be no modern state of israel without british freemasonry in the 1860s the british israelite movement was initiated from within freemasonry its goal was to establish a jewish masonic state in the turkish province of palestine initially british jewish masonic families like the rothschilds and montefiores provided the capital to build the infrastructure for the anticipated wave of immigration however luring the jews to israel was proving difficult they simply liked european life too much to abandon it so europe was to be turned into a nightmare for the jews
3031263 there are people who control spacious territories teeming with manifest and hidden resources they dominate the intersections of world routes their lands were the cradles of human civilizations and religions these people have one faith one language one history and the same aspirations no natural barriers can isolate these people from one another if per chance this nation were to be unified into one state it would then take the fate of the world into its hands and would separate europe from the rest of the world taking these considerations seriously a foreign body should be planted in the heart of this nation to prevent the convergence of its wings in such a way that it could exhaust its powers in never ending wars it could also serve as a springboard for the west to gain its coveted objects
3031264 we the bankers must proceed with caution and guard every move made for the lower order of people are already showing signs of restless commotion prudence will therefore show a policy of apparently yielding to the popular will until our plans are so far consummated that we can declare our designs without fear of any organized resistance the farmers alliance and knights of labor organizations in theunited states should be carefully watched by our trusted men and we must take immediate steps to control these organizations in our interest or disrupt them at the coming omaha convention to be held july 4th 1892 our men must attend and direct its movement or else there will be set on foot such antagonism to our designs as may require force to overcome this at the present time would be premature we are not yet ready for such a crisis capital must protect itself in every possible manner through combination conspiracy and legislation the courts must be called to our aid debts must be collected bonds and mortgages foreclosed as rapidly as possible when through the process of the law the common people have lost their homes they will be more tractable and easily governed through the influence of the strong arm of the government applied to a central power of imperial wealth under the control of the leading financiers people without homes will not quarrel with their leaders history repeats itself in regular cycles this truth is well known among our principal men who are engaged in forming an imperialism of the world while they are doing this the people must be kept in a state of political antagonism the question of tariff reform must be urged through the organization known as the democratic party and the question of protection with the reciprocity must be forced to view through the republican party by thus dividing voters we can get them to expand their energies in fighting over questions of no importance to us except as teachers to the common herd thus by discrete action we can secure all that has been so generously planned and successfully accomplished
3031265 on sept 1st 1894 we will not renew our loans under any consideration on sept 1st we will demand our money we will foreclose and become mortgagees in possession we can take two thirds of the farms west of the mississippi and thousands of them east of the mississippi as well at our own price then the farmers will become tenants as in england
3031266 we live in a social environment that is operating at the height of ignorance because we constantly condemn that which we do not investigate why do we condemn it because it is beyond our ability to perceive it and we constantly constantly misunderstand the difference between the limits of our perception of possibilities and what is actually possible and when we do that we enter a mind prison that allows the chosen few to control the many
3031267 fictions are necessary to the people and the truth becomes deadly to those who are not strong enough to contemplate it in all its brilliance in fact what can there be in common between the vile multitude and sublime wisdom the truth must be kept secret and the masses need a teaching proportioned to their imperfect reason
3031268 zionism is but an incident of a far reaching plan
3031269 it is merely a convenient peg on which to hang a powerful weapon

3031271 state sponsored terrorism the jesuit elders need to advance their agenda amonst the public
3031272 earlier at 4 57 pm the bbc reported that wtc 7 had collapsed 23 minutes before the event occurred if anyone wonders whether there is any collusion between the intelligence agencies the government and the mass media i cannot imagine a better example
3031273 is there an enormous large screen outdoor television in the west bank that would enable palestinians to view these events as they are happening
3031274 we are not your problem the palestinians are your problem
3031275 everybody knows that the dice are loaded everybody rolls with their fingers crossed everybody knows the war is over everybody knows the good guys lost everybody knows the fight was fixed the poor stay poor the rich get rich thats how it goes everybody knows
3031276 it is the only food product you can buy with an expiration thats 50 years
3031277 the most important thing is for us to find osama bin laden it is our number one priority and we will not rest until we find him
3031278 i dont know where bin laden is i have no idea and i really dont care its not that important its not our priority
3031279 in two surprising recent cases a law school professor and a circuit court judge seek to revoke the charters of corporate lawbreakers we know what the death penalty for individuals means commit an egregious crime die at the hands of the state what does it mean to talk about the death penalty for corporations simply this commit an egregious wrong and have your charter revoked in other words lose the states permission to exist its an intriguing concept because most of us never think about corporations needing anyones permission to exist but they do throughout the nations history the states have had and still have the authority to give birth to a corporation by granting a corporate charter and to impose the death penalty on a corporate wrongdoer by revoking its charter activist author richard grossman points out that in 1890 for example new yorks highest court revoked the charter of the north river sugar refining corporation referring to the judgment explicitly as one of corporate death it was once widely understood that the states had this power new york ohio michigan and nebraska revoked the charters of oil match sugar and whiskey trusts in the 1800s grossman wrote in the pamphlet taking care of business citizenship and the charter of incorporation co authored with frank adams for many decades now this vital power has lain dormant in the public mind but a small group of activists led by grossman is hoping to resurrect it they believe that to stem the tide of growing and unaccountable corporate power its not enough to rely on regulation litigation legislation and law enforcement grossman and his cambridge based project on corporations law and democracy want citizens to reclaim the power to put corporations to death
3031280 the social contract has been broken and should be rewritten to reflect current economic realities
3031281 here in the first decade of the twenty first century the story that becomes americas dominant narrative will shape our collective imagination and hence our politics in the searching of our souls demanded by this challenge kindred spirits across the nation must confront the most fundamental progressive failure of the current era the failure to embrace a moral vision of america based on the transcendent faith that human beings are more than the sum of their material appetites our country is more than an economic machine and freedom is not license but responsibility the gift we have received and the legacy we must bequeath
3031282 obama got 166 minutes of coverage in the seven weeks after the end of the primary season compared with 67 minutes for mccain
3031283 answer me this obama is recieving the support of 98 of the black community will he be in their debt if elected and how will the payoff manifest itself
3031284 oh screw it let obama and the libruls ruin everything and well get a real conservative in 2012
3031285 oh screw it let obama and the libruls ruin everything and well get a real conservative in 2012

3031287 breaches of his fiduciary duties involving multiple conflicts of interest
3031288 but the 9 11 people want the truth behind these murders
3031289 i am not giving up these murderers just keep on lying more and more it will break open one day not too far in the future
3031290 this new york federal court is supposed to be one of the most distinguished in the nation
3031291 but it doesnt take any more than a glance at this order to see its utter intellectual bankruptcy and one could reasonably suspect that the true motivation for the order is to suppress ellen marianis ongoing efforts on behalf of 9 11 truth
3031292 judge hellerstein also took the unusual steps of closing both the case that ellen had filed in 2001 the first wrongful death case filed against the airlines after 9 11 and the case that had been filed by her stepdaughter lauren peters
3031293 when i saw the judges order closing these two cases and spoke with ellen and i realized that she had not been provided any details on a settlement we both smelled a rat
3031294 hillary was my first choice based largly upon the time she spent as co president with bill
3031295 obama is recieving the support of 98 of the black community will he be in their debt if elected and how will the payoff manifest itself
3031296 obama is recieving the support of 98 of the black community will he be in their debt if elected and how will the payoff manifest itself
3031297 if you are part of a call from al qaeda or hamas or hezbollah you deserve to be listened to
3031298 a wildly deregulated reckless free market that has socialized losses
3031299 oh people can come up with statistics to prove anything kent 14 of people know that
3031300 yeah hes a cantankerous old fart but at least he know you cant tax your way to prosperity hopefully hell die in office quickly
3031301 but what happens if one country has more of the commodity to sell than someone else or has easier access to it or decides to monopolize it
3031302 unequal democracy the political economy of the new gilded age
3031303 80 percent of net income gains since 1980 went to people in the top 1 percent of the income distribution
3031304 the real incomes of working poor families at the lowest 20th percentile of the income distribution grew six times as fast when democrats held the white house
3031305 it was nerve racking but were happy with the result
3031306 only four of the seven parties invited made a bid the rest presumably realised early on that they couldnt compete all four live locally any city slickers looking for a country retreat were left by the wayside this time the underbid was 1 45m the hammer price was 1 46m
3031307 it was right at the end of the summer so we knew it probably wasnt going to sell over the winter
3031308 come spring when we thought things would pick up we only had trickles of interest we reduced the price to 550 000 but that didnt seem to have any effect so we put it on with other agents and reduced the price again to 525 000
3031309 we said that we couldnt keep cutting the price so he had to drop out
3031310 weve had to put it on the market again wed love to sell it and fulfil our dream going to malaysia but all i can see is that winter is coming again
3031311 the lower price bands tend to be more affected in the south with the under 500 000 and 500 000 1m categories seeing the worst decline
3031312 but they are not legally binding and in a flaky market buyers get cold feet and pull out even after a successful sealed bid private auctions are fair and transparent and you get closure thats attractive to both sellers and buyers in this market
3031313 the more discretionary sellers will move out of the market and there will be low supply to match low demand creating stability
3031314 buyers will head for quality so if youre going to get the transaction through you need to be sure youve minimised the risks people will buy the best property they can in the price bracket theyre looking at even if you have a great house you might have to be prepared to accept a bit less for it but its more likely to sell
3031315 you have to bring the property into a new band of buyers
3031316 if you have a property on at 595 000 reducing it to 575 000 is going to do no good at all you need to bring it down to 550 000 which is in the range of people looking at the 500 000 market
3031317 try to accommodate your buyer and offer flexibility in the sale
3031318 if that means delayed completions or reducing the price because work needs doing between exchange and completion its worth it to hold the deal together
3031319 recently we helped a couple who were living with a small child in a riverside flat in east london
3031320 they had these two huge electric blue sofas in a really big open plan reception room with windows looking out over the river when you walked in all you saw were the sofas and you didnt notice the view we told them to put them into storage then furnished the whole flat in a contemporary style it sold really quickly
3031321 tidy up your front garden pop out to the garden centre and buy some plants make sure the doorbell works people always forget that one
3031322 ive seen places that people were trying to sell with dirty underpants all over the place and washing everywhere
3031323 youd think it would be blatantly obvious but no dont leave your washing up piled in the sink its just the basics
3031324 a lot of people are quite lazy they like to walk in and know they dont have to do much
3031325 switch all your lights on when showing someone around no matter what time of day it is and place table lamps to get rid of dark corners
3031326 its important to try to give the impression of a show home
3031327 people like to have someone who knows the area and youll be able to point out details and create a nice atmosphere
3031328 i agree with those who have said our olympic team is an embarrassment we must be leading the world in 8th and 9th place finishes did you see the opening ceremonies we had one of the biggest teams there and what do we get
3031329 deported from china so you had to get kicked out and not want to leave on your own free will maybe we can get lucky and the athletes get kicked out too that way we can have a good reason why we have no medals did you take a look at the countries ahead of us
3031330 hope canada will have a medal this time even zimbabwe georgia each has a medal even north korea dprk has 3 medals
3031331 no medals have been awarded in the 2008 summer games for rowing
3031332 no medals have been awarded in the 2008 summer games for cycling track
3031333 the result is a lopsided foreign policy that antagonizes the rest of the world and is ineffective in tackling many modern problems
3031334 it is essentially impossible to wage an economic war against al qaeda and its affiliates or to pursue a military strategy of containment without at the same time harming muslim states and populations whom we do not want to harm
3031335 sempre foi fiel representa o de planos aut nomos e independentes e multiplicidade de olhares sobre um objecto

3031357 i checked in every blog that protested against the forum and they just talk about conversion to islam and it ends there
3031358 some leaders or members of the three parties feel the need to out islamise each other
3031359 for me the 300 protesters who were outside protesting do not represent the majority muslims or islam
3031360 such violent acts only give a bad image of muslims and malaysian society surely does not tolerate these extremist or terrorist actions
3031361 the police should not have bowed to the aggressive tactics that forced the abrupt termination of a peaceful and mature dialogue
3031362 the fact was that based on the programme three of the five panelists were muslims

3031366 we rescue thousands of animals every year but you dont expect to be rescuing crabs in the midlands about as far from the coast as its possible to get in the uk
3031367 the first involved a large shore crab found walking down the middle of the road in winson green in birmingham but sadly he didnt survive
3031368 were hoping that this isnt the start of a worrying new craze for bringing crabs back from holiday especially with our seaside resorts reporting a bit of a resurgence this year
3031369 law enforcement operations like this should reassure the public that ice is committed to putting public safety first every individual targeted as part of this operation has a criminal record
3031370 criminal aliens should be on notice that ice is working closely with local law enforcement to take off the streets those who threaten the very safety of our neighborhoods
3031371 we appreciate the efforts of immigration and customs enforcement in its efforts to remove illegal individuals with extensive criminal records from our community
3031372 indicative of the ability of the agencies to work cooperatively together to achieve a common goal of public safety in our community
3031373 i would like to commend and thank all the law enforcement agencies on the local state and federal level who participated in this effort gang related activities and those who choose to partake in them do so knowing full well the negative impact their actions can have on the neighborhoods throughout our fine city we hope this weeks arrests will call attention to our never ending commitment to combat suppress and prevent future gang related behavior
3031374 that take into account the environment the health of consumers and the working conditions of people in the fashion industry
3031375 people often perceive the fashion world as superficial so its great to work with materials that are actually good for the environment i had my doubts but when we actually saw the fabric swatches we were blown away they were gorgeous and it wasnt hard to design with them

3031403 when we sat down we realized we didnt really know what we wanted to do with it
3031404 the main problem from the original was that people tended to fall into a circular emotion around the arena which was the most efficient way to shoot things but wasnt particularly a fun way to play the game
3031405 to counteract that we added the geoms the collectible score multipliers left by defeated enemies into the game and that made people start dodging through the enemies it made them get more aggressive
3031406 the original reason for putting those in was because the narrow beam forced you to play offensively
3031407 the wide beam forced you to play defensively it was the game itself trying to force you to play differently but with the addition of the geoms we didnt really need that in there
3031408 were tying to gauge how good the player is and trying to speed the game up if theyre doing really well or slow the game down if theyre not
3031409 its all very balanced and not exploitable in any way
3031410 allows us to put many more enemies on the screen at the start but keep the difficulty very low because these things are easy to dodge and easy to shoot it makes the game feel busier at the start even though its not actually that much more difficult
3031411 in the first iteration of the gates the ends killed you they would get bigger and smaller so they actually touched
3031412 there was no real skill involved in getting through a gate
3031413 we tried it in waves but that was a bit insane
3031414 geometry wars retro evolved 2 was to present to players only the modes with the most
3031415 bizarre really wanted me to leave a cheat in there so people could see the game was actually in 3d but there was always a worry that people were going to exploit it in some way
3031416 but then somehow we accidentally left the de bug cam era fly cheat in
3031417 we have enough game ideas to do geometry wars for probably about 10 games it depends on what will work

3031435 i was impatient and too eager to win in the first game when my score was 16 19 i knew i had a chance to win first game
3031436 i regret because this is my last olympic games as i am already 32 years old i expected to be in the top eight but its a pity i could not get there
3031437 i did not want to stretch myself in the second game once wang got an early lead so i let her win and gave it my best in the third i wanted to make her play slowly because she likes to play fast

3031471 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3031472 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3031473 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3031474 our strategy is to focus on our core assets improve our balance sheet and invest in higher growth products and areas of the media business canwest president and chief executive officer leonard asper said
3031475 when reviewing our properties we determined that the prospects for fm radio in the u k were not consistent with the companys long term growth strategy
3031476 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3031477 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3031478 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3031479 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3031480 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3031494 many people get regular bouts of dizziness and short breath so those with serious illness take these symptoms for granted until its too late
3031495 we havent found out any effective solutions to create jobs for people when brick kilns close
3031496 although brick kilns cause a lot of damage to the environment and health it is really difficult to stop their operation
3031497 it would be much better if we could persuade the owners to improve the facilities and equipment of the brick kilns and to use gas instead of coal forcing them to stop just wont work

3031547 wishes to place on record that no less than 90 of the communications that he receives from stockholders relate to postings that stockholders have read on internet message forums there is absolutely no doubt that a number of parties are desperately trying to cause this company and its stockholders great damage all of which is both sickening and despicable
3031548 that this company will under his leadership continue to honor its promises to its stockholders be as open and transparent with stockholders as is permitted by law and that should stockholders be concerned over what they read on these message boards they should check the facts with himself prior to acting on these postings
3031549 that he has remained detached from and will not be drawn into this murky world that exists on these internet message boards with these so called paid bashers and their barrage of personal attacks and despite stockholder requests to the contrary he will no longer discuss this issue with his stockholders in any further announcements whatsoever
3031550 he was eternally grateful to the very many loyal stockholders who have been and continue to support both himself and the company

3031555 i dont think any of these boys will be foolish enough to demonstrate at the olympic games
3031556 needless to say given the bank failures this doesnt come as a surprise or a shock the fdic could have explored other funding options but given the scope of the insurance funds claims a premium increase would make the most sense at this time
3031557 checking and savings deposits at fdic member banks are insured up to 100 000 per depositor per bank backed by the insurance fund and as a last resort by the u s government
3031558 what frustrates me is the feeling that everything has already been said and published that all rational argument has been used yet it does not help
3031559 trend toward abandoning scientific objectivity in favor of political agendas
3031560 reason environmental extremism emerged was because world communism failed the berlin wall came down and a lot of peaceniks and political activists moved into the environmental movement bringing their neo marxism with them and learned to use green language in a very clever way to cloak agendas that actually have more to do with anticapitalism and antiglobalism than they do anything with ecology or science
3031561 i think if we dont overthrow capitalism we dont have a chance of saving the world ecologically
3031562 this is the great moral test of our generation are we actually going to leave this planet and america better for our children than we found it
3031563 why have we not addressed the issue of climate change and global warming
3031564 ill tell you why no question about it oil companies gas companies power companies and the lobbyists in washington d c we have to have a president who will stand up to these people
3031565 we simply must do everything we can in our power to slow down global warming before it is too late the science is clear the global warming debate is over
3031566 americans are coming to understand that global temperatures have actually cooled over the last 10 years and are predicted to continue cooling over the next 10
3031567 if you look from 1995 you dont see any change that could be regarded as statistically significant for the last 13 or 14 years nothing has been happening

3031572 pendidikan politik masih perlu dilakukan saat ini sehingga rakyat indonesia benar benar mengerti akan kondisi demokrasi yang sebenarnya sedang dihadapi bangsa ini sehingga turut berperan menentukan masa depan bangsa
3031573 ini bukan berarti rakyat golput tetapi mungkin saja disebabkan karena kesadaran politik rakyat semakin tinggi
3031574 kekuatan kekuatan dalam masyarakat perlu melakukan kritik terhadap para pelaku politik seperti ini kalau tidak rakyat berhak mencari tokoh tokoh lain maupun partai politik lain yang lebih memiliki visi dan misi untuk membangun bangsa di masa mendatang
3031575 pimpinan lima perusahaan tersebut berkomitmen menghormati ketentuan pokok perjanjian karya pengusahaan penambangan batu bara pkp2b termasuk bila ada tunggakan pembayaran royalti
3031576 tetapi permintaan pengusaha atas pembayaran restitusi pajak dari pemerintah juga masuk akal karena lima perusahaan itu berstatus
3031577 status istimewa perlu untuk ditawarkan pemerintah indonesia saat ini karena semua perusahaan batubara ketika itu adalah perusahaan asing sehingga tunduk pada peraturan investasi yang berbeda dengan perusahaan lokal
3031578 di sinilah sumber perbedaan di antara pemerintah dan pengusaha dalam menginterpretasikan pkp2b generasi 1

3031592 there was a long protracted series of text messages that culminated in the offence
3031593 it is a series of messages followed by a series of threats
3031594 well take the slap the kick in the teeth its certainly hurtful but the bottom line is if youre going to defend like that youre going to concede goals
3031595 clarke coming back next week for the ipswich game will help us enormously and equally well still try to get the other players in
3031596 weve been trying to strengthen at the back and well continue to do that
3031597 i think the defending was nothing short of naive to begin with
3031598 you would certainly have never envisaged being 2 0 down within three and a half minutes
3031599 brian laws will be delighted for sheffield wednesday but from our point of view they were really soft goals
3031600 i can accept being beaten and i can accept somebody working really hard to score a goal against you but i dont think sheffield wednesday had to work particularly hard for any of their goals i left the players in no uncertain terms about that
3031601 you would never have envisaged losing the goals that we did
3031602 we got back in and we were certainly the team in the ascendancy
3031603 but we lost a very poor goal as far as im concerned on the counter attack
3031604 we asked at half time to take the game to wednesday at the start of the second half which they did and we had a few opportunities but couldnt quite get the goal to make it 3 2
3031605 we lost a goal from a throw in for want of a better phrase it looked like schoolboy defending
3031606 whether they were feeling sorry for themselves at 3 1 down but thats not what we need
3031607 the combination of deepening weakness in europe and asia coupled with an appreciating u s currency may jeopardize any hopes of a decent us recovery especially if protracted dollar strength erodes the vital contribution from net u s exports exports minus imports on u s gdp growth

3031611 we have ice cream from all over japan from hokkaido in the north to okinawa in the south but beef tongue has been the one that people keep coming back for
3031612 i think japanese people always want to try new things and ice cream is always very popular when it is this hot in the summer
3031613 japanese people dont always have a dessert after a meal but recently many japanese housewives have got into the habit of buying ice cream because it is easy to serve and refreshing in the summer
3031614 we evaluated the effects of several micronutrients and only vitamin e was significantly associated with decline in physical function
3031615 the odds of declining in physical function was 1 62 times greater in persons with low levels of vitamin e compared with persons with higher levels
3031616 it is unlikely that vitamin e is simply a marker for poor nutrition because our results are independent of energy intake and the effect of low levels of other micronutrients was not significant our results suggest that an appropriate dietary intake of vitamin e may help to reduce the decline in physical function among older persons since only one person in our study used vitamin e supplements it is unknown whether the use of vitamin e supplements would have the same beneficial effect
3031617 in my lab we have been working for a long time on proteins that use cysteine as a reactive oxygen sensor
3031618 with this new technique we discovered scores of novel proteins that are sensitive towards reactive oxygen species interestingly we found that many of the proteins that we identified are important for the cells to survive oxidative stress conditions
3031619 our study showed that functions can be maintained in older animals so long as damaged proteins continue to be efficiently removed strongly supporting the idea that protein buildup in cells plays an important role in ageing itself
3031620 even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
3031621 most people with these conditions are born with a mutation that gives rise to defective proteins but they dont experience symptoms until later in life
3031622 we think thats because their protein clearance systems can handle abnormal proteins when the person is younger but get overwhelmed as their efficiency falls with age by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time
3031623 users will be able to manipulate simulate touch and literally immerse themselves in data in a way they never have been able to before
3031624 the brain absorbs a lot more information when its presented in pictures rather than in stacks of data from a computer
3031625 the pattern is so subtle that its imperceptible but in this rendition the resolution is fine enough that i can easily see it
3031626 you can go right up to streamlines in a fluid or dig into a reservoir and see which way its flowing
3031627 thats the direction we would like to move in you can imagine all kinds of other uses for something like that
3031628 imagine the difference between simulating a virtual environment on a computer screen and one on a visualization wall the difference is tremendous
3031629 thats what large scale visualization gives us a capacity to create a richer immersion experience
3031630 the music bizs big five sony bertelsmann emi universal and time warner which control 85 percent of the 15 billion cd market settled with the ftc wednesday on charges that theyve been leaning for years on music retailers to fix cd prices by threatening to withhold promotional budgets from stores that dont adhere to a so called
3031631 during the brief time i worked at dc it was interesting to contrast morrisons proposals to others morrisons proposals were always driven by economics and re establishing brand identity this is what dc comics are good at this is an untapped market need these characters are valid trademarks and can perhaps be rehabilitated into spin off childrens cartoons im not clear whether morrison can take this approach because of his high level of authority within the dc creative structure or whether morrison attained his high level of authority because of that economically minded approach but for all of his reputation as a madcap drug addled sentimentalist his approach is extremely mercenary nobody else apparently gave any thought to such matters in pitching new series and it shows
3031632 all theyre giving me is red bee pitches rag man and red bee pitches
3031633 ill see you your obscure mini series for one blockbuster superman series
3031634 anyone that tells you that drilling makes the disc run cooler is smoking crack
3031635 at one time the conventional wisdom in racing circles was to cross drill brake rotors to aid cooling and eliminate the gas emitted by brake pads
3031636 if you cross drill one of these vented rotors you are creating a stress riser that will encourage the rotor to crack right through the hole
3031637 what are the benefits to crossdrilling slotting and zinc washing my rotors in years past crossdrilling and or slotting the rotor for racing purposes was beneficial by providing a way to expel the gasses created when the bonding agents employed to manufacture the pads however with todays race pad technology outgassing is no longer much of a concern slotted surfaces are what baer recommends for track only use slotted only rotors are offered as an option for any of baers offerings
3031638 crossdrilling your rotors might look neat but what is it really doing for you well unless your car is using brake pads from the 40s and 50s not a whole lot
3031639 anytime you can take a streak of historical significance and personally be responsible for its conclusion thats a tremendous credit to the individual responsible for bringing the streak to its end
3031640 by and large ive done a tremendous job ending streaks and i know in my heart of hearts that i am more than capable of bringing this one to an end as well
3031641 i made no secret about my ambition to flip that culture in lincoln
3031642 and it took me very little time to do just that to take a 10 win program and flip it to a 5 win program within one years time i think it takes a certain level of competence to achieve such a turnaround unfortunately there were those involved in that particular program who did not have the intellectual capacity to grasp the difficulty of such a milestone
3031643 and im not sure if youve heard of it its called the super bowl and ive coached in it to be particularly candid and blunt i have little interest in coaching a football team in any bowl other than the super bowl and i think my performance has been consistent with that philosophy
3031644 my biggest personal disappointment is that i was not able to end the streak of sellouts at memorial stadium
3031645 the streak is clearly the byproduct of living in an isolated state where intellectual stimulation is difficult to obtain ending that streak would have been a tremendous accomplishment a feather in my cap if you will in terms of changing the atmosphere of that state away from childish football adulation and into a more sophisticated intellectual scenario
3031646 your typical fan or reporter lay people tend to focus more on how certain techniques and alignments appear on the football field to their own naked untrained eye
3031647 but they have little appreciation or regard for how certain zone blocking philosophies appear when diagrammed to perfection on paper
3031648 has already started around new york but at least one cast member is still living his alternate non upper east sider life through august 24
3031649 oh god oh dylan it must be cold down there it is cold enough on top in november the dirtiest month of the year that killed you on the ninth vile day if only i could take you a bowl of your bread and milk and salt that you always drank at night to warm you up
3031650 oh you dont know how to do this question therefore you suck

3031652 ok wackos go down to your local hardware store and buy a 12 gauge shotgun and then find a group of lefties and wing em
3031653 arent you people satisfied yet you live in a country where you dont have to walk eight miles for kindling or water what are you bellyaching about
3031654 its the fault that this moron did what he did so let me use that as a tool to promote my own conflicting agenda
3031655 however housing activity is definitely on a downward trend consistent with indications of deteriorating affordability through last year this factor is expected to keep new residential construction activity under pressure going forward our forecast assumes that starts will drop on average 5 3 per cent this year and 14 8 per cent next year
3031656 his lung was sheared from its wall cavity his spleen severed liver lacerated pelvis shattered and his left arm was broken
3031657 they sent him home with an open wound in his abdomen and had left his arm to heal on its own surgery wasnt an option in his condition
3031658 when my sons doctor recommended an osteopathic physician i figured that i had nothing left to lose i would have tried anything
3031659 i thank the doctors at county for giving back my sons life and i thank tsai for giving him his quality of life back
3031660 both degrees allow the graduate to become fully licensed physicians the only difference is that dos spend additional hours in medical school learning how to touch patients and learning how to evaluate them as whole people
3031661 research shows that even dos who dont perform manipulation still spend more time with patients than the average mds
3031662 of course there will always be some mds and dos who are exceptions
3031663 some people still think of me as a voodoo witch doctor
3031664 which is pretty frustrating since i spent seven years in medical school
3031665 i recommend that patients always try a non surgical approach but sometimes it becomes clear that surgery is the only option for a patient
3031666 when a patient continues with osteopathy or physical therapy because they are afraid of surgery i see that as a huge problem
3031667 during that time i still believed in the validity of my manipulation skills that mds dont have
3031668 sixty five percent of my patients come to me for omt and i believe that it is successful i wasnt about to give that up
3031669 but they find ways to do it anyway often insurance companies will classify omt as physical therapy and only partially cover treatments or limit the number of sessions that they allow that means that i have patients who cant afford to see their treatments through to the end
3031670 most of my patients are people who have been suffering with chronic pain for a long time many of whom are considering surgery
3031671 sometimes surgery is necessary but sometimes it is avoidable its sad that the alternative isnt accessible to everybody
3031672 big insurance companies are always looking for ways to justify keeping their money
3031673 i cant help but think that if one of those stars got on tv and talked about omt my phone would be ringing off the hook
3031674 but they are also the ones who struggle the most to pay for it
3031675 it was just obvious right away this was something we could definitely do together and were going to do together no matter what
3031676 scott and toby have been writing together for so long theres a backlog maybe ill try to get a song on the next album
3031677 none of us were making those recordings as if they were demos
3031678 that was the world of recording for us at that time and we got as much out of it as we could
3031679 i think people just appreciate the sincerity and the realism of what they do
3031680 there is something so surreal and vulnerable about them yet so approachable and friendly it has been truly remarkable to watch them grow but the best thing is that it never feels too polished or fake they have maintained the scrappiness that attracted me to them in the first place
3031681 they are more genuine and passionate than about 99 9 percent of bands living the dream right now
3031682 i never feel like theyre doing it halfassed its really authentic
3031683 we put it in and just listened to it for the entire summer they were immediately my favorite band
3031684 its clear and i think safe to say at this point that were a band that musicians respond well to
3031685 they sound like real singers people that really love to sing as opposed to people that you kind of wonder why theyre singing
3031686 whenever you see harmonies with more than two parts onstage and harmonized guitar solos thats definitely shooting for some band dudes hearts if you can pull it off tastefully
3031687 we had a jolly roger we put that up i guess to show our rebel nature in the town of west chester
3031688 when he came back toby and scott knew okay were back together
3031689 paleontologists and raccoon were always kind of an alternate avenue
3031690 toby really thought of himself as a bass player and scott thought of himself as a guitar player
3031691 early on the thing was anyone could be in dr dog
3031692 everybody was involved everyone got a dr dog name starting with a t toothbrush was mcmickens then girlfriend sharon curleys name and that happened to be written on the cd they gave to jim james
3031693 it was like me and toby forever almost like this two headed beast
3031694 and the first two people who came and filled in the picture couldnt have been more different doug is like a monument to this timelessness and tradition of music and ted is just completely out in outer space about it
3031695 you put those together and that to me is the dr dog ideal an awareness of your history and a bold sense of abandonment
3031696 they had a batch of songs mostly tobys and i just started playing with them more and more it just sort of existed on its own
3031697 we all sat down there with a four track and each wrote a song spontaneously they were embedded with all these weird little sound effects like delay pedals and distortions it was a stoned kind of idea there was all this tape manipulation and a lot of giggling
3031698 they were the sloppiest band id ever seen the drummer was horrible and yet i found myself humming the songs
3031699 the drumming was a problem for so long it solidified them as a full band
3031700 it was awesome traveling around to great places and signing autographs
3031701 but it was a little bittersweet i did the tour as sort of a last hurrah it was clear they were going to start requiring everyones full attention i was committed to the doublehorse guys which had never been an issue before we had always played in all these bands
3031702 it just stemmed from my absolute obsession with the beach boys i lived and breathed it so wed sit around and learn some of those harmony parts
3031703 it might sound like the most annoying thing in the world but at some parties it would be a whole room of people singing the beach boys
3031704 this was the guy for this role much more than i was
3031705 so i knew the band was great and that scott and tobys relationship was the rock of the band
3031706 but with a little bit more freedom and a little bit more gusto to make the most of that and there was just enough of an outlet to keep you satisfied in west chester
3031707 living in the city can be a bit of a distraction but there you had to make your own fun so a lot of adventures started that way
3031708 dr dog was a perfect opportunity to start something new
3031709 there were all these great bands in philly it felt like something happening that didnt have a label attached to it
3031710 it certainly doesnt hurt that were in the company of friends
3031711 and when the park the van guys talked about the music you got the sense they listened to it and understood it
3031712 between a great record and a much more able label
3031713 we didnt have to compromise in the mixing process we all belong had more arrangements and was on a grander scale but the way we recorded these songs made it feel more fleshed out and beefier
3031714 ive heard a couple people say that i guess my definition of prog is just slightly different from other peoples
3031715 i think it might be dark i was thinking about that the other day
3031716 i didnt ask as a challenge its just hard to really see that sometimes
3031717 i think its more about the intelligence behind their music thats more of a compliment than an insult
3031718 i think they get a bad rap for being derivative especially of the beatles but thats just good music i dont think its a character flaw
3031719 were not virtuosos were just stylists and that will only take us so far were never gonna be playing 17 minute songs
3031720 weve played some of those festivals but i dont think we ever really killed
3031721 whatever happens well try to be our best but to be honest were best at the khyber
3031722 for all of us the goal always was somebody has to get big these guys are doing it theyre doing it for all of us
3031723 i think its true weve never jumped a level weve never skipped a step its always been a lot of steps
3031724 you can accomplish anything in life provided that you do not care who gets the credit
3031725 when i got there it was like this is home this is where i want to be when i think of those first couple of months its like when you first fall in love with somebody everything is rosy it was good the way it felt the thought of ever leaving it or going away was kind of unbearable for me
3031726 a half iraqi half american in iraq months before this big invasions going to happen and im studying music its not a very plausible story
3031727 when i would say i was iraqi people would kiss me they wouldnt take cab fare from me and my arabic was good enough that i could sort of fake it they were so nice as soon as i mentioned america it was like oh screw america also inside of me i was feeling so much more connected to iraq at that time
3031728 for a long time i was struggling and then i was like ok im going to do sets the first will be maqam and the second set will be jazz but it started to come together
3031729 and the trumpet wasnt very interesting to me because of the context in public school its no wonder so many kids quit they show up and theres this disinterested band instructor playing very hokey music
3031730 it was the first time the trumpet was really cool
3031731 she came back and started learning to play arabic music wanting to learn the language
3031732 informationwise in terms of really learning the repertoire it was mostly in england
3031733 but if i had just gone to england without being in iraq i wouldnt have known how to relate to the music it was like soaking in the culture
3031734 i had never intended to perform iraqi maqam in its really true state because i didnt think i would be capable of it
3031735 it was an incredible experience i never sang in public except when i had a rock band as a kid and it was like being high its such a direct connection with the audience when you sing as opposed to when you play the trumpet or any other instrument because then its like youre meeting in some other realm like a third world when youre singing especially in arabic music because the words are so important you really make eye contact with people its like speaking but youre expressing something so much more powerful
3031736 i just didnt have any motivation for it at the time
3031737 once i accepted the idea it got more and more interesting
3031738 this rhythm if you play it a little differently it sounds like funk but its actually an old iraqi rhythm and this melody it really works well with that bass line the ideas started flowing
3031739 i want to see how each person relates to the material
3031740 most attempts ive heard using harmony with arabic music or any kind of modal music takes away from the melody
3031741 i didnt consciously do it but looking back it goes back and forth between these poles and it lets me feel both american and iraqi at the same time
3031742 i guess wolf parade is just another band its no favourite child or anything
3031743 it took us a while to figure out what we wanted to do and get the inspiration to make the record
3031744 there was a feeling of was there the will to do it
3031745 that was something we hadnt really done before it wasnt like apologies where dan and spencer put in song ideas
3031746 its not like we took a full year break of not playing music together
3031747 we were waiting to see what came up a direction that we really thought was interesting to us and then we sat down and started working out stuff this was a much more organic way of doing things
3031748 apologies songs are four years old now thats quite a bit of evolution since that record

3031982 last week i thought it would be interesting given that both the wall street journal and technewsworld had covered my professional relationship with dell regarding its new mp3 service to chat about what it would take to beat apple but in my analysis i left out one important thing apple is tricky already there are rumors of a redesigned ipod nano that would position well against this new dell offering and the apple funded sites seem to be aggressively trying to disparage this as yet unborn product someone seems scared to death of this as yet unborn product
3031983 apple funded sites seem to be aggressively trying to disparage this as yet unborn product

3031986 since we talked last week about how dell might create a successful service lets talk this week about the lengths apple might go to in order to stop them
3031987 apple has a set of top reporters that it feeds products to and who give it favorable reviews simply by spending time with them jobs can likely get them thinking negatively about dells new product and be primed to disparage it as soon as it actually launches though i doubt some will wait that long id be surprised if many arent already primed to go negative on this product even though it isnt finished yet
3031988 many arent already primed to go negative on this product even though it isnt finished yet
3031989 enderle apple funded sites already aggressively disparaging dell s as yet un stillborn mp3 player

3031997 ithink that google is starting to build its response saying were very trans parent
3031998 the major engines are holding a lot of valuable information on specific people
3031999 idont think that the general public has a sense of how much data the engines have
3032000 increased transparency in how the path toward greater customiza tion is achieved is of course of great assis tance to search marketers
3032001 the more content thats relative to the indi viduals search the more likely they will be to stay on that site

3032023 but god had the same choice 2 000 years ago with his son jesus christ and it paved the way for you and me to have eternal life thats the benefit i got thats the benefit james got and thats the benefit you can get if you accept jesus into your heart today as your savior

3032026 and the ransomed of the lord will return they will enter zion with singing everlasting joy will crown their heads gladness and joy will overtake them and sorrow and sighing will flee away
3032027 but christ has indeed been raised from the dead the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep
3032028 when you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature god made you alive with christ he forgave us all our sins 14 having canceled the written code with its regulations that was against us and that stood opposed to us he took it away nailing it to the cross 15 and having disarmed the powers and authorities he made a public spectacle of them triumphing over them by the cross

3032239 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3032240 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3032241 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3032242 had advanced from the breakaway region of abkhazia to the town of senaki inside georgia proper
3032243 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3032244 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3032245 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3032246 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3032247 never to get lost is not to live not to know how to get lost brings you to destruction and somewhere in the terra incognita in between lies a life of discovery
3032248 give give give what is the point of having experience knowledge or talent if i dont give it away of having stories if i dont tell them to others of having wealth if i dont share it i dont intend to be cremated with any of it it is in giving that i connect with others with the world and with the divine
3032249 dont ask yourself what the world needs ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go do it because what the world needs is people who have come alive
3032250 but among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality or of any kind of impurity or of greed because these are improper for gods holy people

3032268 if your success is not on your own terms if it looks good to the world but does not feel good in your heart it is not success at all the best way out is through christ christ is not valued at all unless he is valued above all if we cant believe god when circumstances seem to be against us we do not believe in him at all faith sees the invisible believes the unbelievable and receives the impossible we love you and support you just hold that in your heart that jesus the greatest love your kingdom friends are on your side since god is for you nothing is against you you are delivered all the freaking best

3032283 the nice thing is whatever minutes he can give me in a game are bonus minutes right now he has to get to a high level he knows it because of the talent level of the others
3032284 as he twists and turns his body things like that theres really not much hesitation

3032288 the evidence of this affair was right in front of the good old boys of main stream media but they looked the other way
3032289 just one year ago the company spent millions of dollars expanding into different markets and now they decided it was a mistake and shut down the expansion efforts
3032290 the irony of those decisions is that the very managers that made those decisions were not laid off but the talent that led the companys successes locally were all let go

3032311 people who farm now are not doing this for laughs despite the fact hollywood still thinks that theyre doing it to make a lot of money
3032312 theyre willing to kill anybody who gets in their way theyre taking money back to those who kill prosecutors judges and law enforcement
3032313 they come into our own national parks and risk the lives of sheriffs and others
3032314 theyre using family or very trusted family friends they dont just use anybody
3032315 youre recruited in for that purpose as long as youre trusted each person has his function
3032316 the people that are growing this are good at what they do
3032317 the goal is not just to eradicate the plants but to go after the organizations
3032318 in the past all weve been able to do is what we call whack and stack
3032319 were not just pulling the plants were targeting mid level and upper management of these trafficking organizations
3032320 often times we have people who will lead us to these gardens

3032340 the gjm is also found engaged in the dangerous game of indulging itself in acts of provocation to try to create segregation and then a rift between the hill people and the plains people this is an extremely condemnable heinous act and all such attempts at disruption of the peoples unity should be opposed by every democratic minded people this sort of destructive activity will serve to complicate matters at the time when there was a process started for a tripartite meeting between the central government the state government and the gjm up in delhi
3032341 we cant imagine the dressing room without bhutia as the leader
3032342 his presence is enough to lift the spirit of the players
3032343 under houghton the players have started believing in themselves and that has transformed our outlook
3032344 i wont say he houghton has changed me as a player or transformed me completely but with him around i always feel that i can learn a lot about football and that has made me all the more hungry
3032345 i am not setting myself any deadline i am once again enjoying myself and will want to play till i can do that
3032346 definitely once i stop playing i would like to be involved and be in a position where i can take decisions
3032347 i cant say whether i will be in that position but i would like to be in one since a player or a coach cant do much
3032348 wonderfully vulgar brilliantly performed and accented with action reminiscent of an 80s buddy film here track list for the indigo nights cd

3032376 the sabin vaccine which contains type 1 type 2 and type 3 is much less efficacious in tropical countries particularly in india
3032377 the why is not known but the observation has been consistent
3032378 if you increase the potency three times higher never expect a three times better response
3032379 maybe another five percent of 10 percent of children may respond
3032380 blaine is one of the most innovative chefs in the southwest
3032381 his ability to take traditional fare and transform it into something completely fresh and exciting is exactly what i have been searching for grace will give him the opportunity to set the definition for modern american classics
3032382 adam understands fort worth like no other restaurateur in the region
3032383 his vision for grace is one of the most exciting concepts ive seen experiencing a downtown renaissance fort worth is the place to be at the moment and adams restaurant will define the citys dining scene it is the right concept at the right time
3032384 a plan does us no good if it just sits on a shelf and the way it doesnt sit on the shelf is to fund it
3032385 if the plan just sits on the shelf i will take my vote back
3032386 and were about to see some tenant action on the property
3032387 eogs move in and transfer over there occurs over three months
3032388 moving people from here to there takes a little bit of staging we even have a schedule of elevator use its a big move and its a little bit of a logistical challenge
3032389 deals are done but there will be a joint announcement
3032390 we saw a very steady deliberate growth from them but i underestimated even in that building what they would take
3032391 no one questions that the oil and gas has significantly muted the downturn in the economys affect for fort worth
3032392 and i could see eog taking even more space or space being taken by another oil and gas company theyre filling the gaps left by a lot of folks who arent doing well these days and none of us is complaining
3032393 we split the two apart but then all the big box companies started coming in
3032394 i was on the payroll in 1961 when i was 11 years old
3032395 weve had a significant sales increase since suzy and i got involved
3032396 being a woman owned company gives us an edge its been a benefit to our clients government agencies and institutions like tcu who have diversity components
3032397 im working to help get our name out there to a new generation of clients
3032398 the 25 to 35 age group doesnt know much about furniture and office design with so many start ups and companies moving into town the opportunities are great to show them what we can do for them
3032399 with kelley suzy and charlies coming in theyre opening new avenues and a new potential customer base that we never attracted
3032400 the decision makers and those building companies are in charlies age group so its very important to educate them
3032401 were having a record year when dealers around the nation are struggling
3032402 its due to the strength of the fort worth economy our major clients have always been in health care defense and education and now energy companies thanks to the good old barnett shale
3032403 one of the things were focusing on is to keep our top 10 longest standing customers happy and to keep coming back
3032404 the high point with them was when we were thrown out of the tower during the 2000 tornado royer amp schutts immediately began to help provide us with the bare bones necessities they provided a key service for us and stepped up when we needed help the most
3032405 from pencils to desks they helped get us back in working order in no time since that time we will always use them for furniture and design needs we know theyre good folks they are fort worth they can compete with anybody across the state but they remain fort worth
3032406 the biggest change that weve seen is when dad and i used to sell a desk and a chair and a filing cabinet
3032407 were now offering complete office solutions a major part of our business is offering solutions to companies looking for leed certification
3032408 the problem i see is that since these transactions are not tracked we do not know what is stolen or legitimate
3032409 the figures reported to the police department do not include a lot of these transactions so the number of illegal transactions online is probably higher than originally estimated
3032410 with anything that has value to it we have people sign something to guarantee they are the owner of this item
3032411 so we do rely on the trust we have with the clients we work with
3032412 less than one tenth of one percent of our goods are stolen items
3032413 with this program pawnshops have become places where people can get their stuff back
3032414 this copper can be a product that he she does not need to take to a pawnshop but rather a metal shop that isnt heavily tracked like pawnshops
3032415 for a number of years these metal shops did not require any id for a person to sell off copper or metals now the local municipalities have stepped in and required sellers to provide a valid id and thumbprint for background checks

3032418 the world is a great book they who never stir
3032419 even if we have enough farm inputs like fertilizers if we dont have sufficient water supply in the growing of crops its useless because our crops primarily depend on water
3032420 based on reports reaching my office irrigated lands during the time of former president ferdinand marcos were not fully maintained only 50 percent of the total irrigated lands during that era remained as of this time
3032421 so im urging my fellow lawmakers heads of the concerned government agencies and non government organizations and local officials to embark on programs servicing farmers planting rice because our major concern today is food
3032422 we need to act now because our country is already far behind vietnam and thailand in terms of rice production sad to say the rice technologists from these countries learned from us when they studied agriculture in our prominent agricultural universities

3032428 i had seen his material and he was the best example of a dedicated working funny comic who made peoples lives that little bit better
3032429 just like little moments from the kings of comedy incorporating that into his show is probably the image im always going to have from him sitting in that chair and talking to america
3032430 the man was a genius i hope that at some point in my career that people think even half of me of what they thought of him
3032431 you dont want to lose a good employee because he or she cant be there at 8 a m
3032432 there should be a meeting to establish goals and define work
3032433 managers should come in at different times to see how things are going
3032434 we all have people who can do eight hours of work in five hours
3032435 have extra work they can work on it gives that person a chance to go above and beyond
3032436 why work sucks and how to fix it no schedules no meetings no joke the simple change that can make your job terrific
3032437 a results only work environment is where people are free to come and go when they want as long as their work gets done
3032438 you can text use e mail but we fall back on the old ways of having to communicate face to face

3032441 sometimes it seems like an administrative nightmare but its good for the employees
3032442 theyve seen what physical therapy has done for themselves a friend or a relative they have a personal connection to the field
3032443 therapists are also educators because we teach patients how to exercise regain function and avoid reinjury

3032451 when youre on a run like that you just have to milk it enjoy it we were able to get a lot of stops and from those stops we were able to score that got us going offensively
3032452 we knew the crowd was going to be in it so it was good to start better than we did against czech republic
3032453 the early numbers suggest that all of this is fueling more interest
3032454 get these kids to colorado springs and well get the medals
3032455 i think our bigger fear was that we didnt want to offend any religious people but looking at the discussion that unfolded from this thing what we had was a good sizeable group of players that we might call militant atheists and the rest of the players seemed very tolerant including all of the religious players
3032456 i didnt expect to hit hot buttons on the atheist side as much i expected it on the religious side
3032457 but so far ive had no critical feedback at all from anybody who is religious feeling that we were misrepresenting religion or it was bad to represent religion in the game it was really the atheists
3032458 anyone who wants to grow in their understanding and practice of biblical worship will benefit
3032459 hopefully once ive got over the disappointment ill learn and move on

3032470 newly obtained documents prove that in 2003 barack obama as chairman of an illinois state senate committee voted down a bill to protect live born survivors of abortion even after the panel had amended the bill to contain verbatim language copied from a federal bill passed by congress without objection in 2002 explicitly foreclosing any impact on abortion obamas legislative actions in 2003 denying effective protection even to babies born alive during abortions were contrary to the position taken on the same language by even the most liberal members of congress the bill obama killed was virtually identical to the federal bill that even naral ultimately did not oppose

3032472 at a time of rapid audience fragmentation audiences are keen on mass events which they can all watch together
3032473 ill make a prediction that the total number of individuals in the u k who watch these games will be at least 30 million over the fortnight or so of the games

3032476 lets say that you own an old sports car and you discover that the battery is dead your mission is to jump start it the most difficult part of this task is getting the car to begin rolling forward from its stationary position once you get the car moving from zero to one mile an hour it will be much easier to increase its speed this in turn helps the engine to turn over so that when you put the car into first gear the engine will start

3032520 the games industry takes from people the single most precious thing they have which is time its the one thing they cant ever get back and we suck hours and hours and hours away from people who could be using it to do other things
3032521 which is great im ridiculously enthusiastic about all this stuff and i think its brilliant
3032522 but we should stop and think and have answers ready for how we use that time and how people are different at the end of it
3032523 blows entire focus is on making sure that after youve played this game fundamentally you are a better person than before you played it
3032524 that tends to make people really uncomfortable thats not how we like thinking about games we spend a lot of time saying oh were just fun were just entertainment we dont have to have a bigger agenda
3032525 i think thats not a good enough answer i think if youre going to take hours and hours of somebodys life you need to know why you need to know why theyre going to be happier or wiser or smarter or more relaxed or fitter or cleverer or whatever it is at the end of it
3032526 i do think if you havent got an answer to that to why your game is going to enrich somebodys life i dont think youre necessarily a bad game designer but i think you might be a bad person
3032527 far cry 2 is a game with a message it has some stuff to say about the human condition
3032528 admittedly it expresses those thoughts about the human condition through taping grenades to fuel tanks and then shooting them from a distance but it still has things to say
3032529 theyve taken those underlying premises and messages and used them both to inform and constrain the story and the very fundamental game mechanics in a way that has simplified enriched and crystallised what theyre doing
3032530 we need to embrace the idea that our games should have some weight behind them some meat on their bones and something theyre trying to communicate if we want them to matter to people
3032531 its without question the most inept ugly stupid boorish pointless noisy ridiculous waste of time
3032532 i recommend the minute you get out of here you get on the internet and

3032549 no firm has all of the openings in your area that you may be a match for so applying to several firms is not a bad idea

3032567 the kardashian show is not about an eccentric family living conventionally it is purely about some desperate women climbing to the margins of fame and that feels a lot creepier
3032568 i would hate to see our teachers and classrooms lose out on money because the state doesnt have enough revenue
3032569 i understand why legislators want to give people a break because the economy is down and people are hurting and cant afford the things they want to buy
3032570 but they arent taking into account what that revenue could later buy for the states
3032571 weve given them the benefit of the doubt for a long time
3032572 a sales tax free weekend will be welcomed more than ever in this tough economy especially with the high prices of food and fuel
3032573 it is certainly worth it when you consider the positive impact on retail sales and consumer confidence
3032574 theres just something about a sales tax holiday thats different from a regular sale
3032575 there are a lot of families out there struggling to make ends meet and theyre having to stretch their dollars
3032576 while the 5 percent or so savings doesnt sound like a lot that could be a make or break

3032588 i would have thought he should have been aware of it before but im glad hes aware of the problem now and will try to address it
3032589 the gateway building is owned and operated by a separate entity the gateway association
3032590 im sure the gateway association and tourism corporation can form a strong partnership where they will approach government for the same funding for the two organizations
3032591 we came to a conclusion that the tourism corporation wont be able to run on its own so if we partner with the gateway and put together a new proposal that we feel will work for the best interests of both organizations we can then approach the different levels of government to fund it
3032592 the two organizations are used to working together and a closer more viable relationship would benefit everyone involved it forms a continuity amongst two organizations that can work closely together and still meet the mandate of both organizations
3032593 my wife and i thought it would be a great learning experience for our three sons
3032594 we are currently looking at a couple of american style schools in the area it will be an incredible life experience for all of us
3032595 it struck me that lots of wars particularly in the middle east are supported by the pursuit of making money
3032596 quite often the control of imported consumer goods is monopolized by small political factions making it tough to get the goods out in the hands of the general population there are many tragic trading parallels in middle eastern civil war particularly in lebanon between 1975 and 1989 and in algeria during the 1990s
3032597 the uae is the business hub of the gulf region and is an area with a great variety of people and cultures for me to tap into
3032598 less than 10 percent of dubais residents are uae citizens
3032599 the rest of the population is made up of expatriates from many countries sharing the united states cultural and political views of the middle east with a group this diverse should quite interesting
3032600 we check our chlorine residuals daily and if our residuals are good that means you cant have any harmful little bugs in the water system
3032601 we have the same type of system as lab city basically we chlorinate out of the pump house and check our residuals throughout the system
3032602 were required to have a chlorine residual throughout our system so we just keep checking it and make sure we do have one were supplying drinking water to 2 000 people so we have to make sure the quality is there
3032603 coliforms can show up due to heavy rainfall increased coliform loading in the lake or an upset in the system which we had when a water main broke in the trailer court a week before the advisory
3032604 weve also been flushing our water mains so an enormous amount of water like that can stir the whole system up
3032605 they werent getting enough revenue from it and its a shame to see a building that has provided so much to the town fall down on upkeep we did see this as a business opportunity where we could provide much needed housing in this community
3032606 i think people realize the building is getting run down and has become a haven for young people weve had problems with vandalism there and people feel like this will improve the value of the property in the area
3032607 its like a landmark in the town so many people have memories of going to school there and graduating
3032608 i think it would be nice to leave some characteristics of those days there we plan to do a lot of work there and it will be landscaped to fit and blend in with the neighbourhood
3032609 the rent will be fairly high for a while but we really dont know yet how much
3032610 one thing about rent like most things in life in the world we live in is that its based on supply and demand the 80 units will create quite a supply no matter who lives in them the price will be based on demand now i do think there is going to be a fairly strong demand for housing here over the next five or six years and i dont think thats a secret to anyone
3032611 government has a program available for subsidized housing that we have entertained
3032612 we have considered that for another apartment facility we own we already have 50 apartments so we are hoping that maybe we can make use of that type of program
3032613 we have been talking to the tenants from the church and are trying to work with them on relocating
3032614 naturally the people who were housed there were a bit disappointed and they recognized theyd have to move but they also recognized there is a need in the community and that is what we are providing
3032615 of course we see it as it as an opportunity but its also exciting to do new things its a good feeling when you are accomplishing something and its a shame to see a building that provided so much to a town go to the wayside
3032616 its centrally located and close to shopping schools the playground churches and there is a need for housing
3032617 like other developments we have done so far iga and the liquor store i mean you could drop these down in the middle of montreal or st johns and theyd blend right in and we will have those apartments the same there is no reason we cant have housing available here like they have in other cities
3032618 weve been waiting for quite a while on whether the site we have chosen near the fermont border would get the go ahead on natural attenuation
3032619 it looks like thats not going to happen so in the interim we need to identify a temporary landfill site until the province finishes their pan labrador study
3032620 in the meantime we need to get prepared for the end of this calendar year
3032621 we visited the site of the former landfill on the fermont highway just opposite the road to the golf course with representatives from the department of environment and at first glance that would likely be the best place to put a temporary landfill
3032622 whatever we can do were going to try to do
3032623 its a fair bit of work were anxious to have some kind of final decision so we can move forward on establishing a permanent landfill cause theres a lot of work to be done once a final decision is made

3032629 law enforcement operations like this should reassure the public that ice is committed to putting public safety first every individual targeted as part of this operation has a criminal record
3032630 criminal aliens should be on notice that ice is working closely with local law enforcement to take off the streets those who threaten the very safety of our neighborhoods
3032631 we appreciate the efforts of immigration and customs enforcement in its efforts to remove illegal individuals with extensive criminal records from our community
3032632 indicative of the ability of the agencies to work cooperatively together to achieve a common goal of public safety in our community
3032633 i would like to commend and thank all the law enforcement agencies on the local state and federal level who participated in this effort gang related activities and those who choose to partake in them do so knowing full well the negative impact their actions can have on the neighborhoods throughout our fine city we hope this weeks arrests will call attention to our never ending commitment to combat suppress and prevent future gang related behavior

3032650 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade

3032669 for now the europeans should stick to their role as mediator
3032670 they have already stated that their relations with russia could be affected by the conflict in georgia the eu cannot go further at the moment because it is too early to say that its mediation has failed and that alternative options must be reviewed they must still go to moscow and try to convince the russians
3032671 the emergency meeting of the eu foreign ministers on wednesday will be another chance for the europeans to show their unity
3032672 if the eu presents a united front it could be an asset in dealing with russia
3032673 it would be good to have a unified eu position on mediation
3032674 for the moment this seems to be the case the european countries share the priorities recognition of georgias territorial integrity an immediate ceasefire the withdrawal of troops and a return to the status quo
3032675 what we saw recently with the germans proposed peace deal for abkhazia was that the german mediation was accepted by all the parties and that the russians did not brush aside the draft text
3032676 although this proposal did not answer all their requirements it could at least be discussed that is a positive precedent for germany
3032677 the stabilization force is in principle a viable option in the medium term and one which is being discussed at eu level at the moment
3032678 it would however require an internationalization of the situation with member states having to agree to the use of troops as a buffer in the region this is very difficult to conceive as many states have differing relations with russia and also security within the eu is still a much debated issue
3032679 the eu could threaten to pull out of the negotiations with russia over the new partnership cooperation agreement while georgia could be threatened with a rejection of its proposed nato membership
3032680 both are of course very problematic and difficult as the eu actually wants a new partnership with russia and the rejection of the nato membership is what russia has been pushing for

3032694 this report highlights how peoples civil liberties are safer in scotland particularly after the scottish parliament voted to oppose id cards just last month

3032700 mr sabirs lawyer tayab ali of mccormacks solicitors in london told
3032701 the two members of the university were treated as though they were part of an al qaeda cell they were detained for 48 hours and a warrant for further detention was granted on the basis that the police had mobile phones and evidence taken from computers to justify this
3032702 a spokesman for nottingham confirmed that the police had been called after material was found on the computer used by a junior clerical member of staff

3032705 secondly dr greatrix university registrar claims that this was a low level investigation this claim however does not stand up to scrutiny students had their bags searched by uniformed police before entering the trent building the day after the arrests the student and member of staff that was arrested was held from wednesday may 14 until tuesday may 20 without charge in spite of the fact that rizwaan sabirs supervisor and personal tutor both confirmed to the police that the document they had downloaded and printed was legitimate research material on friday may 16 the homes of the two men were raided they had their computers impounded and they have still not been returned the family of rizwaan sabir was ejected from their home during the polices search several colleagues in the school of politics were interviewed for hours by the police a low key investigation would have resolved this matter within hours by contacting the relevant members of staff at the school of politics and international relations indeed a low key investigation to use dr greatrixs term would have been conducted by the university itself without any police involvement at all
3032706 during questioning the police regularly attempted to collate information about student activism and peaceful campaigning they asked numerous questions about the student peace magazine ceasefire and other political student activities the overt police presence on campus combined with increased and intimidating police presence at peaceful demonstrations has created a climate of fear amongst some students many saw the operation as a message from the police that they are likely to arrest those who have been engaged in peaceful political activities there is widespread concern in the community that the police are criminalising peaceful activists using terrorism legislation such as the prevention of terrorism act 2005

3032875 i love the idea of the back nine of a major on a sunday
3032876 i love it so much that im actually disappointed im seven months away from the next major and i dont know what im going to do
3032877 and definitely ive turned up at other events and unless i get into contention you know sometimes it feels like a race like a sprint whereas a major feels like a marathon
3032878 i feel like i can be patient and take my time and i love the feeling of knowing that its going to come down to the back nine its going to come down to who can do it under pressure in the last nine holes
3032879 that is an issue for me that i do have to play better when i feel confident about my game in a normal week when i have plenty of good performances
3032880 but the gap between the married and never married is closing especially for men
3032881 the times they are a changin marital status and health differentials from 1972 to 2003
3032882 politicians and scholars continue to debate the value of marriage for americans
3032883 with some going so far as to establish social programs and policies to encourage marriage among those socials groups less inclined to marry particularly the poor and minorities
3032884 encouraging marriage in order to promote health may be misguided

3032890 thats just thomas hes over nervous thomas should not be worrying about what im doing but he was worrying about everyone and everything and that to me is really the sole reason why he didnt perform
3032891 we were out of character tom was nervous and thats what happens certainly not so much for me im a little bit older than tom so i can take things on the chin a bit easier
3032892 when you are nervous you are in a different environment and things change and we both changed and did things differently

3032900 its particularly a moment where john mccain can claim to have been prescient
3032901 appears to have been ahead of the curve in his assessment that moscow was the bad actor here
3032902 its not just this part of the world but senator mccain has been to so many exotic places like waziristan and south ossetia and hes very comfortable with these issues he knows what he thinks
3032903 and its not just this part of the world but senator mccain has been to so many exotic places like waziristan and south ossetia and hes very comfortable with these issues he knows what he thinks hes been in contact with the leaders involved in these places for many many years so its really sort of a perfect thing for him and so the question is each time something like this pops up randomly we may see a cautiousness on the one hand by senator obama who has not been dealing with these things for years and maybe a little more aggressive voice from senator mccain and ill just tell you his favorite thing to say about vladimir putin is when i look into his eyes i see a k a g and a b hes been very very tough on putin for quite some time

3032911 i had seen his material and he was the best example of a dedicated working funny comic who made peoples lives that little bit better
3032912 just like little moments from the kings of comedy incorporating that into his show is probably the image im always going to have from him sitting in that chair and talking to america
3032913 the man was a genius i hope that at some point in my career that people think even half of me of what they thought of him
3032914 i was covering the swimming events when my photo editor telephoned me to say that president bush was expected to attend
3032915 when he arrived he almost fell down the stairs but was caught by his secret service agents but he seemed to be enjoying himself at the event having a good time and cheering the american team on and i think this picture captures that spirit

3032920 should coordinate with our partners in germany france and britain to seek an emergency meeting of the g 7 foreign ministers to discuss the current crisis
3032921 our united purpose should be to persuade the russian government to cease its attacks withdraw its troops and enter into negotiations with georgia
3032922 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world

3032954 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3032955 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3032956 its the ability to cast white as black and black as white which is surprising the ability to cast the aggressor as the victim and blame the victims for the consequences
3032957 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages

3032990 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
3032991 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
3032992 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

3032995 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
3032996 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

3033011 look this country is changing so much theres a lot of money here now a lot of business some of these beliefs arent going to survive
3033012 the common belief is that traditionalism dissolves in the solvents of modernity
3033013 we want to attach an economic sense to the culture
3033014 our stories grew around things that we could not explain
3033015 is an implicit sign of being too traditional or even backward

3033021 the next thing you know when we come out there are six or seven women swarming us asking all kinds of questions like
3033022 lakewoods history shows that they landlords have not discriminated look at how many orthodox are right now renting to non jews a huge percentage
3033023 the outcry in our community was not about renting to non jews it was about the impact on daily life from criminals and gangs
3033024 i have been after them for months to take a look at this they are in a unique position to hold these guys accountable when the rest of us cannot
3033025 this is not a witch hunt against the undocumented or any minority group
3033026 this action by the orthodox will definitely raise some eyebrows on discrimination
3033027 how can a landlord determine that a person is unsavory or undesirable unless they are referring to african americans or mexicans
3033028 its a wonderful idea but its expensive i dont know if its practical
3033029 it is time for us to go public against these destroyers of lakewood
3033030 i have heard many say that perhaps the landlords deserve time to work on and improve what they are doing
3033031 to just try and take on 10 000 units in one shot the system is doomed to failure
3033032 it will end up getting the good units while that few percent of bad units fall to the wayside
3033033 we had this all along so why didnt they come to support us then
3033034 but if they want to show it now id surely welcome that because lakewood really does need some help
3033035 id like to see it back before the end of the year

3033041 even the little that we were doing before has all been swept away
3033042 the list would not have been approved even if they submitted it because the minister would have said no
3033043 but they did not submit any list for youth programme they never thought of it so no one should blame the minister on this
3033044 the detection of a new avian influenza virus strain in africa raises serious concerns as it remains unknown how this strain has been introduced to the continent
3033045 it seems to be unlikely that wild birds have carried the strain to africa since the last migration of wild birds from europe and central asia to africa occurred in september 2007 and this years southerly migration into africa has not really started yet
3033046 it could well be that there are other channels for virus introduction international trade for example or illegal and unreported movement of poultry this increases the risk of avian influenza spread to other countries in western africa
3033047 uncertainty about virus spread and transmission is a major challenge for control campaigns increased surveillance is key to monitor the situation and keep track of virus spread
3033048 fao greatly appreciates nigerias swift reporting and sharing of the relevant information about this new virus strain
3033049 the government would issue a white paper on the report which will determine the actions it will take on the cbn and its governor

3033052 government should take appropriate action in respect of issues arising from prof soludos role in the formation funding and operation of the afc as we have identified in the main report some of these issues border on gross abuse of office gross negligence round tripping and money laundering

3033060 we had 100 plus sites and a big spreadsheet that was completed with all the different headings in different colours
3033061 it used to be a two week task to add up our commitment for the remaining term of leases for audit purposes
3033062 now it takes us about five minutes just because weve streamlined some of the reports
3033063 it was a huge windfall at the end of the financial year to be able to do that
3033064 ten or 15 minutes as opposed to three weeks was a gigantic improvement
3033065 previously they would ring us wed have to sit down with them roll out the sheets of paper and pull out the files

3033068 that type of data doesnt accumulate overnight it takes a bit of time to build up but going into next year were going to have two years worth of trend information they can make some decisions on
3033069 they could have done for us for an additional fee but we had resources here and we wanted to familiarise ourselves with the system
3033070 the only thing we had to do then was scan and attach key documents into the system
3033071 synetek could have done it for us but it chose to take it on here and it has done that really well
3033072 were very pleased with the technology and the opportunities with unwired well do it right not rushed
3033073 as we got larger we wanted to be able work smarter in how we delivered our pricing to the point of sale
3033074 one of the key drivers was that during our peak sales periods we have less experienced sales staff so we wanted to take decision making away from the staff and let the system take control
3033075 it was really at the point where it was not actually working had we not been able to improve it there would have been some hard decisions to be made
3033076 how to factsheets taking action to control pesticides and promote alternatives
3033077 virtualisation is all about how applications interface with the operating system this is one thing that microsoft agrees 100 per cent with us on
3033078 we are in a unique position because we are strong in virtualisation and we are strong in the operating system area with red hat enterprise linux
3033079 we and microsoft we are the only two vendors with all the pieces together for a full virtualisation system
3033080 many other vendors are putting hypervisors in the market by themselves without the operating system thats like having just a mousepad and no mouse theres not much you can do with it
3033081 it is kpmgs contention that in the next few years it professionals will be asked to work with the whole business to construct a sophisticated and robust set of measurement instrumentation and reporting tools for non financial data to track the flow of carbon through their business to the same level of detail that financial reporting tools do
3033082 a large number of it organisations are only giving sustainability cursory attention
3033083 at the moment there is way too much emphasis on getting our own house in order as it professionals with the emergence of these new tools will come the opportunity to seize leadership and engage with the whole business about how technology can be used to reduce the other 98 per cent of emissions that the it industry is not directly responsible for
3033084 its not enough to just green your data centre and apply virtualisation and think your job is done
3033085 it professionals have to step up to the plate and engage in a dialogue with the business to let them know technology has a role to improve the whole organisations environmental footprint
3033086 es gab keine alternative nachdem georgien angefangen hat mit dieser grausamen offensive auch mit raketenangriffen
3033087 bekurow in l ndern wie deutschland und frankreich scheinen sich die medien m he zu geben den konflikt zu verstehen und ausgewogen zu berichten das sagen auch meine kollegen aber vor allem ber cnn und auch ber die bbc bin ich schockiert da sind im bild ganz klar georgische kampfjets zu sehen im text wird von russischen gesprochen und wenn im bild ossetische tote sind spricht der reporter von georgischen opfern wenn ich das sehe f hle ich mich hilflos
3033088 heute de glauben sie nicht dass da jemand in den tv redaktionen im aktualit tsdruck die bilder falsch zugeordnet oder interpretiert haben k nnte bekurow nein so offensichtliche fehler kann man nicht machen das ist absicht die osseten haben in den augen der welt ffentlichkeit die falschen helfer und werden deshalb voreilig als separatisten abgestempelt aber meiner meinung nach ist es das erste mal in der modernen geschichte dass russland in den kaukasus nicht als angreifer kommt sondern um die menschen zu verteidigen ich sage es noch mal georgien hat angefangen mit den angriffen
3033089 ive had that all my career strikers are judged on goals ultimately

3033091 the phone was a disappointment from the standpoint that it couldnt maintain a consistent connection with the 3g network all the other features were fantastic
3033092 frankly if i knew it was going to be like this i wouldnt have paid the extra 10 a month
3033093 what were seeing is that the iphone 3g is performing very well
3033094 im not denying that people are having problems but we have to deal with these on a case by case basis
3033095 my belief is that because at amp ts network is not built out to every cell site people are getting frustrated because theyre finding places where the 3g signal isnt available or is weak
3033096 that doesnt mean you cant get a good experience on 1900mhz
3033097 typically the more you pack into a phone the tougher it is to build a really good one
3033098 sometimes customers may want to pin a problem on the device
3033099 or they want to pin it on the operator but really it doesnt matter how well they work separately they need to work together
3033100 i think the biggest disappointment was the service of both at amp t and apple i expected a lot more from both organizations
3033101 they should admit that there is an issue and that they are working through it
3033102 if you only have a hammer every problem is a nail
3033103 the credit crisis is providing an excellent reality check for financial organisations that have set up management information systems decision support systems data warehouses data marts and business intelligence systems that were at some point hailed as the key to reliable data aggregation and information mining
3033104 globally billions of it dollars have been spent on such systems in the banking sector yet these systems cannot calculate even the most basic figures needed to make sound business decisions in a timely manner
3033105 due to the lack of reliable and timely information traders and investors are forced to make decisions based on performance figures that are only visible through a smokescreen
3033106 product design details tend to be encrypted in software source code data quality is often not quantifiable and the low quality incomplete system integration introduces numerous manual steps that slow down the computation of performance figures

3033112 bandwidth is at least 30mbps so uploading videos wont be a problem we have catered for them to send and receive large files without problems
3033113 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3033114 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3033115 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3033116 a large part of efforts to force georgian authorities to peace in south ossetia
3033117 thats why we not only have to denounce this but we have to work to stop the fight
3033118 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3033119 if mama asks me to cook supper will you give me five dollars

3033122 average roundtrip cost of jet fuel todays prices is about 300 per passenger we would have to charge about 650 700 a passenger to break even
3033123 fares probably need to increase at this point another 15 20 percent before airlines cover their costs

3033139 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there
3033140 i knew i was going to have to swim out of my mind
3033141 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50
3033142 alain is wounded when you are the last swimmer in a relay and that you have the opportunity to bring a title of this importance to your country you dont get out of this unhurt
3033143 but i dont think that alain lost the race its lezak who won it
3033144 i knew i had to accelerate but it got harder
3033145 i saw katie and thought lets just try to catch her

3033147 ive just had a really off year on a really important year
3033148 i just feel like thats not the last youre going to see of me im going to bring it back and i wont be done until i at least have a legitimate shot at those world records again

3033171 the idea of anyone actually daring to criticise musicians for the sound they make is almost heresy everyone is treated equally which means no knocking anyone back however great the temptation thatll be why australian rock is best known to the outside world for such musical abominations as silverchair the vines and savage garden
3033172 its a really poor piece of journalism from a music writer who once had relevance and influence but now hes living in australia he doesnt really have the knowledge or experience of the local industry to back up his opinions
3033173 its just a shame he gets to hide under the masthead of the guardian which gives him credence where none is due

3033234 construction areas have been stripped of topsoil and checked for archaeological remains before being handed over to balfour beatty
3033235 in total weve checked and signed off a massive area of ground equivalent to about 20 football pitches

3033241 the interim results weve seen so far from this study have been very promising especially with the high degree of device lesion and procedural success
3033242 by the time we complete all the patient follow ups i expect the results to mirror the excellent clinical outcomes weve already seen in our hospital
3033243 this study shows that pro kinetic is the ideal stent for patients who do not necessarily require a drug eluting stent
3033244 with a late lumen loss of 0 65 mm these results rival some drug eluting stents we believe that the combination of our stent design thin strut thickness and the probio passive coating are responsible for such excellent outcomes and we look forward to confirming the results when the full 202 patient results come in

3033491 we havent announced anything for this type of cheap mini notebook and were still taking this wait and see attitude
3033492 the fact that there are a number of models coming out might give the indication that the market is growing and everybody wants to do this but whats interesting is you pull back the covers and talk to people in the industry and theyre kind of scared
3033493 if you cant grow the market with this form factor then what youre providing is a lower experience for less money which isnt good for the consumer and isnt good for the hardware maker and really isnt good for the channel as well
3033494 we believe the story line of ultra low cost notebooks will increasingly be sidelined as the notebook market continues to offer a better solution and experience at price points similar to what ultra low cost notebooks are hitting

3033559 poor people have been voting for democrats for the last 50 years and they are still poor
3033560 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
3033561 and the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory glory as of the only begotten from the father full of grace and truth
3033562 for this cause therefore the jews were seeking all the more to kill him because he not only was breaking the sabbath but also was calling god his own father making himself equal with god
3033563 i said therefore to you that you shall die in your sins for unless you believe that i am he you shall die in your sins
3033564 jesus said to them truly truly i say to you before abraham was born i am
3033565 and god said to moses i am who i am and he said thus you shall say to the sons of israel i am has sent me to you
3033566 i showed you many good works from the father for which of them are you stoning me
3033567 for a good work we do not stone you but for blasphemy and because you being a man make yourself out to be god
3033568 for in him all the fullness of deity dwells in bodily form
3033569 have this attitude in yourselves which was also in christ jesus 6who although he existed in the form of god did not regard equality with god a thing to be grasped 7but emptied himself taking the form of a bond servant and being made in the likeness of men 8and being found in appearance as a man he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death even death on a cross 9therefore also god highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name 10that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth 11and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father
3033570 thy throne o god is forever and ever a scepter of uprightness is the scepter of thy kingdom
3033571 you shall worship the lord your god and serve him only
3033572 where is he who has been born king of the jews for we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him
3033573 and they came into the house and saw the child with mary his mother and they fell down and worshiped him and opening their treasures they presented to him gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh
3033574 and those who were in the boat worshiped him saying
3033575 and behold jesus met them and greeted them and they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him
3033576 jesus heard that they had put him out and finding him he said
3033577 and who is he lord that i may believe in him
3033578 you have both seen him and he is the one who is talking with you
3033579 and when he again brings the first born into the world he says and let all the angels of god worship him
3033580 but being full of the holy spirit he gazed intently into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing at the right hand of god 56 and he said
3033581 paul called as an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and sosthenes our brother 2to the church of god which is at corinth to those who have been sanctified in christ jesus saints by calling with all who in every place call upon the name of our lord jesus christ their lord and ours
3033582 then you call on the name of your god and i will call on the name of the lord and the god who answers by fire he is god
3033583 and i will bring the third part through the fire refine them as silver is refined and test them as gold is tested
3033584 for whoever will call upon the name of the lord will be saved
3033585 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be delivered for in mount zion and in jerusalem shall be deliverance as the lord hath said and in the remnant whom the lord shall call
3033586 thus says the lord the king of israel and his redeemer the lord of hosts i am the first and i am the last and there is no god besides me
3033587 wonder whether this could anything to do with the price of diesel
3033588 the provision of desktop computers is one of the areas under consideration as part of sir peters independent review of the australian governments use and management of ict
3033589 typically agencies replace their computer workstations on a rolling three to four year time scale
3033590 in selecting a product agencies abide by the australian government procurement guidelines and will consider a range of value characteristics including price support and efficiency
3033591 an interdepartmental committee has been established to identify opportunities for government to lead by example and reduce greenhouse gas emissions waste energy and water use in government operations
3033592 this includes opportunities to reduce energy use in government buildings including energy use in lighting air conditioning and heating computers and other electrical equipment
3033593 their recommendations will be considered by government and the committee will also oversee the implementation of election commitments
3033594 the environmental purchasing guide and the green office guide produced by the department of the environment water heritage and the arts assist agencies in this regard
3033595 many agencies have instituted environmentally friendly policies for paper usage and recycling toner cartridge recycling and computer equipment disposal
3033596 many agencies with offices around australia have invested in videoconferencing facilities providing an alternative to air travel
3033597 it fails to achieve the right balance between the competing policy interests in this area
3033598 the real risk arising from the implementation of data breach legislation is to trivialise notification obligations in the mind of consumers to such an extent that they become meaningless and ineffective in terms of real data protection
3033599 in fact the potential damage to consumers of a blanket notification obligation could be twofold on the one hand it can create unjustified anxieties and on the other hand it may result in a lack of proper attention to more serious incidents for example if consumers come to regard numerous less serious data breach notification emails as a form of spam
3033600 this could include where an agencys internal processes have dealt appropriately with the person or system responsible for the disclosure and the individual to which the personal information relates has not been affected by that disclosure
3033601 it appears the banks debt will not be paid from the sale of the assets
3033602 the banks will suffer a substantial deficiency and therefore theres no chance of creditors getting a dividend hence shareholders will not have any likelihood of a return
3033603 working in a market like china is very challenging from a cultural perspective there was a lot of uncertainty about this 3g technology and as it was vendor agnostic we were required to train hundreds of people in its use
3033604 china has now proven it can deliver technological breakthroughs on the world stage although perhaps not a breakthrough technology td scdma will underpin the framework for 4g mobile technologies in the future
3033605 chinas censorship firewall wasnt an issue as it sits outside the carriers control
3033606 the political bureaucracy on the other hand was not so easy to navigate
3033607 but by the same token the chinese government owns all the operators there so its not like in australia where you will see carriers go head to head with the government on all manner of arguments
3033608 dinero quiero tener mucho dinero para gastarlo en lo que quiero
3033609 its very important for the government and the regulator to maintain the impetus towards competition and not to allow the nbn to be the sole supplier of infrastructure in competitive areas
3033610 its a peculiarly australian phenomenon for the cable operator to rely so heavily on competitors assets even in areas where it has its own network
3033611 its a mistake to allow optus to unbundle telstras local loop in the footprint of its hfc network it removes an opportunity to maximise infrastructure competition between the two networks
3033612 if you get infrastructure competitors to invest in infrastructure you get product differentiation and essentially you get an investment race
3033613 its fair to say from the optus perspective that telstra is pretty adept at twisting the facts
3033614 the problem in australia is that there was insufficient policy to properly govern telstras hfc rollout telstra was allowed to overbuild the optus hfc network and was allowed to take a dominant position in pay tv
3033615 those two factors destroyed the viability of optuss rollout because we didnt have the key point of differentiation
3033616 they essentially had a head start in the investment race
3033617 we will find over time that australia will have one ubiquitous broadband network with limited infrastructure based competition
3033618 vuelvete a mexico y yo te buscare un lindo chico
3033619 ahh a lo mejor yo tengo un amigo que esta solo y necesita novia te lo presento
3033620 its making sure our support areas such as it are sitting in one area accountable to one part of the business and they can support what our business needs particularly when were moving into such a large program of work
3033621 you want your key areas under the control of one person to make sure theyre working as effectively as possible
3033622 each system has been assessed for current and future requirements including operating cost components
3033623 the strategy takes account of like for like replacement for those applications that have ongoing use and scopes new initiatives that are planned for the 2009 14 period
3033624 will be a critical component of energy australias it infrastructure for the next generation of it systems and will improve data security in line with modern standards
3033625 obviously the job advertisements are down but it still hasnt deteriorated significantly
3033626 the reason for that is employers still know they have to keep good talent for when it the market bounces back
3033627 i dont think that there is going to be mass retrenchments but there will be very limited hiring and the same thing applies to contractors
3033628 this is probably the first sign we have seen of the new media softening
3033629 although there are things making their way through the system such as tax cuts and oil pricing not getting any worse i still think the global financial jitters will continue to hurt all australian employers
3033630 the trend is still down and there are no obvious signs of recovery
3033631 with the new financial year now in swing this could be worrying signs for the it market in australia
3033632 however it could also point to differing methods of recruitment and less reliance by organisations on traditional internet job boards for finding people
3033633 this could be the only sector said to be affected by the
3033634 capital works programs can only begin in july with the new budgets and that includes the it specialists required to run the programs
3033635 the july increase was not so significant when viewed over the quarter and compared month on month
3033636 these results are going to be less about 2008 and more about 2009 and 2010
3033637 we will see how the timetable of the it transformation is going and how many customers have been moved on to the new system

3033642 implies that the decline is being driven by the faster disappearance of the remaining largest individuals a result consistent with hypothesis that an anthropogenic source of mortality is driving the decline
3033643 our avdat 4x tm 20 gbps drop in optical connector is thoroughly tested at various data speeds of up to 5 gbps per channel previous ber testing equipment was bulky costly and required the use of nearly our entire production lab
3033644 alteras stratix ii gx fpga development board has a much lower cost in absolute terms and requires less lab space and power which greatly helps our cost effectiveness by the end of this year our plans are to have 10 to 15 stratix ii gx fpga boards set up with an expected savings of more than one million dollars in equipment and energy costs and a savings of more than 400 square feet of lab space
3033645 xlooms innovative use of our stratix ii gx development kit is yet another example of how companies are applying our fpga products to cost effectively address the difficult challenges they face
3033646 we are pleased to be able to help xloom and other industry pioneers bring innovations to their space and succeed in their markets

3033663 we are pleased to help forge this new alliance between standard chartered bank nigeria and lapo which will help to fuel lapos expansion into southwest and eastern nigeria thus giving more poor nigerians access to financial services and financial security
3033664 this is the largest portfolio financing support lapo has received so far from a commercial bank it has great implications for our efforts to reach a large number of female owners of microenterprises across the country
3033665 the grameen foundation standard chartered bank nigeria lapo financing is a bold statement on the institutional strength of lapo as well as in the enormous potential of the nascent nigerian microfinance sector
3033666 the bank focuses on activities that not only enhance our business performance now and for the long term but also enhance the economic development of the countries we operate in have a positive impact on the environment and society as well as contribute to good governance i am quite proud of this tripartite partnership with grameen foundation and lapo which has given us the opportunity to provide major support for nigerias microfinance sector

3033673 this moment could well mark the end of an era in europe during which realpolitik and spheres of influence were supposed to be replaced by new cooperative norms and a countrys right to choose its own path
3033674 to counter russian pressure on its neighbors especially ukraine most likely the next target in moscows efforts to create a new sphere of hegemony
3033675 russias attack on sovereign georgian territory marked the official return of history indeed to an almost 19th century style of great power competition complete with virulent nationalisms battles for resources struggles over spheres of influence and territory and even though it shocks our 21st century sensibilities the use of military power to obtain geopolitical objectives

3033679 promptly arresting the head of the gang and exposing the lies and manipulation of public sentiment by the state governor who had blamed the shooting on his political opponents
3033680 it is now clear that governor theodore orji not for the first time spoke first before getting his facts right his comments then blaming the shooting on the opposition were meant to procure public sympathy for a dying regime now the facts are out and the chickens have come home to roost
3033681 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3033682 i consider your visit to inquire about the bakassi situation as very unnecessary in other areas your committee would not have attempted this visit now
3033683 icj gave its judgment on october 12 2002 obasanjo signed the treaty ceding the area on the 12 2006 two events that did not get the reaction of the senate inspite of the outcry by helpless bakassi people who were ordered to shut up by their leader in the presidency
3033684 on august 26 2004 i wrote two letters to kofi annan and prof ibrahim gambari and copied the senate on june 13 2006 a day after i heard about the green tree agreement i wrote another letter to all nigerians and the national assembly apart from major conferences since 2002 in all these the senate kept mute senators even said obasanjo was right in signing the treaty the senate failed to rise to the occasion when it mattered most it was only the house of representatives through hon essien ayi that rose to the occasion with a motion unanimously passed by the house against the ceding
3033685 they went to archibong town and lowered the nigerian flag handing over northern bakassi to cameroun i was not there because i was very emotional about it i did not want to go and see my area being taken away when they will be going to abana if they will i will not be there to see it it is like a father going to the burial of his son and watching as his son is about to be lowered down it is an abomination the man may collapse
3033686 the government both at the national and state levels has refused to talk to bakassi people we know that there was a judgment in 2002 and we knew since then that the judgment has no appeal and the nigerian nation and the united nations knew that sovereignty had been given to cameroun and eventually bakassi people will leave nobody made any arrangement since then on the issue of resettlement of bakassi people few days to handing over as has been reported nobody has talked to the paramount ruler of the place
3033687 the challenges are the usual challenges you meet in the course of an emergency situation while trying to take care of human beings providing shelter water sanitation food and clothing
3033688 we are expecting government to come and find a solution to our problems so that we may be back to our villages
3033689 most of us here are from different states some of us are from rivers while some are from bayelsa akwa ibom and cross river we are still expecting more help from government so that we can be back to our homes i was born in 1972 and my father took me to mbomo village in old bakassi and my father lived there before he died

3033694 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3033695 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3033696 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3033697 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3033698 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3033699 this isnt just a career for me its my passion

3033705 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3033706 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3033707 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3033731 by no means do we think we have made it
3033732 we will definitely have a 10 team competition in 2009 and were confident the two new teams will ultimately be more successful on and off the field because of the longer lead in time weve heard the talk but i think everyone gets a little nervous on the eve of a new season thats just natural everything points to another successful season
3033733 if i put on my optimistic view which i have to do in this job maybe we will end up with 14 teams and it would be wonderful if the new teams are also strong everything is heading in the right direction the crowds are growing the television audience is growing membership is growing the media coverage as well and the game is reasonably financially sound now what we have to do is make sure the clubs also become sound there is a lot more to do and we have some important and ambitious long term goals for the a league
3033734 were very happy its a substantially better deal and it proves the corporate interest is very strong
3033735 if the price is right we wont stand in his way but as it stands all we have is an approach from an agent who refuses to name the interested club

3033739 a 25 basis points is fully priced in for september but what the market is grappling with is whether they go 25 or 50 basis points
3033740 we think a 25 basis point rate cut is more realistic the rba has emphasised how important it is growth to be weaker over a sustained period of time
3033741 the rba does not want to kickstart the economy they just want to temper some of the tight conditions that have been coming through from monetary policy
3033742 we think the market is overpriced with three rate cuts this year we expect to see two over the next couple of months and that will give them some breathing space
3033743 i was getting my suit zipped up and it broke and i had to do a quick change and the lzrs arent the easiest thing to get into
3033744 i was a bit stressed out libby was a great help in mentally settling me down
3033745 i had a suit malfunction before the semi finals and jess did the same for me then
3033746 but jesss situation was a little bit harder to deal with so close to the final she did an amazing job to re focus and get in there and fight the whole way
3033747 calmed her down a little bit its really emotional when something like that happens before a big race
3033748 before the race i felt like i was going to vomit
3033749 but then this amazing sense of calm came over me and i knew that more than anything i wanted to walk away with no regrets
3033750 she nailed the start even with the crowd and once i saw the first few strokes and she set it up really well i felt very confident
3033751 thats all you can ask to come in and swim a pb personal best in the olympic final is more than i could have hoped for its blown me away
3033752 i have now equalled what i did in athens but its switched around she won gold in the 4x100m freestyle relay and bronze in the 50m freestyle in 2004 anything from now on is a bonus
3033753 jess has pushed me all the way from the beginning i would not be here without her
3033754 were about to enter our 19th consecutive year of truman envy ever since the berlin wall fell people have looked at the way harry truman george c marshall dean acheson and others created forward looking global institutions after world war ii and theyve asked why cant we rally that kind of international cooperation to confront terrorism global warming nuclear proliferation and the rest of todays problems the answer is that in the late 1940s global power was concentrated the victory over fascism meant the mantle of global leadership rested firmly on the atlantic alliance the united states accounted for roughly half of world economic output within the u s power was wielded by a small bipartisan permanent governing class men like acheson w averell harriman john mccloy and robert lovett
3033755 power was wielded by a small bipartisan permanent governing class
3033756 today power is dispersed there is no permanent bipartisan governing class in washington globally power has gone multipolar with the rise of china india brazil and the rest this dispersion should in theory be a good thing but in practice multipolarity means that more groups have effective veto power over collective action in practice this new pluralistic world has given rise to globosclerosis an inability to solve problem after problem
3033757 the doha failure comes amid a decade of globosclerosis the world has failed to effectively end genocide in darfur chinese and russian vetoes foiled efforts to impose sanctions on zimbabwe the world has failed to implement effective measures to deter irans nuclear ambitions the world has failed to embrace a collective approach to global warming europes drive toward political union has stalled in each case the logic is the same groups with a strong narrow interest are able to block larger groups with a diffuse but generalized interest the narrow chinese interest in sudanese oil blocks the worlds general interest in preventing genocide irans narrow interest in nuclear weapons trumps the worlds general interest in preventing a middle east arms race diplomacy goes asymmetric and the small defeat the large
3033758 in a multipolar world there is no way to referee disagreements among competing factions in a democratic nation the majority rules and members of the minority understand that they must accede to the wishes of those who win elections but globally people have no sense of shared citizenship everybody feels they have the right to say no and in a multipolar world many people have the power to do so there is no mechanism to wield authority there are few shared values on which to base a mechanism the autocrats of the world dont even want a mechanism because they are afraid that it would be used to interfere with their autocracy the results are familiar we get united nations resolutions that go unenforced we get high minded vows to police rogue regimes but little is done we get the failure of the doha round and the gradual weakening of the international economic order
3033759 globosclerosis continues and people around the world lose faith in their leaders its worth remembering that george w bush is actually more popular than many of his peers his approval ratings hover around 29 percent gordon browns are about 17 percent japans yasuo fukudas are about 26 percent nicolas sarkozy angela merkel and silvio berlusconi have ratings that are a bit higher but still pathetically low this is happening because voters rightly sense that leaders lack the authority to address problems the bottom line is that presidential candidates can talk grandly about global partnerships but its meaningless without a mechanism to wield authority a crucial question in an authority crisis is who has a strategy for execution the best idea floating around now is a league of democracies as john mccain and several democrats have proposed nations with similar forms of government do seem to share cohering values if democracies could concentrate authority in such a league at least part of the world would have a mechanism for wielding authority it may not be a return to acheson marshall and the rest but at least it slows the relentless slide towards drift and dissipation
3033760 it will be the toughest race ever as there will be many challenges the contestants will not expect and be mentally prepared for the teams will have shorter resting time the journey will be harder and the speed of the race will be faster and more intense this combined with the new cast you can expect many dramatic moments tears twists and turns and an overall thrilling ride for viewers
3033761 the amazing race asia is a mega production and we have only been able to create this world world class production because of the faith of our valuable partners many like sony electronics asia pacific caltex nokia and standard chartered bank are long time supporters of asian franchise and we are proud to bring in our new partners singha corporation and maskargo to the race

3033783 ive spotted an excellent opportunity to cash in on the turnaround of one of americas most visible companies starbucks
3033784 ive had my eye on a number of retail stocks for some time now looking for signs of a potential turnaround and starbucks is now high on my list
3033785 one of the main reasons for the slide in sbux shares from its high of 40 in november 2006 was the overly aggressive expansion plan
3033786 and as food and dairy prices have soared this has led to higher operating costs in turn this forced starbucks to raise prices just as consumers were struggling from the housing slump and soaring inflation
3033787 and as competition from the likes of mcdonalds and dunkin donuts has turned up the heat starbucks has suffered charges related to closing out unprofitable stores but starbucks is tackling the problems
3033788 declining sales along with its falling stock price has hit starbucks like a double shot of espresso at 7 00 am so the firm has gone back to basics launching its revival from the top
3033789 starbucks has re hired the man responsible for the companys success ceo howard schultz having served as ceo from 1987 to 2000 schultz helped starbucks grow from 100 coffee shops to 15 756 stores today
3033790 his knowledge and experience should help greatly in turning starbucks around he wants to return to the companys roots the coffee the consumer and the starbucks experience more specifically schultz plans to reform starbucks in the following ways
3033791 i like what i hear about starbucks transformation but in the current environment the key to boosting business is pricing people are willing to pay for the starbucks experience as long as the price is within reason
3033792 schultzs strategy of soft pedaling growth in mature markets while investing more heavily overseas reminds me of the mcdonalds plan in the early 2000s it worked too its share price has more than quadrupled since 2003
3033793 and schultzs return has attracted some much bigger customers too
3033794 typically he pressures companies to focus on their core businesses and dump less profitable ventures he will reinforce starbucks raison detre a coffee house do coffee and do it well and people will return
3033795 the return of schultz and his rebuilding plan along with investments by peltz and ainslie has had a positive effect on sbux shares over the last month

3033801 considering what is known about past species changes in inwood park and other new york city parks the new york city parks department natural resources group ecological restoration efforts would benefit from structured scientific research on plantings survival through partnerships with scientists who have studied the ecology of new york city parks
3033802 todays plantings for the ecological restoration of inwood park are similar to private estate plantings done following the american revolution period which have been decimated by subsequent use and management of the land

3033985 it has become extraordinarily difficult to write libraries that run as fast as possible
3033986 particularly affected are numerical applications those that require extensive mathematics such as any form of audio image video processing communication medical imaging scientific modeling and many others
3033987 puts performance optimization into the realm of guru programmers who do things like restructure the computation to avoid cache misses use special vector instructions and parallelize for multiple processor cores
3033988 this may mark the first time that commercial library development is done by a computer
3033989 the key idea behind spiral is a novel framework that combines several techniques including the use of mathematical domain specific languages and rewriting to raise the level of abstraction and teach spiral algorithm knowledge and algorithm optimization
3033990 when spiral writes software different available algorithms are considered and evaluated and undergo sophisticated optimizations so the final code is not only correct but also runs as fast as possible and it does sometimes beating all competitors
3033991 spiral can to date only implement a limited set of functionality but one has to start somewhere and we believe that spirals approach can be carried much further approaches like spiral may be crucial in dealing with future computing platforms

3033998 the iocs decision to bring its congress here is affirmation of our capacity to host the most high profile and significant of the worlds conferences meetings and exhibitions this is a reputation that south africa has been working hard to build since it successfully hosted the world summit on sustainable development in 2002 and that won it the right to host the 2010 fifa world cup

3034046 we expressed a desire to see the program not solely on campus but available to the whole community
3034047 we also wanted a more equitable investment in and benefit from the revenues it seemed as if the only alternative if we wanted car sharing in ithaca was to build it ourselves
3034048 it captured peoples imagination about what was possible people were talking about it and it became a much more common idea
3034049 there was a call for it in the ithaca community
3034050 we are helping ithaca by lowering the amount of cars using the roads and adding to our infrastructures wear and tear
3034051 for areas with dense parking we hope to have our cars available since for every carshare vehicle about 15 others come off the road which makes it easier for others to find parking as well

3034059 all three of them have different philosophies on different things its almost been like this is a laboratory for me to go watch and see these guys work their stuff ive taken great notes mental notes its been great for me and i know itll make me a better coach
3034060 coach mckillop has done a terrific job stressing that all these guys are going to play as a team
3034061 all these guys are terrific high school basketball players and theyre going to be terrific college players team usa needs guys who are going to sacrifice maybe points and give themselves up on defense and the little things in the game

3034067 as a coach i feel good about the way ive been doing things because its similar in the way the other coaches look at things so it almost gives me the reinforcement that they are asking for the same things

3034091 das ist zun chst erstmal eine entscheidung der hessischen freundinnen und freunde wir sind bereit beratend und mit berlegungen zur seite zu stehen alles andere was an ffentlichen ratschl gen gegeben wird ist nicht ganz hilfreich

3034327 hello my name is anna and im a gameophobic its been six weeks since my last yahtzee
3034328 am i a good singer really mom tell me the truth
3034329 i dont understand it my mother always said i was a great singer
3034330 sweetie you have lots of talents you are a talented writer youre a talented soccer player i just dont know that singing is your best talent
3034331 im going to be an actress when i grow up
3034332 hi my name is luis suarez google me 1 on the list of results
3034333 we only get one life but if you work it just right one is all you will ever need
3034334 i consider it a box for all of our memories of beijing
3034335 our names are on it our numbers on the top of the box is where your jersey would lay and hopefully your medal
3034336 im supposed to get an autographed team jersey for these things
3034337 when you tell people you make awards for a living they think you are in your garage with a little table saw
3034338 theyre not making it any better they are just making it cheaper
3034339 if someone wants 12 000 pieces and they want to wait five months they go to china
3034340 if they want 1 500 pieces and they need it immediately they come to us
3034341 i dont think an american basketball team would approve of a uniform in a box made in china
3034342 will all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years
3034343 hes been able but undistinguished i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done
3034344 kaine was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
3034345 and again with all due respect to richmond virginia its smaller than chula vista california aurora colorado mesa or gilbert arizona north las vegas or henderson nevada its not a big town
3034346 im not running for anything so im not going to make a case
3034347 my sense is it shows somebody who doesnt know anything about virginia
3034348 theyre tired of a federal government that cant respond to a hurricane like katrina cant figure out what the rationale to go to war is cant manage a war people care about management so rove either doesnt know about virginia or he doesnt care about management
3034349 wont that bolster john mccains argument that the presidency needs someone with experience dealing with issues like these
3034350 i think the two concerns that americans have are the state of our economy and our security at home and abroad
3034351 and this issue in georgia obviously raises great questions but i think as we look at security what americans want is judgment experience is only positive insofar as it creates good judgment
3034352 it was funny but wearing a clown suit and juggling would be funny too
3034353 but it doesnt connect with the concerns americans have about gas prices about the war about the economy i hope the mccain camp does more of those ads
3034354 hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia
3034355 der hauptgrund f r meine r ckkehr ist dass ich dem verein helfen will ich will aber auch spielen
3034356 i hope someone out there will come forward to help put my mums killer away and to let her rest in peace and to allow myself and my family to continue life the best we can
3034357 my mum was a lovely woman who would not hurt a fly she was friendly and would talk to anyone who would talk to her
3034358 there is no known reason why someone would do what they did
3034359 i hope that because of advances in science and technology her killer can be found
3034360 because of the rising prices of food and gas more families are just struggling with the basics and the necessities
3034361 weve had people having to choose between milk and medical bills school supplies really get bumped
3034362 any and all school supplies the most basic things notebooks paper pens backpacks would be wonderful all the essentials
3034363 a lot of our families are struggling with food prices going up and gas prices going up
3034364 i was just looking now at the supply list and it does seem to be getting longer every year
3034365 weve always had it open to anyone if they have a need
3034366 we are really trying hard to address the needy children in the central virginia area were not just focusing on the lynchburg area our agency addresses the counties as well
3034367 we usually need backpacks i would love backpacks that takes a lot of our budget
3034368 the kids love it the families love it even more
3034369 the overall economy being what it is has really put an importance on community organizations
3034370 its always important to be able to do what we do but in lean times its magnified
3034371 we all took it for granted growing up that we had everything we need but a lot of kids dont
3034372 just wanted to let you know we put a couple clips from this present wasteland on our myspace page so when you get a chance stop by and take a listen if you click on the new banner it will take you directly to amazon to order the new cd we also received a video from a guitar camp that angus clark tso was a part of where he performed and discussed with the students the solo he did for the song monster on our new release angus was one of the guest soloists on this present wasteland we will see you thursday night in florida at bourbon street and then on saturday in puerto rico with queensr che

3034410 i cant explain how hard it is for us to leave our family but we feel that god has called us to do this and we feel so driven to go
3034411 desafortunadamente la comunidad mundial todav a est lejos de este objetivo
3034412 los gobiernos tienen una opci n clara pueden o bien continuar con las cosas como de costumbre lo que cuesta unas 1 000 muertes cada d a debido a la violencia de las armas o bien llegar a acuerdos legalmente vinculantes para restringir el comercio il cito

3034451 i felt i wasnt safe and that meant that my family wasnt safe
3034452 when i arrived here i went to the office of the un high commissioner for refugees unhcr and talked to them about my case but i had no proof that i had worked with the us army
3034453 a year later i lost the hope to start over things werent moving and i wondered what i could do
3034454 we dont have any statistics but we consider there are between 400 000 and 450 000 refugees from iraq here
3034455 jordans population of five million has grown by 750 000 with the arrival of the iraqi refugees
3034456 most refugees want to go home most dont want to go somewhere new and restart their lives
3034457 at this time most iraqis in jordan dont see a situation where they can return and some will never ever be able to go back

3034471 we took him from arsenal reserves and made him an international player
3034472 although we do accept from his point of view he has given us two years of excellent service and it wasnt his fault that we were relegated we feel its not the right time to sell him from the clubs point of view we hope in due course he realises we are being entirely reasonable
3034473 we have the highest respect for him that is why weve offered him a new contract doubling his money despite the fact that hes got two years left on his existing contract and we have a two year option at the end of his existing contract

3034504 americans wishing to spend august vacationing with their families or watching the olympics may wonder why their newspapers and television screens are filled with images of war in the small country of georgia
3034505 georgia is an ancient country at the crossroads of eastern europe and central asia and one of the worlds first nations to adopt christianity as an official religion
3034506 following fraudulent parliamentary elections in 2003 a peaceful democratic revolution took place led by the u
3034507 what the people of georgia have accomplished in terms of democratic governance a western orientation and domestic reform is nothing short of remarkable
3034508 in recent days moscow has sent its tanks and troops across the internationally recognized border into the georgian region of south ossetia
3034509 the implications of russian actions go beyond their threat to the territorial integrity and independence of a democratic georgia
3034510 yesterday georgia withdrew its troops from south ossetia and offered a ceasefire
3034511 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe it is time we moved forward with a number of steps
3034512 the united states and our allies should continue efforts to bring a resolution before the un security council condemning russian aggression noting the withdrawal of georgian troops from south ossetia and calling for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of russian troops from georgian territory
3034513 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia a partnership for peace nation
3034514 the secretary of state should begin high level diplomacy including visiting europe to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia
3034515 the u s should work with azerbaijan and turkey and other interested friends to develop plans to strengthen the security of the baku tbilisi ceyhan oil pipeline

3034519 having thought about this for thirty minutes i still think the guy would be one hell of a vp not to minimize the misstep but
3034520 georgia is an ancient country at the crossroads of eastern europe and central asia and one of the worlds first nations to adopt christianity as an official religion
3034521 we have other important strategic interests at stake in georgia especially the continued flow of oil through the baku tblisi ceyhan pipeline which russia attempted to bomb in recent days

3034532 and during the commercial breaks we saw plenty of those obama is the biggest celebrity in world tv ads hitting the presumptive democratic nominee but almost every other tv ad we saw whether it was from audi coke or the now foreign owned anheuser busch was positive and upbeat just asking are mccains ads tonally off for the olympics

3034619 the nineteenth century suffered from a curious division between its political ideas and its economic practice in politics it carried out the liberal ideas of locke and rousseau which were adapted to a society of small peasant proprietors its watchwords were liberty and equality but meantime it was inventing the technique which is leading the twentieth century to destroy liberty and to replace equality by new forms of oligarchy the prevalence of liberal thought has been in some ways a misfortune since it has prevented men of large vision from thinking out in an impersonal manner the problems raised by industrialism socialism and communism it is true are essentially industrial creeds but their outlook is so much dominated by the class war that they have little leisure to give to anything but the means of achieving political victory traditional morality gives very little help in the modern world a rich man may plunge millions into destitution by some act which not even the severest catholic confessor would consider sinful while he will need absolution for a trivial sexual aberration which at the worst has wasted an hour that might have been more usefully employed there is need of a new doctrine on the subject of my duty to my neighbour it is not only traditional religious teaching that fails to give adequate guidance on this subject but also the teaching of nineteenth century liberalism take for example such a book as mill on liberty mill maintains that while the state has a right to interfere with those of my actions that have serious consequences to others it should leave me free where the effects of my actions are mainly confined to myself such a principle however in the modern world leaves hardly any scope for individual freedom as society becomes more organic the effects of men upon each other become more and more numerous and important so that there remains hardly anything in regard to which mills defence of liberty is applicable take for example freedom of speech and of the press it is clear that a society that permits these is thereby precluded from various achievements which are possible to a society that forbids them in time of war this is obvious to everybody because in war time the national purpose is simple and the causation involved is obvious hitherto it has not been customary for a nation in peace time to have any national purpose except the preservation of its territory and its constitution a government which like that of soviet russia has a purpose in peace time as ardent and definite as that of other nations in war time is compelled to curtail freedom of speech and of the press as much while it is at peace as other nations do when they are at war the diminution of individual liberty which has been taking place during the last twenty years is likely to continue since it has two continuing causes on the one hand modern technique makes society more organic on the other hand modern sociology makes men more and more aware of the causal laws in virtue of which one mans acts are useful or harmful to another man if we are to justify any particular form of individual liberty in the scientific society of the future we shall have to do it on the ground that that form of liberty is for the good of society as a whole but not in most cases on the ground that the acts concerned affect nobody but the agent
3034620 the man who dreams of a scientifically organized world and wishes to translate his dream into practice finds himself faced with many obstacles there is the opposition of inertia and habit people wish to continue behaving as they always have behaved and living as they always have lived there is the opposition of vested interest an economic system inherited from feudal times gives advantages to men who have done nothing to deserve them and these men being rich and powerful are able to place formidable obstacles in the way of fundamental change in addition to these forces there are also hostile idealisms christian ethics is in certain fundamental respects opposed to the scientific ethic which is gradually growing up christianity emphasizes the importance of the individual soul and is not prepared to sanction the sacrifice of an innocent man for the sake of some ulterior good to the majority christianity in a word is unpolitical as is natural since it grew up among men devoid of political power the new ethic which is gradually growing in connexion with scientific technique will have its eye upon society rather than upon the individual it will have little use for the superstition of guilt and punishment but will be prepared to make individuals suffer for the public good without inventing reasons purporting to show that they deserve to suffer in this sense it will be ruthless and according to traditional ideas immoral but the change will have come about naturally through the habit of viewing society as a whole rather than as a collection of individuals we view a human body as a whole and if for example it is necessary to amputate a limb we do not consider it necessary to prove first that the limb is wicked we consider the good of the whole body a quite sufficient argument similarly the man who thinks of society as a whole will sacrifice a member of society for the good of the whole without much consideration for that individuals welfare this has always been the practice in war because war is a collective enterprise soldiers are exposed to the risk of death for the public good although no one suggests that they deserve death but men have not hitherto attached the same importance to social purposes other than war and have therefore shrunk from inflicting sacrifices which were felt to be unjust i think it probable that the scientific idealists of the future will be free from this scruple not only in time of war but in time of peace also in overcoming the difficulties of the opposition that they will encounter they will find themselves organized into an oligarchy of opinion such as is formed by the communist party in the u s s r
3034621 in suggesting any curtailment of liberty there are always two quite distinct questions to be considered the first is whether such a curtailment would be in the public interest if it were wisely carried out and the second is whether it will be in the public interest when it is carried out with a certain measure of ignorance and perversity these two questions are in theory quite distinct but from the point of view of the government the second question does not exist since every government believes itself entirely free from both ignorance and perversity every government consequently in so far as it is not restrained by traditional prejudices will advocate more interference with liberty than is wise when therefore as in this chapter we are considering what interferences with liberty might be theoretically justified we must hesitate to draw the conclusion that they should be advocated in practice i think it probable however that almost all interferences with liberty for which there is a theoretical justification will in time be carried out in practice because scientific technique is gradually making governments so strong that they need not consider outside opinion the result of this will be that governments will be able to interfere with individual liberty wherever in their opinion there is a sound reason for so doing and for the reason just given this will be much more often than it should be for this reason scientific technique is likely to lead to a governmental tyranny which may in time prove disastrous
3034622 let us take some examples of traditional principles which appear no longer defensible to take a more important illustration consider the immense sums of money that are spent on advertising it cannot possibly be maintained that these bring any but the most meagre return to the community the principle of permitting each capitalist to invest his money as he chooses is not therefore socially defensible
3034623 take again the question of work both the kind of work and the method of performing it at present young people choose their own trade or profession usually because at the moment of their choice it seems to afford a good opening a well informed person possessed of foresight might know that the particular line in question was going to be much less profitable a few years hence in such a case some public guidance to the young might prove extremely useful and as regards technical methods it is seldom in the public interest that an antiquated or wasteful technique should be allowed to persist when a more economical technique is known at present owning to the irrational character of the capitalist system the interest of the individual wage earner is very often opposed to the interest of the community since economical methods may cause him to lose his job this is due to the survival of capitalistic principles in a society which has grown so organic that it ought not to tolerate them it is obvious that in a well organized community it should be impossible for a large body of individuals to profit by preserving an inefficient technique it is clear that the use of the most efficient technique should be enforced and no wage earner should be allowed to suffer by its enforcement
3034624 i come now to a matter which touches the individual more intimately i mean the question of propagation it has hitherto been considered that any man and woman not within the prohibited degrees have a right to marry and having married have a right if not a duty to have as many children as nature may decree this is a right which the scientific society of the future is not likely to tolerate in any given state of industrial and agricultural technique there is an optimum density of population which ensures a greater degree of material well being than would result from either an increase or a diminution of numbers as a general rule except in new countries the density of population has been beyond this optimum though perhaps france in recent decades has been an exception except where there is property to be inherited the member of a small family suffers almost as much from over population as the member of a large family those who cause over population are therefore doing an injury not only to their own children but to the community it may therefore be assumed that society will discourage them if necessary as soon as religious prejudices no longer stand in the way of such action the same question will arise in a more dangerous form as between different nations and different races if a nation finds that it is losing military superiority through a lower birth rate than that of a rival it may attempt as has already been done in such cases to stimulate its own birth rate but when this proves ineffective as it probably will there will be a tendency to demand a limitation in the birth rate of the rival nation an international government if it ever comes into being will have to take account of such matters and just as there is at present a quota of national immigrants into the united states so in future there will be a quota of national immigrants into the world children in excess of the licensed figure will presumably be subjected to infanticide this would be less cruel than the present method which is to kill them by war or starvation i am however only prophesying a certain future not advocating it quality as well as quantity of population is likely to become a matter for public regulation already in many states of america it is permissible to sterilized the mentally defective and a similar proposal in england is in the domain of practical politics this is only the first step as time goes on we may expect a greater and greater percentage of the population to be regarded as mentally defective from the point of view of parenthood however that may be it is clear that the parents who have a child when there is every likelihood of its being mentally defective are doing a wrong both to the child and to the community no defensible principle of liberty therefore stands in the way of preventing them from such behaviour
3034625 equality like liberty is difficult to reconcile with scientific technique since this involves a great apparatus of experts and officials inspiring and controlling vast organizations
3034626 it allows its user to install mac os x straight from the original dvd without having to worry about patches replacing files and anything like that
3034627 given the sharp rally in local interest rate markets banks could cut mortgage rates today if they wanted

3034629 other banks will grow their profits despite difficult conditions globally
3034630 a key fact here is that the 90 day bank bill rate has fallen sharply over the past 10 days
3034631 i suspect the major banks will follow any initial 25 basis points rba cut with a 20 25 basis point cut in mortgage rates whereas a 50 basis point rba cut might be followed by a 40 50 basis point cut in mortgage rates
3034632 it wouldnt surprise me to see one of the big four break ranks
3034633 then we might start seeing some competition but its not a foregone conclusion none of them will give an undertaking to pass on the full cut

3034723 i am so happy my dream to see india win an individual gold medal in the olympics before i die has been fulfilled
3034724 bindras feat makes me feel like i have got my olympics medal back his success is an inspiration to young sportspersons and especially the olympics team there to do their best if you ask me bindra should be awarded the bharat ratna once he is back home
3034725 i have always told people that one cant say how many medals can be won but that doesnt mean that you are any less hardworking abhinav worked hard for four years for this one day and he did it
3034726 i would also say that abhinav had luck on his side he went with an aggressive mindset first and then became defensive which worked for him lets just hope that we get more medals those like badminton player saina nehwal for instance are doing very well
3034727 its a great day in the history of indian sports finally we have won an individual gold the last time we saw a gold medal was when the indian hockey team won it in 1980 the youth in the country have got a new icon in abhinav bindra i hope they will now be drawn more towards olympic sports

3034729 we realize that tibet is in the news because of the olympic games but we will not allow the world to forget tibet just because the olympic games have ended
3034730 we believe that after the world has seen chinas showcase of digitizing its people during the opening ceremony we can expect much greater participation in our next light protest
3034731 our people are already working on getting the appropriate permits from police and local authorities around the world
3034732 the candle for tibet initiative is a most wonderful thing fitting in with the tibetan tradition of lighting votive lamps in long rows in temples and in special butter lamp houses outside we seem powerless to ameliorate conditions on the ground in tibet in the present crisis moment this peaceful prayer vigil since it focuses the minds of many millions on the different sufferings of tormented and tormentor alike is a powerful way to intervene and it does not preclude anything else we can think of and do further on i hope everyone who reads this will join in this important effort
3034733 we have been receiving fantastic reports from all over the world

3034735 promise grants are designed to bring the worlds best minds together people who might not ordinarily collaborate and to provide those experts with the resources to focus and solve one serious problem in breast cancer and to get results to patients quickly
3034736 we are addressing the large gap in funding for this kind of research and we are addressing it in a big way
3034737 american was quick to recognize with us that substantial amounts of funding are needed now to research and halt inflammatory breast cancer through this first promise grant american is making a critical investment in comprehensive treatment for this rare disease
3034738 these airplanes will be a visible reminder virtually everywhere of the work still left to do in the breast cancer fight
3034739 the employees of american airlines and american eagle are very proud to support susan g komen for the cure
3034740 while tremendous strides have been made in the overall treatment of breast cancer until now theres been very little research into this rare disease that behaves so differently than other breast cancers
3034741 the global cancer community will stand to benefit from our comprehensive research program and what we learn about this disease the only way to achieve better outcomes for women with the disease is to have dedicated resources such as the funds allocated by komen and american airlines for continued ibc research

3034810 die art und weise wie heute informationen von den jugendlichen aufgenommen werden hat sich grundlegend ver ndert

3034812 jugendliche sch tzen am netz besonders die h here aktualit t der informationen ihre kostenlose verf gbarkeit und das bessere handling sie wollen kurz und kompakt informiert werden
3034813 die gruppe jener jungen deutschen die filme und serien nicht mehr ber tv sondern via internet konsumiert w chst deutlich an
3034814 auch die m glichkeit der nicht zeitgebundenen nutzung und das umgehen von unliebsamer tv werbung spielen in dieser hinsicht eine wichtige rolle

3034822 moodys expects eskoms external borrowings to rise substantially over the next five years
3034823 credit metrics are expected to be very weak in the next few years with financial ratios that in isolation would position eskom in the speculative grade rating category for a utility with a high business risk profile
3034824 although were deeply disappointed with the downgrade eskom retains its investment grade rating and will have continued access to local and global capital markets
3034825 such as escalating land prices inadequate coordinated funding the capacity of targeted beneficiaries and funding for rehabilitating collapsed agricultural infrastructure

3034827 theyve done some geographic work and identified the best prospects in the eastern part of the country
3034828 some of that is commercial land some of that is currently occupied in various ways by family agriculture theres a kind of a corporate heads of strategy around support programmes acquisition and so on which have been developed
3034829 the geographic work is also linked to climate change those areas are where rainfall would be most likely to be prevalent in the immediate term

3034832 there is a significant need in biology to be able to image at high resolution
3034833 metamaterials would be a better optical imaging method since it would be non invasive
3034834 in the case of such cloaks or shields the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock
3034835 an observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it making it seem to disappear
3034836 to scale up such a material to sizes visible to the naked eye will be very time consuming and very costly
3034837 the fish net structure is counter intuitive because as we stack the material in layers the energy loss is reduced instead of increased
3034838 thanks for your opinion i really am happy with my tattoo its just what i wanted could you pass the bean dip please
3034839 if you think this one sucks you should see the one on my ass
3034840 its something i always wanted and it turned out just the way i wanted it
3034841 so what do you plan on telling your daughter when she asks to get a tattoo
3034842 i will tell her that she needs to make sure it holds meaning for her and not something because its popular at the moment and not until she is 21 yrs old and lives as an adult
3034843 never in all my years of attending public hearings have i seen one organisation put forward so many of its units to repeat the same message
3034844 judging by the applause which i received and other people who spoke in favour of the scorpions there is clearly a strong body of public opinion that is opposed to their dissolution
3034845 there is a particular need for this in the eastern cape given the high levels of organised crime and corruption
3034846 it is well known that the current form of the scorpions has had a successful conviction rate in the region of 80 to 90 the combination of skills such as intelligence gathering criminal investigators and prosecutors working in one team bear this out
3034847 given their success rate and the increases in crime in the eastern cape we need more of the scorpions not less if we are going to stamp out organised crime
3034848 the reasons for the establishment of the dso have surely not changed
3034849 this province is facing an onslaught of crime which needs to be combated with every effective tool at our disposal
3034850 the disbanding of the dso in its current form will hamper these efforts and is a retrogressive step in the fight for a safer province and clean administration
3034851 criminal activity impacts negatively on the economy given the high levels of poverty in the eastern cape we need more effective policing not less
3034852 the aim of these public hearings is to accord ordinary citizens a platform to engage the committees
3034853 public hearings have always played a crucial role in shaping the legislative direction which parliament has championed over the past decade
3034854 the scorpions service the rich and do plea bargains while core criminals run around the streets
3034855 we are positive that the scorpions will be dissolved because a majority of people here have said so
3034856 in 2004 the government disbanded the south african narcotics bureau and since then drug related crimes have multiplied
3034857 it is apparent that the powers that be are hell bent on dissolving the scorpions just as they did the other saps special units such as the child protection unit we have seen and experienced the negative effects of such strategy
3034858 these few realities are sufficient cause for the scorpions to be retained and in fact be strengthened if the unit is doing its job and is investigating the anc and its alliance partners office bearers then so be it government and the ruling party are not above the law
3034859 were a core group of people who are so interested in it we want to restore organs and share our knowledge of them

3034862 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
3034863 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
3034864 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
3034865 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
3034866 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
3034867 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
3034868 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town
3034869 the national western stock show isnt partisan it doesnt take sides
3034870 its an opportunity to bring people of all different backgrounds culture races together thats what the west is really about

3034880 the progress is ongoing and we continue to add new animals and exhibits
3034881 the company acquired animal paradise in early march and began major renovations to reinvigorate the park today our park is open to the public and visitors are enjoying the ability to interact with hundreds of wild animals in addition to the vast free roaming area we have expanded a shady walk through area with exotic animal exhibits and added an air conditioned snack bar and family style gaming arcade to complement our popular petting zoo and go cart ride

3034890 when i post new things will my friends actually see them
3034891 have my friends posted something that im not seeing the news feed is cluttered right now with people i dont care about
3034892 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3034893 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3034894 a large part of efforts to force georgian authorities to peace in south ossetia
3034895 thats why we not only have to denounce this but we have to work to stop the fight
3034896 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3034897 we wanted to make wyd08 a unique experience by using new ways to connect with todays tech savvy youth

3034900 i think that 20 somethings and 30 somethings will watch this show and laugh along but still come away learning something
3034901 traffic is moving smoothly now the people were arrested for burning and vandalising the 30 buses near the putco bus depot
3034902 the angry protesters were transported to work and some to home after they set alight the buses
3034903 we were angry when the bus tickets were not sold some of us didnt go to work and putco is unreliable and we dont have other means of transport
3034904 our new ticket sellers were intimidated by unknown men when they were busy selling tickets and we wanted to protect them
3034905 it is quite clear that the judge did not apply her mind as bias was exercised from the onset in favour of her colleagues in the law society
3034906 the manner in which the judgment was arrived at again begs the question as to whether ordinary working class south africans can really depend on judges who appear to be more and more incapable of taking independent and objective decisions
3034907 the men then forced workers onto the floor at gunpoint and made one cashier fill a plastic bag with cash

3034910 congratulated all the parties to the negotiations for exhibiting this sense of collective and shared responsibility
3034911 we spent all night yesterday in discussions and some of the things that were holding back at times i nearly raised my fist but he remained cool
3034912 it is simply a tax on business failure and makes no sense
3034913 in trying to fill holes in his budget alistair darling is causing more chaos to the economy with an ill conceived move that is hurting regeneration and reducing the supply of affordable property that is essential for business
3034914 the tax is causing older buildings to be demolished early and new projects to be shelved the result will be less available property and higher rents when demand begins to recover
3034915 if you cant stop smoking exercise will mitigate some of the effects
3034916 i think in terms of the bowling efforts mendis was the difference his picking up 26 wickets was a major factor
3034917 when murali and mendis bowl together it is not easy to get runs out of them and we kept losing wickets because of the pressure created by the two
3034918 reading mendis is a mystery i dont think there is any mystery but it is a great effort from him picking up 26 wickets
3034919 the batsmen did not bat well here p sara oval in the third test and it probably cost us the series
3034920 it was critical for the middle order to score runs and there was just not enough consistency from any of the batsmen and that probably what cost us the game and the test series here
3034921 having won the toss it was important to get a big score
3034922 we had a good start but could not capitalise people get good starts and score twenties and thirties but the failure was not to build on those innings
3034923 also for a new batsman to go straight away and face two spinners is never easy had those who had good starts converted them into bigger scores it would have been a different story
3034924 i do not want to give excuses but overall we did not play quality cricket to win the series

3035137 it appears the banks debt will not be paid from the sale of the assets
3035138 the banks will suffer a substantial deficiency and therefore theres no chance of creditors getting a dividend hence shareholders will not have any likelihood of a return
3035139 the provision of desktop computers is one of the areas under consideration as part of sir peters independent review of the australian governments use and management of ict
3035140 typically agencies replace their computer workstations on a rolling three to four year time scale
3035141 in selecting a product agencies abide by the australian government procurement guidelines and will consider a range of value characteristics including price support and efficiency
3035142 an interdepartmental committee has been established to identify opportunities for government to lead by example and reduce greenhouse gas emissions waste energy and water use in government operations
3035143 this includes opportunities to reduce energy use in government buildings including energy use in lighting air conditioning and heating computers and other electrical equipment
3035144 their recommendations will be considered by government and the committee will also oversee the implementation of election commitments
3035145 the environmental purchasing guide and the green office guide produced by the department of the environment water heritage and the arts assist agencies in this regard
3035146 many agencies have instituted environmentally friendly policies for paper usage and recycling toner cartridge recycling and computer equipment disposal
3035147 many agencies with offices around australia have invested in videoconferencing facilities providing an alternative to air travel
3035148 these results are going to be less about 2008 and more about 2009 and 2010
3035149 we will see how the timetable of the it transformation is going and how many customers have been moved on to the new system
3035150 reduce total cost of ownership through migration to a single crm and billing platform across the entire company
3035151 its making sure our support areas such as it are sitting in one area accountable to one part of the business and they can support what our business needs particularly when were moving into such a large program of work
3035152 you want your key areas under the control of one person to make sure theyre working as effectively as possible
3035153 each system has been assessed for current and future requirements including operating cost components
3035154 the strategy takes account of like for like replacement for those applications that have ongoing use and scopes new initiatives that are planned for the 2009 14 period

3035157 dragon with seven heads and ten horns and upon its heads seven diadems
3035158 i had 10 or 15 people on my team two thirds lawyers a couple accountants a couple regular people
3035159 we looked at taxes and financial statements political positions and the most distasteful part personal behavior

3035161 we turned over 30 banker boxes full of material to a law firm in d c
3035162 i never knew that semifinal fixture will clash with our departure on saturday at this stage i prefer not make any comment until after our meeting with the bafana bafana technical team at 2pm this afternoon
3035163 its very important for the government and the regulator to maintain the impetus towards competition and not to allow the nbn to be the sole supplier of infrastructure in competitive areas
3035164 its a peculiarly australian phenomenon for the cable operator to rely so heavily on competitors assets even in areas where it has its own network
3035165 its a mistake to allow optus to unbundle telstras local loop in the footprint of its hfc network it removes an opportunity to maximise infrastructure competition between the two networks
3035166 if you get infrastructure competitors to invest in infrastructure you get product differentiation and essentially you get an investment race
3035167 its fair to say from the optus perspective that telstra is pretty adept at twisting the facts
3035168 the problem in australia is that there was insufficient policy to properly govern telstras hfc rollout telstra was allowed to overbuild the optus hfc network and was allowed to take a dominant position in pay tv
3035169 those two factors destroyed the viability of optuss rollout because we didnt have the key point of differentiation
3035170 they essentially had a head start in the investment race
3035171 we will find over time that australia will have one ubiquitous broadband network with limited infrastructure based competition
3035172 obviously the job advertisements are down but it still hasnt deteriorated significantly
3035173 the reason for that is employers still know they have to keep good talent for when it the market bounces back
3035174 i dont think that there is going to be mass retrenchments but there will be very limited hiring and the same thing applies to contractors
3035175 this is probably the first sign we have seen of the new media softening
3035176 although there are things making their way through the system such as tax cuts and oil pricing not getting any worse i still think the global financial jitters will continue to hurt all australian employers
3035177 the trend is still down and there are no obvious signs of recovery
3035178 with the new financial year now in swing this could be worrying signs for the it market in australia
3035179 however it could also point to differing methods of recruitment and less reliance by organisations on traditional internet job boards for finding people
3035180 this could be the only sector said to be affected by the
3035181 capital works programs can only begin in july with the new budgets and that includes the it specialists required to run the programs
3035182 the july increase was not so significant when viewed over the quarter and compared month on month
3035183 when you turn your car on does it return the favor

3035188 i think the heat from the popcorn machine was an attraction
3035189 someone noticed it move so they went to investigate it
3035190 i dont think they realised just how deadly this thing was he said
3035191 they werent far from it maybe a metre it could have been bad
3035192 we found a dead rodent the day before so now we assume the snake and the rodent had words and the snake won
3035193 id be worried if we had a repeat of this incident
3035194 it could have been a much different outcome brown snakes can be very dangerous
3035195 we have lizards getting in all the time they are part and parcel with the territory but to have a western brown is a lot more serious

3035198 the exchange regulatory authority under their reference gi12958 dated 23 august 2007 have advised as follows
3035199 under the current exchange control policy selling commission should not exceed 10 percent
3035200 in the light of the above the club is supposed to remit usd20 000 40 percent of usd50 000 sale price and retain usd30 000 60 percent of the sale price
3035201 the club can only pay selling commission up to a maximum of usd5 000 which the club can now only pay usd2 000 since a payment of usd3 000 has already been remitted under exchange control reference
3035202 working in a market like china is very challenging from a cultural perspective there was a lot of uncertainty about this 3g technology and as it was vendor agnostic we were required to train hundreds of people in its use
3035203 china has now proven it can deliver technological breakthroughs on the world stage although perhaps not a breakthrough technology td scdma will underpin the framework for 4g mobile technologies in the future
3035204 chinas censorship firewall wasnt an issue as it sits outside the carriers control
3035205 the political bureaucracy on the other hand was not so easy to navigate
3035206 but by the same token the chinese government owns all the operators there so its not like in australia where you will see carriers go head to head with the government on all manner of arguments

3035210 it fails to achieve the right balance between the competing policy interests in this area
3035211 the real risk arising from the implementation of data breach legislation is to trivialise notification obligations in the mind of consumers to such an extent that they become meaningless and ineffective in terms of real data protection
3035212 in fact the potential damage to consumers of a blanket notification obligation could be twofold on the one hand it can create unjustified anxieties and on the other hand it may result in a lack of proper attention to more serious incidents for example if consumers come to regard numerous less serious data breach notification emails as a form of spam
3035213 this could include where an agencys internal processes have dealt appropriately with the person or system responsible for the disclosure and the individual to which the personal information relates has not been affected by that disclosure

3035224 this is not the first time that a qassam has been fired towards israel while there may be two sides committed to the ceasefire in actuality the palestinian side is finding it very difficult to control all the militias and the qassam fire the attack today serves as a reminder that the government of israel should be working to fortify the communities in the line of fire as soon as possible

3035265 science is a matter of faith and evolution is just part of its dogma
3035266 yes we say those things at every talk because they are true and part of our argument against darwinism
3035267 hey look a creationist speaker is saying typical creationist things
3035268 i think something like this bingo card is trite and not just for evolution vs creation any well tread argument abortion gun control the death penalty the existence of god etc will have people on both sides repeating the same points and using terms typical of their side the mere fact that you can show repetition or stereotypical language isnt a counter argument
3035269 absolutely appalled by what coral ridge ministries is doing i had no knowledge that coral ridge ministries was planning a tv special on darwin and hitler and i find the thesis of dr kennedys program utterly misguided and inflammatory

3035273 most mainstream historians jewish and xian blame the holocaust on the combination of german culture and german xianity
3035274 it was the mass organizational powers of the modern state along with modern technologies and ideas on how to kill tons of people at once that really seem to be whats
3035275 not any random political philosophy that justifies the use of power to kill its not like human beings have ever lacked for some rationale to justify that
3035276 the monkeys our ancestors of prehistoric times are strictly vegetarian
3035277 humanity the universal church or the sovereign ego divorced from the bonds of blood are no longer absolute values for us they are dubious even moribund dogmas which represent the ousting of nature in favour of abstractions the emergence in the nineteenth century of darwinism and positivism constituted the first powerful though still wholly materialistic protest against the lifeless and suffocating ideas which had come from syria and asia minor and had brought about spiritual degeneracy

3035292 in a country that shuns homosexuality this makes perverse sense as after a sex change operation one technically isnt attracted to ones own sex and therefore isnt gay

3035314 able to independently discern the name maya kassandra soetoro from artifacts left behind in the process of forging a new fake document for barack from an image of mayas original document
3035315 take responsibility to verify the eligibility of mr barack h obama to be president of the united states
3035316 mr obama has refused to produce a physical certified stamped copy of his birth certificate an electronically displayed imaged displayed by his official campaign website has alleged to have been a forgery we request that the fec require mr obama to authorize the fec to obtain an official copy of his birth certificate
3035317 i am looking for 50 brave men or women from 49 states and the district of columbia to join me in suing the secretaries of state in our respective states to prevent them from posting the name barak h obama on the november 2008 ballot until he presents incontrovertible proof that he is a u s citizen
3035318 the secretaries of state are the ones who by placing a person or initiative on the ballot certify that the candidates or initiatives meet the legal requirements to be on the ballot
3035319 the office of the president is simply too important to trust to someone other than a person whose loyalties are 100 percent american and while it is impossible to read into the heart of a man or woman we do have the test our forefathers gave us which is this office is not to be entrusted to anyone but a natural u s citizen
3035320 the revelation that the birth certificate of obamas own sister was evidently used to create the electronic forgery represents what supporters of this analysis claim is a smoking gun that appears to implicate sen
3035321 the stakes couldnt be higher even the snopes anti rumor site acknowledges that obamas constitutional fitness to be president depends solely on his being born in the united states because his mother not yet 19 at the time of his birth would not have had a sufficient number of years as an adult citizen according to the laws prevailing at the time to pass on natural born citizenship automatically
3035322 there have been reports so far unconfirmed that obama was born outside the country either in kenya his presumed fathers native land or in canada the fact that the obama campaign has been touting as genuine a forgery since june 12 will likely increase pressure to not only account for the fake but produce a genuine paper birth certificate obama in his book dreams from my father specifically mentioned having such a document in his possession but it has not been submitted for public inspection or analysis if it in fact exists
3035323 if obama were born outside the united states one could argue that he would not meet the legal definition of natural born citizen because u
3035324 so she wouldnt have met the requirement of five years after the age of 16
3035325 natural born citizen under article ii section 1 of the constitution of the united states

3035370 i love the idea of the back nine of a major on a sunday
3035371 i love it so much that im actually disappointed im seven months away from the next major and i dont know what im going to do
3035372 and definitely ive turned up at other events and unless i get into contention you know sometimes it feels like a race like a sprint whereas a major feels like a marathon
3035373 i feel like i can be patient and take my time and i love the feeling of knowing that its going to come down to the back nine its going to come down to who can do it under pressure in the last nine holes
3035374 that is an issue for me that i do have to play better when i feel confident about my game in a normal week when i have plenty of good performances

3035378 when you are nervous you are in a different environment and things change and we both changed and did things differently

3035390 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3035391 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3035392 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3035393 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3035394 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3035395 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3035396 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3035397 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3035404 the word charter conjures the image of a break from the district and a break from the union
3035405 we feel it is extremely important the staff have a say particularly in who the administration at the school should be
3035406 the biggest fear was how many more rules would we have to comply with
3035407 ive heard there are other schools in the valley following what is happening at colfax and i wouldnt be surprised if others go that route
3035408 this is whats wrong with the district in a nutshell
3035409 as an affiliated charter all the budgetary stuff is still handled by l a unified
3035410 its the natural thing to do to take one more step
3035411 this gives us freedom to include all our arts and the things that make it easier for students to learn
3035412 it was a shame we werent able to work it out
3035413 im frustrated that if youre a public school in l a unified and you want to innovate your only choice is to leave the district and go charter

3035430 what have you done in the past 3 months to build relationships with potential referral partners
3035431 links teacher preparation to service in the most disadvantaged schools
3035432 we have a pipeline of human capital wanting to teach in schools with a fresh start
3035433 if im working eight to twelve hours a day i want to be happy
3035434 if i can make a difference in the life of a child thats it
3035435 she does not give off good energy she didnt make eye contact with me
3035436 someday the truth about her is going to come out
3035437 a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there and there will be no consequences
3035438 it looks at the whole range of risks and looks at them from a national perspective
3035439 it is the first time all of this has been brought together in this way
3035440 her passion and her interest to talk about something that really bothered her and to have it reach every corner of the world was an experience that shell never forget
3035441 i see kids that dont traditionally do well in school succeed because this was another way for them to express themselves
3035442 it is lots of work but work i look forward to there are always new things new opportunities its exciting
3035443 presentation of learned information makes for realistic contextual emotional connections
3035444 su voto es su voz your vote is your voice

3035446 in the sfett i learned lots of different ways to communicate through technology how to gather information speak make a presentation project myself throw in a joke every so often
3035447 the program really focuses on using the computer as a tool to express ideas in school it is sometimes hard for students to express themselves
3035448 the only way to get things done is through teamwork
3035449 working in this program has completely changed the students outlooks their lives

3035451 they claim its been going in budget support but thats not the answer were talking about us 700 million a year missing the rest has been taken by mush for some scheme or other and weve got to find it
3035452 absolutely president musharraf will prove all this wrong there is no way he will quit now quietly while being blamed for corruption
3035453 to be remembered on the right side of history they dont want to be remembered against democratic forces

3035457 when all of the judicial and appeal processes have exhausted themselves if any of the three are subject to a death penalty australia will make a plea of clemency on their behalf at that time

3035459 major sequeira has not benefited from any formal training or accreditation in the management of searching for missing persons
3035460 the search officers with the exception of the search and rescue team dispatched from lisbon had not benefited from any formal training in search procedures

3035463 nobody did a damn thing nobody and now the damage is done
3035464 ive seen homes from explosion before where its nothing but a pile of rubble i didnt see any of that here
3035465 we are thinking of organising elections which we want to be transparent and democratic
3035466 we are used to respecting our commitments so for this reason we cannot take the risk of giving a date which might not be respected
3035467 i cant say now whether i will be a candidate because it depends on the future i wont rule it out but i am not saying i will be a candidate either
3035468 i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels i believe we have to do all of those things to restore our economy
3035469 mandates subsidies tariffs and price supports that focus exclusively on corn based ethanol and prevent the development of market based solutions which would provide us with better options for our fuel needs
3035470 i dont support agricultural subsidies no matter where they are
3035471 the farm bill 300 billion is something america simply cant afford
3035472 for sure he cant lose missouri and thats in the upper midwest could he lose iowa minnesota and wisconsin and still be elected president yes but i wouldnt advise him to have that strategy

3035485 we will take it as we take all of our matches but we will wait until after training on tuesday to see which players will play
3035486 brazil is known for strong attacking but we also have a good defensive team we go into every game with the mentality that we are not going to concede that is something that spreads from our forwards to our defenders but also we have to score of course that is the key
3035487 i dont think i could do what youre doing it just seems like it would highlight the negatives and bring me down why not just focus on the good
3035488 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3035489 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3035490 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3035491 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3035492 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3035493 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3035494 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3035495 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3035496 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3035497 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3035498 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3035499 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

3035547 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
3035548 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country

3035550 there will also be tie ins with sony when her new album comes
3035551 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3035552 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3035553 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3035554 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3035555 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3035556 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3035557 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3035558 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3035559 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3035560 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3035561 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3035562 this is stuff you see other people do and you think thatd be awesome

3035568 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3035569 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem

3035573 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3035574 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3035575 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3035576 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3035577 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3035578 president obama and a democratic congress will likely dole out entitlements like free health care child care and cash payments to anyone who falls under a certain income level that means that people who drink gin all day long will be getting some of my hard earned money folks who dropped out of school who are too lazy to hold a job and who smoke reefer 24 7 will all get some goodies in the mail from uncle barack and aunt nancy

3035580 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3035581 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3035582 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3035583 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3035584 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3035585 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3035586 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3035587 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3035588 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3035589 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3035590 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3035591 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3035592 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3035593 we can switch to smarter cleaner forms of power and take advantage of free energy sources like the wind and sun the answer is simple power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within ten years
3035594 we are taking this message to a national audience because this goal is both ambitious and attainable
3035595 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced
3035596 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
3035597 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
3035598 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
3035599 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
3035600 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
3035601 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
3035602 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
3035603 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
3035604 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
3035605 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
3035606 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3035607 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3035608 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3035609 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3035610 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3035611 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
3035612 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3035613 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3035614 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3035615 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3035616 you dont have to attack the united states to put us on our back you just cut 30 percent of the oil
3035617 global warming is on page two for me page one is foreign oil
3035618 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3035619 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3035620 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3035621 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3035622 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3035623 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3035624 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3035625 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3035626 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3035627 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3035628 the wall street journal gets a gigantic miss for taking at face value the recent actions of moqtada al sadr rather than a surrender i think his recent actions are the start of hezbollah south with strong support from iran the real nature of transformation will become apparent once the united states troops are withdrawn
3035629 amounts to improper conduct inasmuch as it is conduct unbefitting a counsel and attorney
3035630 ralph nader is not a protest candidate he is not for sale and neither is my vote
3035631 i am not voting for a third party or a third person nor is my vote a protest vote and obama has the support of democrats not necessarily liberals liberals like myself are backing ralph nader
3035632 third or fourth party presidential candidates could garner enough votes in november to make a difference in some of the hotly contested swing states
3035633 i cant vote for anybody who doesnt call for an immediate end to the war in iraq
3035634 the war under post nuremburg laws is a criminal war of aggression its illegal we have no right as a nation to debate the terms of the occupation we have no right to be there
3035635 a few things we wont tolerate personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
3035636 personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
3035637 campaigns and parties often use dirty tricks to suppress the vote
3035638 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
3035639 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
3035640 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
3035641 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
3035642 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
3035643 we simply must do everything we can in our power to slow down global warming before it is too late the science is clear the global warming debate is over
3035644 americans are coming to understand that global temperatures have actually cooled over the last 10 years and are predicted to continue cooling over the next 10
3035645 if you look from 1995 you dont see any change that could be regarded as statistically significant for the last 13 or 14 years nothing has been happening
3035646 if you take the last 30 years its completely evident that its going up
3035647 this is a challenge for climate modelers we dont fully understand it
3035648 if we knew the answer to things like this one would have more confidence
3035649 the whole notion that something outside has to cause a change is absurd
3035650 weve looked at the sun volcanoes are not doing anything weird the oceans can dump heat into the atmosphere but theyre getting warmer too
3035651 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
3035652 thats second nature to me whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
3035653 is different than anything ive ever done that kind of has a pop quality to it
3035654 when i was a kid growing up in the southwest i worked for a rodeo company
3035655 so we wanted to do the comedy to tip our hats to the old burt reynolds movies and we wanted our characters to be strong and have the toast be a thread that runs through the movie
3035656 i was really concerned about hollywood meets ted nugent with their extreme difference in philosophies
3035657 teds a good friend of mine and teds not a hater yeah hes got a strong agenda and he carries a gun but hes never pulled it on anyone he can be dangerous if you try to tread on him but he doesnt bring the hate to the table hes so fun he kept everybody in stitches
3035658 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
3035659 al gore heard me say that and said were going to get some people on opposite ends of confrontation like rosie and donald trump and put em on the tv
3035660 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
3035661 you realize that you know what 50 million spins as a writer compares to lennon the bee gees and billy joel
3035662 ive got a 35 greatest hits album in the store right now
3035663 you can imagine how much it meant to people who needed that song whether people hated it or loved it it left its mark
3035664 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3035665 most people who talk about courtesy of the red white and blue never even heard the song
3035666 if you read it word for word you know what it means lets go out and get the people responsible for 9 11 they attacked new york they attacked the pentagon they came and killed a bunch of innocent americans
3035667 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war
3035668 my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3035669 his presidency will be better judged 40 years from now
3035670 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say
3035671 if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
3035672 i think obama stands the best chance for the democratic party since clinton mccain is a good solid choice a smarter version of what we have we probably need a change and the economy needs a change and come election day ill have my mind made up
3035673 theres no more important voter in this media market than the hispanic swing vote
3035674 i think people like me feel proud of being in a thinking process rather than just going with one party
3035675 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3035676 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3035677 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3035678 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3035679 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3035680 just so you all know we did set a record
3035681 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3035682 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3035683 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3035684 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
3035685 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
3035686 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
3035687 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
3035688 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
3035689 we are constantly looking for ways to simplify our booking and payment process and enhance the customer experience
3035690 our relationship with western union is a great example of how we can provide greater flexibility and more options for new customers to choose jetblue for their travel needs paying with cash has never been easier
3035691 millions of consumers already know how easy it is to pay their bills using western union services
3035692 now jetblue customers will have the convenience of purchasing their airline travel in cash at the places they already do business every day what could be simpler than paying for your travel while you purchase groceries or fill up your gas tank
3035693 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
3035694 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
3035695 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
3035696 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
3035697 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
3035698 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
3035699 be tried for high crimes against humanity and nature i anticipate testifying against relevant ceos in future public trials
3035700 it will become impractical to constrain atmospheric carbon dioxide the greenhouse gas produced in burning fossil fuels to a level that prevents the climate system from passing tipping points that lead to disastrous climate changes that spiral dynamically out of humanitys control
3035701 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3035702 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3035703 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
3035704 are you better off now than you were four years ago
3035705 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
3035706 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3035707 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3035708 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3035709 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3035710 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3035711 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3035712 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3035713 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3035714 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3035715 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3035716 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3035717 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3035718 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3035719 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3035720 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3035721 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3035722 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3035723 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3035724 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3035725 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3035726 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3035727 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3035728 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3035729 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
3035730 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
3035731 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
3035732 what were hearing even from other members of the ndp party is that jack layton will advise his mps not to support this motion although they would if given freedom to vote their conscience and the will of their constituents
3035733 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3035734 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3035735 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3035736 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3035737 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3035738 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3035739 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3035740 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3035741 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3035742 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3035743 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3035744 but i dont really have a good argument that the government should be the one to prevent abortion because of my religious beliefs
3035745 yes the other issues do matter but as a christian my belief system supports the idea that human life is sacred it doesnt matter if that human life is accidental or the result of rape as tragic as those situations are human life is sacred
3035746 for many democratic activists and operatives the phrase white christian still conjures up images of finger wagging priests and scopes era fundamentalists
3035747 even if he makes a marginal improvement with that huge group of voters that could ultimately be very important in certain swing states like my state of virginia where evangelicals comprise a large portion of the voters
3035748 many will either sit on their hands on election day or even if they vote for mccain they wont be out there mobilizing the base and doing the hard work that these folks have done in the past for the republican party
3035749 there are some data that young evangelicals are focusing on a variety of issues not just the social issues but i dont see a voting shift taking place just because younger folks care about the environment doesnt mean thats going to trump their concerns about the life issues
3035750 thats the minimal step he has to take to reduce the animosity against him on abortion
3035751 and if he doesnt do even that hes basically kissing goodbye the chances of making deep inroads in the white evangelical vote
3035752 he has got to come out forcibly and talk about reducing abortions in america he has to forcibly come out and talk about education and abstinence programs
3035753 we evangelicals have to face the fact that when we speak on this issue we in the church do not have enough authority to convince people of that position and have to resort to the coercion of the law
3035754 we have lost our moral authority in this society we havent been able to impact our own community to the extent that we should
3035755 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3035756 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3035757 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3035758 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3035759 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3035760 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3035761 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3035762 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
3035763 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
3035764 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
3035765 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
3035766 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
3035767 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
3035768 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
3035769 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
3035770 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
3035771 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
3035772 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
3035773 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
3035774 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
3035775 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
3035776 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
3035777 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
3035778 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
3035779 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
3035780 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
3035781 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
3035782 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3035783 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3035784 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3035785 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3035786 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3035787 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3035788 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3035789 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3035790 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
3035791 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
3035792 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
3035793 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3035794 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3035795 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3035796 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3035797 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3035798 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
3035799 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
3035800 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
3035801 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3035802 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3035803 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3035804 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3035805 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
3035806 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
3035807 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
3035808 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
3035809 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
3035810 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
3035811 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3035812 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3035813 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3035814 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
3035815 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3035816 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3035817 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3035818 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3035819 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3035820 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3035821 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3035822 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3035823 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
3035824 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
3035825 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
3035826 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
3035827 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
3035828 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
3035829 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
3035830 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
3035831 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
3035832 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
3035833 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
3035834 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3035835 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3035836 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3035837 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3035838 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3035839 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3035840 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3035841 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3035842 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3035843 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3035844 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
3035845 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
3035846 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
3035847 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
3035848 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
3035849 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
3035850 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3035851 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
3035852 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
3035853 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
3035854 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
3035855 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
3035856 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
3035857 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
3035858 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
3035859 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
3035860 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
3035861 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
3035862 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
3035863 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
3035864 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3035865 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3035866 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3035867 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3035868 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3035869 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3035870 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3035871 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3035872 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3035873 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3035874 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3035875 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3035876 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3035877 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3035878 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3035879 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3035880 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3035881 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3035882 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3035883 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3035884 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
3035885 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3035886 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3035887 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
3035888 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
3035889 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
3035890 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
3035891 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
3035892 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
3035893 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
3035894 ill be so embarassed if i have to tell a game warden that the dog ate my license

3035899 one of the main reasons we originally moved into the x86 processor business was because we believed that ultimately the third party chipset market would disappear and we would need to have the capability to provide a complete platform
3035900 intel provides the vast majority of chipsets for its processors and following its purchase of ati amd is also moving very quickly in the same direction

3035922 patients may not be learning this information from their health care providers and information regarding colon cancer prevention is not as well publicized as it could be
3035923 in the context of busy clinic visits it is in some ways efficient for patients to be reminded that physical activity is good for their health in general going through each specific health benefit of physical activity would take considerable time
3035924 sedentary people should first set such moderate achievable goals more benefits could accrue from higher levels and more intense exercise to some extent more may be better but it is important to note that a little is much better than nothing

3035933 it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
3035934 i believe because of those things because of the holy spirit working in the church because the congregation wants to know jesus more all of this works together to double the number
3035935 the chinese government has recognized christians as a positive power in the construction of harmonious society so that is very important and significant because we as christians have ever since become a positive power in the construction of this country
3035936 this trip has reaffirmed my belief that men and women who desire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china
3035937 abdul sattar came to christian village on april 10th 2008 with his gang and opened fire on christians who didnt vote for him in the joint election system
3035938 javed masih died on spot by firing while fellow christian irshaad masih was seriously injured
3035939 threatened christian villagers of dire consequences in case they did not caste vote in his favor
3035940 why killers of my husband are still free where is fruit of joint election system
3035941 my husband is killed and they who proclaim that their fight is for christians and not their own interests or portfolios are enjoying government privileges
3035942 the police said we will first inquire whether adeel has committed suicide because the culprits told the police about the fact that their daughter wanted to embrace christianity because of adeel
3035943 in this way the police were biased and lingered on the matter because if there is a long delay in the lodging of a first incidence report the case becomes weak
3035944 they are associated with pedophile groups like nambla and others and have advocated lowering the age of consent to levels that would essentially foster pedophilia
3035945 for the u n to side with radical homosexual activists in this case has only served to further discredit the u n and i think its problematic in further damaging their reputation
3035946 right now we have athletes stories in spanish german chinese japanese and were working on getting it in russian french and arabic
3035947 but we really hope that this will open the door for people around the world who have a fascination and a love for sports and that theyre going to come to our site and not only see athletes or athletes from their country but theyre going to hear an athletes life change story in their own language
3035948 it is possible that the opposing side could appeal this decision to the state supreme court
3035949 that is not a guarantee and it is quite possible that this may be in fact a standing decision
3035950 and they used our taxpayer money to buy blue jeans music cds movie dvds radios television sets and dvd players
3035951 at the same time that the american taxpayer was being asked to bail these companies out barney frank the chairman of the financial services committee instituted a sort of tax on freddie and fannie and that tax goes into whats called an affordable housing trust fund
3035952 its a really a taxpayer subsidized housing fund but that money will go to organizations like la raza and acorn
3035953 the airport in tbilisi has been bombed and radar is not working

3035960 the commercial was produced by a local automobile distributor based on its own judgment and nissan motor has nothing to do with the commercial
3035961 its my opinion that nissan made a huge error by igniting these racist instincts we need to apply punishments against these things in order for nissan to keep its interests in the region it must apologize
3035962 is one of the most popular and successful automobile brands
3035963 set up a regional middle east headquarters in dubai thus becoming the first japanese car manufacturer to accomplish this feat
3035964 i am a believer in knowing what youre doing when you apply for a job uh and i think that if i were to seriously consider running on a national ticket i would essentially have to start now before having served a day in the senate now theres some people who might be comfortable doing that uh but im not one of those people
3035965 whether russia will push beyond these regions and further into georgia
3035966 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3035967 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3035968 georgians are wondering nato isnt coming deal with it saakashvilli staked his presidency on it and failed find new leaders leaders who will find a way of satisfying russian demands otherwise nothing will ever get better or change in georgia
3035969 provoked this fight and as the russians continue their drive to gori its clear that when this is over and the time to make peace arrives russia will be in a position of strength
3035970 that will not be lost on other states that share a border with russia
3035971 deaf hard of hearing or speech impaired people may experience difficulties in trying to contact tayside police using a mobile phone or standard phone because they cannot hear speech very well if at all
3035972 this new service means that deaf and hard of hearing people will be able to alert us to concerns they have quickly and effectively without having to ask someone to call on their behalf
3035973 with technology moving forward all the time its vital that we use the latest and most efficient means of communication for everybody in our local communities
3035974 i am delighted to see the launch of this invaluable text messaging service
3035975 it will empower deaf people to gain quick and easy access to tayside police and other emergency services where and when they need to
3035976 yo estoy sorprendido de que en pleno siglo xxi ocurra un incidente como el que estamos presenciando en primer lugar me parece que no es la iglesia cat lica la que est en problemas me parece que es un sector extremista de esa iglesia conocido como opus dei el opus dei representado por monse or arregui es el que est discutiendo algunos art culos del proyecto de constituyente
3035977 ocurre que en la constituci n que est sometida a la votaci n el 28 de septiembre las cosas est n puestas con una claridad absoluta se proteger la vida desde su concepci n pero cuando uno no quiere entender las palabras pues no las entiende y entonces vienen los argumentos que realmente son bien dif ciles de entender
3035978 el deseo es intervenir en pol tica porque monse or arregui como digno miembro del opus dei ve que el ecuador est sufriendo una transformaci n y para el opus dei una transformaci n es como para m una ara a me eriza la piel
3035979 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3035980 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
3035981 when they read off the new definition i remember being just a bit stunned
3035982 i wasnt prepared for just how specific the new definition would be
3035983 i knew they were re thinking the definition and i figured since they told that dog he couldnt be a planet anymore my days were probably numbered
3035984 i have never been so insulted how dare they lump me in with you lot i protest this in the strongest terms
3035985 one ring to rule them all one ring to find them one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
3035986 we expect if the situation stays the same that our income will be more than 70 billion this year
3035987 we can help alleviate shortages by drilling for oil and gas in our own country
3035988 we have got the opportunity to find more crude oil here at home
3035989 to introduce an entire new order of society to change it to an enlightened social system which shall gradually unite all interests into one and remove all cause for contest between individuals
3035990 to establish a system of national schools from which all religion was to be excluded our complete plan was to take the children from their parents at the age of 12 or 18 months and to have them nursed fed clothed and trained in these schools at the public expense the plan has been successfully pursued
3035991 are managed by a rather small knot of persons the elite judgment may be moulded as well as the will and the feelings
3035992 in the name of the past and the future the servants of humanity theoreticians and practitions come forward to claim as their due the general direction of this world in order to construct at length the true providence moral intellectual and material excluding once for all from political supremacy all the different servants of god catholics protestants or deists as at once belated and a source of trouble
3035993 sterilize all the unfit among whom i include all fundamentalists
3035994 the work of the civic church is to establish the kingdom of heaven here among men in other words to reconstitute human society the civic church embraces in its comprehensive synthesis all the religions from the fetish worshiper to the christian philanthropist the objective of the civic church includes the greatest possible good for the greatest possible number all must meet on the common ground of the service of man workers must be found who can look at the community as a whole they must endeavor by hook or by crook to get into existence some federation of the moral and religious forces which could be recognized by the community as having authority to speak in the name and with the experience of the civic church
3035995 an ideal selective humanitarian episcopate on democratic lines can be evolved
3035996 all the forces of civilization and religion will work for the establishment of the civic church
3035997 let us go slowly for a while until we can see how our plan works out in america
3035998 when i am back in washington i will see where your ideas can be put to use
3035999 sociometric principles dictated certain sacrifices for the benefit of the whole structure

3036012 as she walked towards me from the darkness of the garden into the light of the door i saw for the first time the most beautiful woman on earth a startling white face burning dark eyes a face so alive i felt it would consume itself before my eyes years ago i tried to imagine true beauty i created in my mind an image of just such a woman i had never seen her until last night yet i knew long ago the phosphorescent color of her skin her huntress profile the evenness of her teeth she is bizarre fantastic nervous like someone in a high fever her beauty drowned me as i sat before her i felt i would do anything she asked of me henry suddenly faded she was color and brilliance and strangeness by the end of the evening i had extricated myself from her power she killed my admiration by her talk her talk the enormous ego false weak posturing she lacks the courage of her personality which is sensual heavy with experience her role alone preoccupies her she invents dramas in which she always stars i am sure she creates genuine dramas genuine chaos and whirlpools of feelings but i feel that her share in it is a pose that night in spite of my response to her she sought to be whatever she felt i wanted her to be she is an actress every moment i cannot grasp the core of her everything henry has said about her is true

3036045 today one of the methods that includes racism is separatism the attempt to delimit the lands controlled by the white race by adapting and privatizing the wealth that belongs to the nation and its people we already knew these intentions in the form of the rich districts that sought to be defined as municipalities with the goal that a share of the taxes taken by law from their immense richnesses remains under their control to increase the revenue to their split off districts behind which they sought to insulate and to use a privately controlled security apparatus to guard their privileged life styles the separatist referendum is an oligarchic racist and economic device used because they want to keep the greatest part of the wealth of santa cruz for their own benefit and because the oligarchs want moreover to prevent the government of evo morales from continuing the process of land reform and extending all over the country
3036046 let us speak about autonomy not for the oligarchy but for the people with whom we struggle these separatist groups which have just lost their privileges were for a long time in the palace they controlled the country and allowed the plundering of our country our natural resources including its natural resources and the same with the privatization of our companies and now they once again want to reestablish this system which exposes their true interest economic control

3036076 we wanted to broaden the way we communicate and engage with our audience web based tv is more than broadcasting its a very cost effective and simple to use method of communicating we dont want to talk to our donors we want to talk with them and show them what is happening in the world websedge and web based tv enabled jhpiego to create an effective visual tool to open the lines of communication
3036077 people often seemed impressed but other than word of mouth feedback it was difficult to ascertain the impact of our marketing efforts and which funding leads we should be following up we needed to find a new effective channel through which we could engage policy makers and donors using web based tv and video allowed us to capture the reality of in depth on the ground project work where the outcome is literally a matter of life and death
3036078 non profits think that video is off limits because of the prohibitive costs they assume are involved our experience with websedge is that this is categorically not the case
3036079 as tv content and production experts we understand the challenges ngos face in getting information across to key policy makers and donors web based tv creates an immediate impact and the exposure we can provide at events where video can be streamed to multiple venues always creates a significant marketing return for our customers we are pleased to have helped support jhipegos important work that helps women in one of the most devastated regions of the world

3036203 valero operates 16 oil refineries across north america with a combined throughput capacity of over 3 million barrels per day bpd
3036204 high oil prices have helped energy companies book record profits refiners however have seen profits plummet because the difference in price between a barrel of refined product and a barrel of crude oil the so called crack spread narrowed
3036205 thanks to higher selling prices vlo reported a 49 year over year increase in net revenues in q1 however due to the surge in oil prices the companys throughput margin shrank 30 to 8 48 per barrel
3036206 the operating profit margin was further impacted by higher energy costs net income from continuing operations plunged 76 year over year to 261 million or 48 cents per share
3036207 similarly q2 net revenues increased 51 year over year and the throughput margin fell 40 from the year earlier period to 10 82 per barrel net income from continuing operations dropped 64 to 734 million or 1 37 per share
3036208 although margins were down year over year they improved considerably over q1 levels while oil prices remain high and volatile we are encouraged that they have been easing in recent weeks
3036209 vlos profit margins will expand even if gasoline prices fall as long as they hold up better than oil prices

3036218 we have all these different stories from everywhere he says he doesnt remember anything hes my client and i believe him until i see solid evidence that hes not who he says he is
3036219 he wanted to live in the big country and maybe get famous now that i see all this hes really famous

3036222 the generation of the 1940s were a generation which endured hunger strike the blanket in portlaoise the internment camp the gallows and the firing squad their sacrifice ensured the survival of the irish republican ideal
3036223 richard goss epitomised that generation the poet austin clarke in his poem the last republicans dedicated to the irish republicans of 1936 46 wrote that the generation of 1913 23 had inspired the succeeding generation
3036224 richard like his father was also an active trade unionist working in rawsons shoe factory he was an officer in the local branch of the national union of shoe and boot operatives
3036225 along with local republicans such as paddy murphy he trained in the cooley mountains
3036226 going on the run richard goss was appointed oc north leinster south ulster division of the ira in preparation for a campaign against british forces in the six counties
3036227 the executions of the 1940s the deaths on hunger strike all took place under the dark cloud of censorship
3036228 the funeral of richard goss is recorded in the pages of the united irishman by se mus g okelly
3036229 it was a military funeral in every sense of the word his coffin was lowered into the grave and after the clay had been filled in and the last post sounded there came the crack of the three volleys which told the assembled multitudes that another fenian grave had been made
3036230 we honour also today the memory of willie gaughran friend and comrade of richard goss captured on the english campaign in early 1939 he was sentenced to 10 years and sent to camphill prison isle of wight there he contracted tb and was released in 1946 he died some months later
3036231 today the cause which inspired richard goss to dedicate and ultimately sacrifice his life a free and independent ireland remains unfulfilled
3036232 meanwhile we hear calls for unity from many disparate elements irish republicans are described as elitist and backward if they are not willing to dilute their programme in the interest of this so called unity
3036233 it is true unity that is required to achieve the goal of irish freedom but it must be a real unity based on a common programme cohesive and coordinated and based on unequivocal republicanism
3036234 the republican movement provides such a programme it is the only vehicle which can deliver direction and leadership it has and remains in the words of d ith conaill the
3036235 the editorial of the united irishman in december 1957 pointed the way forward
3036236 by strict adherence to principles by pursuing a clearly defined policy by placing the national interest before personal considerations the irish republican movement has built up a reputation for honesty and integrity the irish people can put their trust in that movement sure in the knowledge that it will never betray them or their interests
3036237 the lessons are simple by sticking to the basic fundamentals of irish republicanism is the only means to ensure unity of purpose whilst delivering a clear and coherent message to the irish people

3036239 sen obama has already brought thousands of new kansans into the democratic party and into the political process people who may never have voted in an election before or taken part in a convention

3036241 when implementing an soa users are typically so busy worrying about how to move information that they tend to ignore whether or not it will be understood when it gets where it
3036242 you can connect things through web services but if your end points don
3036243 soa teams that integrate services with an interlocking web of point to point data mappings are undermining the fundamental soa principles of loose coupling
3036244 moreover untangling this web of mappings is difficult and makes change hard

3036248 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3036249 any of the campaigns that would have tried to push that would have been burned by it

3036346 the most pressure filled trial is nothing like a fight in front of 20 000 people even millions of people
3036347 people think athletes arent that smart to begin with especially boxers so getting a law degree gave me the ability to get some credibility in that regard
3036348 i think its unhealthy to look back and fixate on it
3036349 my medal i think its in a drawer somewhere we dont have pictures from the olympics up on the walls either
3036350 the olympics for me was very pressure filled and i have probably not all that many great memories from it quite frankly
3036351 i was fully expected to win the gold and coming up with a silver was a bit of a disappointment
3036352 it was like euphoria after i won but it didnt take long to say what now how do you beat this in life reaching a gold medal on a podium on the olympic games
3036353 it was kind of a reality check realizing this is only a small part of my life
3036354 i thought i was going to retch the first two years when that red light came on in the studio
3036355 i wasnt experienced i didnt have the training in the pool i could do it with my eyes shut
3036356 i didnt give up in the pool and i didnt give up at my job it takes patience perseverance and hard work you have to make it fun as well
3036357 one of the realizations i had was this is one of the best educations to try to do all this on my own without any real support
3036358 someone whos retiring in two weeks and has not prepared himself to have a career or doesnt have an education doesnt matter how much success they have it will probably be a rough time after
3036359 the architects envisage a cubicle that has several compartments which open up to reveal different units designed to serve as temporary residence in places where permanent homes are difficult to locate woonbox can be set up in spaces like offices and parks as makeshift measures woonbox would also come in handy for the poor and homeless as well as the class of populace that cannot afford large permanent establishments
3036360 had i learned how to love even as a 10 year old boy things would have been different
3036361 i keep referring back to this love thing its just so important to the universe you know it expands more than just an emotion its a way of life how we interact with each other and see each other its amazing i had to come to prison in order to be free and its stupid i guess but it happened
3036362 experiencing and observing ones misery with constancy and equanimity looking at it squarely with patience and fortitude is the path to experiential understanding and the liberation from suffering
3036363 this technique involves the observation of ordinary actual sensations throughout the body moment by moment and understanding their impermanent nature incrementally one overcomes deeply conditioned habitual reactions and emerges with a profound inner freedom and equanimity
3036364 with a burning interest in anthropology i think ive always been interested in different ways of seeing and understanding the world
3036365 i was living in a fairly well to do community
3036366 and was frustrated wanting to get into a tribe another tribal setting where id be living with people unlike myself and maybe less fortunate
3036367 it said if youre interested in volunteering to work in our local prison to teach a program called alternatives to violence call this number then i remember with one hand laying the paper down on the table and with the other hand picking up the phone and calling it was a eureka moment wow theres a prison down the street and this is another tribe when i walked into that prison for the first time i really felt i was crossing a border into a foreign land and i must say into a third world country
3036368 sitting in a group with 30 male prisoners in a medium security prison and when the door first opened and the prisoners came flowing into the room i was for a moment frightened but then i was fascinated by the potential and doggedness and commitment that these guys showed over the weekend i dont think ive turned back since that first day
3036369 as a therapist i wanted to do something that would get a little bit more personal talking about your own truth your own life your own past
3036370 could provide the structure and approach to further address personal suffering
3036371 at this olympic games everybody knows im 50 so when im in the piste it doesnt matter if i win or lose i want to show people im still young
3036372 i said it doesnt matter when we put on the mask well fence
3036373 this is the no 1 story for all of team canada at these games from the chinese perspective
3036374 the gold medalists in china are all household names really so shes a big star here
3036375 this is a great story for canada and for china
3036376 its over but this one was very special for me because its an olympics in china
3036377 he make me relax he make me concentrate he supports me lots
3036378 so she could be here we would do anything for her
3036379 i never really thought of my mom as you know a famous person or anything and like ive never been like amazed at like all the stories because shes my mom right shes just like another person but so like wait what was the question again
3036380 ive seen how much shes been through and one of her dreams shes told me now is she wants me to go to the olympics too because shes going to be really old and i dont want her trying again
3036381 one of the main reasons i want to go to the olympics one day is for her because its her wishes and shes done so much for me so i think i can do something for her
3036382 forget the product theyre all the same its all about emotion
3036383 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3036384 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3036385 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3036386 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3036387 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3036388 in the years weve been conducting this study weve never seen such dramatic year over year shifts in the rankings of the six domestic and foreign domestic automakers

3036396 sabol shouldnt just be in the hall of fame there should be a whole wing devoted to him and his work
3036397 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3036398 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3036610 to give due recognition to the work and contribution of guyanas first executive president
3036611 was also a despicable dictator who ran this country into utter ruins and in these times of crisis and hopelessness is this the best motion for the pnc to pass in parliament
3036612 to discover what is around the next corner what is over the hill up the road
3036613 why specifically a telephone exchange why do you want to find a telephone exchange
3036614 perhaps not specifically a telephone exchange but what i was trying to evoke was a place where people go every day to work maybe for their whole lives and one has managed to ignore it for ones whole life thats not really it though
3036615 you have to be careful about giving out your real name though ive heard about people who have been blackmailed
3036616 hovercraft manufacturing industry journals not that there would be many of those you dont get many hovercraft in these parts anymore
3036617 and besides theyre probably manufactured by the same companies that make aeroplanes and helicopters and the like
3036618 youve obviously never taken a night bus back from peckham
3036619 they become less and less different by the year one cannot escape the homogenising global culture except through specificness what i am concerned with is locating the specific and the unknown just off the beaten track of ones habitual circuit the shops and hovercraft and telephone exchanges themselves are unimportant
3036620 what one searches for is evidence that the world is larger that one knows more unknowable thats how the world seems when one is a child the field behind the park stretches on forever the interstellar spaces beyond ones experiences are filled with spectres appartitions and boojums
3036621 where one seeks new experiences one becomes increasingly disappointed as one ages
3036622 like a heroin addict one seeks increasingly obscure locations to jack up to release oneself from the monotony of the real world
3036623 one imagines him walking on a treadmill in front of a blank screen upon which angels project his progress through the nations of the earth
3036624 the w12 will take you there its a little bus that goes all around the houses
3036625 its not like the rest of asciibridge anyway youll get to sit on a bus for hours with lots of pensioners they might say anything
3036626 youre only young once but you can be immature forever

3036640 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists
3036641 for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
3036642 free speech zones police arrest them for trespassing or disorderly conduct and then detain them until the president or vice president is out of the area and the media leave

3036657 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3036658 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3036659 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
3036660 it ought to strike fear in the heart of every market favoring person that youve got major things undermining the public trust in our capital markets

3036673 kaka believes that a world record transfer to chelsea remains a strong possibility and that he could be a premier league player before the end of this month chelsea have made a 100m 78m offer for the brazilian forward who would be prepared to move to london if his club milan accept it
3036674 even though the world footballer of the year has not requested a transfer from milan and is contracted to the club until 2012 he has been unsettled by their handling of him in recent months the 26 year old was prevented from representing brazil at the olympics in beijing despite his club allowing summer signing ronaldinho to play and last week the clubs doctor questioned kak s decision to undergo close season knee surgery
3036675 defamation on internet bulletin boards is more like slander than libel a high court judge has ruled
3036676 for me the most interesting comment is that contributions in online communities and forums are give and take and like a casual conversation rather than published and printed material this is certainly more akin to the kind of conversations and contributions we see on our communities at as im sure it is for anybody else with experience in this area

3036678 illegally and in violation of the regulations of the protected areas act as well as of the order for pronouncing the national park rila there was included the regulated territory of panichishte village

3036688 you couldnt have a starker contrast between the multiple layers of check and balances at cbs and a guy sitting in his living room in his pajamas writing
3036689 gee if i were only to wait around like a dummy instead of actually playing the game maybe i would be able to see some meaningless and poorly translated intro scenes
3036690 the guys showed a lot of character after the second test
3036691 we have been consistent in recent years at home as well as away the younger players took responsibility and the seniors pushed themselves
3036692 both murali and mendis bowled very well and kept the pressure on a good indian batting line up
3036693 it was important to get a good first innings total but we faltered
3036694 the batters were not consistent throughout the series they let us down we had a chance to make up in the second innings but again we didnt score mendis was a key bowler for sri lanka and was well supported by murali
3036695 its been a great few days for the side after all the commotion over his appointment as captain after michael vaughans resignation
3036696 the boys pulled together we had a chat and said how we wanted to play this fixture and i couldnt have asked for anything more
3036697 south africa played some real good cricket 2 1 is pretty right
3036698 at lords we had the upper hand and then south africa drummed it into us for the next seven or eight days at headingley and edgbaston
3036699 weve tried our hardest but at the start of this new era i couldnt ask for anything more

3036704 while we had sincerely hoped to avoid further facility closures or consolidations we recognise that we must do everything in our control to pass along higher input costs we believe the actions announced today while painful are needed to position pilgrims pride to emerge from this down cycle as a much stronger more efficient competitor

3036718 nicholas negroponte had a vision to build a 100 laptop and give away millions to educate the worlds poorest children
3036719 the two mightiest high tech companies in the world looked on negropontes philanthropic scheme and decided it had to die
3036720 the degree to which commercial entities will go to disrupt a humanitarian project
3036721 the last thing you want to do for a shared use computer is have it be something without a disk and with a tiny little screen
3036722 wouldnt it be great if intel decided to get behind mits one laptop per child project created to bring children in africa into the 21st digital century
3036723 intel is competing against it with a hardcore commercial unit purpose designed to funnel corporate product into the homes of african families many if not most of whom are surviving at subsistence level or below
3036724 intel has apparently had a change of heart and we welcome them to the table
3036725 the thing we have been highlighting is that both parties are working towards the same goal
3036726 ntel and one laptop per child olpc today announced they have agreed to work together to bring the benefits of technology to the developing world through synergy of their respective programs says intel in a
3036727 bring learning opportunities to the most remote and poorest children of the world by providing connected low cost and rugged laptops to each and every child in their daily lives
3036728 joining olpc is a further example of our commitment to education over the last 20 years and our belief in the role of technology in bringing the opportunities of the 21st century to children around the world
3036729 microsoft is to begin field tests of windows xp working on the so called 100 laptop or xo early in 2008
3036730 it has not committed to offering xp on the xo laptop but hopes to release the operating system in the first half of 2008 if the trials succeed
3036731 hasnt committed ha you can bet your nether regions bill and the boyz would kill to somehow get their system on the olpc laptops
3036732 how else would they get all those new computer users in all those lovely developing countries addicted to ms crud
3036733 intel and olpc will explore collaborations involving technology and educational content
3036734 its hard to pinpoint a start date with the nature of ethnographic research in which ethnographers collect data over a long period of time
3036735 which is chartered to extend pc access to the worlds next billion users
3036736 that they waited until very late in the day to make it nearly impossible for olpc representatives on the east coast to get their side of the story in the first stories
3036737 destructive as all this sounds it represents a kind of success for olpc
3036738 first whatever intel tries not to say it is almost certain that the olpc inspired the classmate and cheap computers from others
3036739 if nicholas hadnt said what he said in january 05
3036740 this machine wouldnt be here and a lot of other technologies and discussions wouldnt be here he accelerated people getting access by probably years
3036741 and finally however impure it may be to the open sourcers putting windows on the xo was a huge breakthrough in the computing industry because microsoft has let them have windows xp for 3 per computer
3036742 the large campaign donations by the crayola cartel to the mccain campaign had nothing to do with the granting of exclusive marketing and licensing rights for the color surge

3036755 there are no words to describe the terrible suffering of my people at this moment the chinese government is relentlessly crushing the tibetan people when they desire nothing more than the restoration of their basic rights and freedom tibetans are being killed silenced and marginalized our precious religion strangled as the chinese government attempts to extinguish all trace of tibetan identity i am protesting today to tell the world that while it stares mesmerized at chinas olympic games my people are being crushed under the boot of chinese oppression

3036757 its great working with an independent developer on a video for their software they take great pride in their product and great interest in what we do making our job much easier and very effective

3036762 if that is being on the back burner then you guys need to come teach a class for us
3036763 yes he was running high for a few days but if you will notice it was just before school started and he was excited and nervous if you will look at the days after school started you will see that he calmed down and so did his numbers
3036764 oh yes he has been waking up a bit on the high side as of late this is i believe in part to the new schedule and because his hormones are starting to kick in i wanted to give the school schedule a week to settle before making any adjustments
3036765 this was a cold blooded multiple murder carried out in a savage way
3036766 basically what the court is suggesting here is that giving a presentation involving security to other security researchers is a violation of federal law
3036767 as far as i know this is completely unprecedented and it has a tremendous chilling effect on sharing this sort of research and we intend to fight it with everything weve got

3036773 es el r o m s caudaloso y necesita que se creen m s embalses ya que se vierte mucha agua en el mar y que se utilice lo que sobra de beneficio para todos los espa oles
3036774 cuando el sentido com n llegue a las personas se crear n m s autopistas de agua para que sin quitar una gota de agua a nadie que la necesite la sobrante se trasporte a otros lugares donde falta para mantener la situaci n de solidaridad de estabilidad econ mica y de progreso que buscamos todos para espa a
3036775 siempre que haya un consenso entre los que dan y los que reciben
3036776 aunque esta es una soluci n a largo plazo si es viable y hay acuerdo nosotros no tenemos nada que objetar
3036777 en la uni de llauradors consideramos que el acuerdo es una de las primeras condiciones para que se realice un trasvase por lo que hemos propuesto ya que lo contrario no tiene sentido que haya acuerdos de estado para llevar estos temas adelante ya que si no se crea mucha inseguridad entre la poblaci n

3036780 we dont say yes or no to israeli military operations israel is a sovereign country
3036781 we are in very close contact with the israelis and we talk about the diplomatic track that were on
3036782 theyve said that diplomacy can work here and i know theyre doing their part to talk to all of the countries with which they have good relations to explain why its important to have a tough edge to our diplomacy
3036783 were on a diplomatic course and thats the important thing
3036784 i dont know what the iranians would do without the revenue that they receive from selling oil and so the idea that they would somehow deprive the world of iranian oil exports would have to have a pretty devastating effect on iran itself
3036785 can military strikes destroy irans gas centrifuge program probably not
3036786 this analogy is grossly misleading it neglects the important differences between a gas centrifuge uranium enrichment program and a reactor based program and fails to account for the dispersed relatively advanced and hardened nature of irans gas centrifuge facilities
3036787 it also ignores the years iran has had to acquire centrifuge items abroad often illicitly allowing it to create reserve stocks of critical equipment and raw materials
3036788 saakashvili the great democrat is busy charging anyone who opposes him with being a pawn of the russians and therefore guilty of treason but the west is calling on him to restore civil liberties and in an apparent effort to propitiate his western benefactors he has lifted new elections widespread and growing opposition to his strong arm tactics even among many of his former supporters spells political trouble for saakashvili and his corrupt cohorts however and an appeal to georgian ultra nationalism which was always the real ideological motivation of the rose revolutionaries would bolster him in the polls and provide a much needed distraction at least from the ruling partys point of view
3036789 in the event of an outbreak of hostilities expect the u s to do what they have done for the duration of georgias political crisis proffer unconditional support to saakashvili with russia aiding and giving political and diplomatic support to the abkhazians and the ossetians and the americans letting loose a flood of military aid to tbilisi this could be the first theater of actual conflict in the new cold war
3036790 when violence broke out in the caucasus on friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position
3036791 obama accused russia of escalating the crisis through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity

3036794 and this will steam clean your clothes so that they come out looking per fect
3036795 this washer will spin your clothes so fast theyll need a lot less time to dry
3036796 i usually forget the wash overnight and by the next morning the clothes are already half dry
3036797 but these dryers are more energy efficient than the older models and theres this pedestal that you can put them on too so you dont have to bend over so far to load them
3036798 seems like they could have just made them the right height to begin with
3036799 oh these are more energy efficient than the older ones also
3036800 its just that theyre not as efficient as those over there

3036802 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
3036803 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
3036804 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
3036805 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
3036806 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
3036807 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
3036808 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
3036809 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
3036810 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
3036811 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

3036870 xavier nixon loves grapes he said of britts standout offensive lineman
3036871 i aspire to be as strong as him and tough in all areas of life he said
3036872 i knew it drove him crazy to be as uninvolved as he was just going to the games i was happy for him that hes found a way to get a little more satisfaction feeling a part of the team
3036873 he could play linebacker for us but hes sacrificed for the team to play offensive line bailey said

3036886 when they start to change their behaviors and really focus only on that number on the scale only on their weight thats when it gets dangerous everything you do during pregnancy including your diet and exercise should be for your health not for your weight
3036887 calorie restriction is linked with growth retardation and birth defects and with vitamin deficiencies both for the mother and baby whats interesting about vitamin deficiencies is say for instance with calcium deficiency the baby will probably get what he or she needs but thatll be at the expense of the mothers bones so you really have to be careful with that
3036888 from the mothers mental and physical health to better deliveries better postpartum recoveries even a higher i q for the baby
3036889 but you dont want to overdo it you never want to exercise to the point where youre not getting enough oxygen because thats linked with neurological defects in the baby
3036890 you shouldnt exercise to the point of exhaustion if you need to throw yourself on the couch afterwards just to rejuvenate youve done too much you should feel invigorated after your workout not exhausted
3036891 i think weve never before been more kind of obsessed with celebrity culture and with celebrity pregnancies as well its not unusual to see pictures of these celebrities the day before and the day after birth and theyre looking super humanly fit theyre really incredible
3036892 but you also have to remember a lot of these celebrities are just genetically blessed they have the best dieticians nutritionists trainers etc they certainly have an advantage
3036893 orwell is as pertinent to the world now as he ever was
3036894 his incredibly distinctive writing and thinking about political matters his extraordinary decency the internet allows the diaries to be more digestible for the average reader you can find out what he was thinking on a certain date
3036895 i went to the archive and zoomed through the diaries and just wept they show orwell practicing being a writer and an observer you see in the diaries he smells out orthodoxies and presses them until he and the reader are more critical

3036897 i have known since about 1931 stephen spender says he has known since 1929 that the future must be catastrophic i could not say exactly what wars and revolutions would happen but they never surprised me when they came since 1934 i have known war between england and germany was coming and since 1936 i have known it with complete certainty
3036898 it is clear from what american papers one gets hold of that anti british feeling is in full cry and that all the isolationists after a momentary retirement have re emerged with the same slogans as before what always horrifies me about american anti british sentiment is its appalling ignorance ditto presumably with anti american feeling in england

3036923 en ning n caso se puede deducir que el gobierno central le quiera quitar nada a los madrile os
3036924 est a la espera de disponer de los datos de recaudaci n del primer semestre para determinar si se cumplen las condiciones para pagar estos anticipos
3036925 en el caso de que el ministerio de econom a y hacienda adopte finalmente la decisi n de no entregar los anticipos a la comunidad deber a comunicar cu les son los hospitales o centros de salud que en su opini n no deben seguir prestando servicios
3036926 esa cifra los 418 millones equivale al presupuesto que la comunidad dot a la consejer a de justicia en 2007 o a poner en marcha 3 000 camas nuevas en hospitales
3036927 la situaci n de insuficiencia financiera que padec an algunas comunidades en materia sanitaria como consecuencia del espectacular incremento de poblaci n siendo una de las medidas la concesi n de anticipos de tesorer as a las comunidades sobre los recursos del sistema de financiaci n
3036928 estos anticipos no eran un regalo para las comunidades ya que seg n las normas del sistema de financiaci n las entregas a cuenta que las regiones reciben del irpf el iva y los impuestos especiales deben alcanzar el 98 de la recaudaci n sin embargo la pr ctica demostraba que las entregas a cuenta que el estado remit a a las regiones no alcanzaban el 90 o 91 con el consiguiente deterioro financiero de las arcas auton micas mientras el gobierno se lucraba con una cantidad que le correspond a a las comunidades
3036929 se entregaban con regularidad en los meses de julio y se ingresaban en los presupuestos
3036930 ahora por primera vez se ha recibido un escrito del ministerio de econom a y hacienda en el cual se pone en duda que se vayan a entregar los anticipos
3036931 es la responsabilidad que tiene el gobierno de la naci n para quedar bien aunque sea incumpliendo el sistema de financiaci n y los acuerdos de la segunda conferencia de presidente
3036932 y es que no se puede decir a los espa oles que los presupuestos no van a afectar a los servicios esenciales y al mismo tiempo se recorta en la comunidad de madrid en m s de 200 millones la cantidad designada a dependencia y 418 a sanidad
3036933 es que no hemos recibido el dinero sino una cartita pero con ella no se pagan las n minas de m dicos y enfermeras ni los medicamentos de los enfermos esperamos que el gobierno de la naci n cambie y en esa comisi n que este mes de agosto presidir jos luis rodr guez zapatero tome la decisi n de abonarnos los 418 millones de euros
3036934 pone en cuesti n la voluntad del gobierno de la naci n de cumplir con los principios de lealtad institucional y va en contra de no producir recortes en el gasto social de las comunidades aut nomas
3036935 con premeditaci n alevos a y agostismo aprovecha que las comunidades aut nomas supuestamente est n vacaciones para que no reciban las cantidades precisas
3036936 para que el se or zapatero lo pueda tener en el consejo de ministros del jueves donde supongo que evaluar las buenas relaciones entre comillas que tiene con el gobierno de la generalitat y esta zarabanda que se ha montado con las distintas comunidades socialistas en t rminos de sistemas de financiaci n

3037013 its called t wayne the project its basically just going to be an array of things just a visual love the two artists youve seen collaborate with everyone except each other when you see us together its crazy right now we already have what weve done were gonna keep going till they tell us to stop we might even put out a mixtape weve got so many songs that we just might do a yung berg may pose pretty questions to the ladies sexy can i but the rapper seems to be more direct with limo drivers berg was arrested over the weekend for menacing possession of a weapon and possession of marijuana the rapper was in new york and accompanied by four other passengers tmz nore stopped running he kept eating and now he thinks girls like it you know what i can show off my belly too
3037014 i didnt jump in the water and think ill be the hero of the day it was the right thing to do and it was a good result
3037015 ive been rock fishing for years and always wondered what i would do in this type of situation and i didnt think twice looking back on it i would do it again
3037016 i owe my life to him one minute i was fishing and the next thing i knew i was in the water
3037017 the first thing i thought was i dont want to die and then i saw matt
3037018 he hutchison told me to swim away from the rocks and pretend it was a big pool
3037019 luke was struggling to stay above the water because he was pretty cut up

3037022 given the sharp rally in local interest rate markets banks could cut mortgage rates today if they wanted
3037023 after all one of the majors westpac last week reported robust revenue growth of 8 9 per cent anticipated and was on track for 6 8 per cent cash earnings growth for 2008
3037024 other banks will grow their profits despite difficult conditions globally
3037025 a key fact here is that the 90 day bank bill rate has fallen sharply over the past 10 days
3037026 i suspect the major banks will follow any initial 25 basis points rba cut with a 20 25 basis point cut in mortgage rates whereas a 50 basis point rba cut might be followed by a 40 50 basis point cut in mortgage rates
3037027 it wouldnt surprise me to see one of the big four break ranks
3037028 then we might start seeing some competition but its not a foregone conclusion none of them will give an undertaking to pass on the full cut
3037029 i imagine there wouldve been phone calls from higher up given theres big profits coming out
3037030 given the sharp rally in local interest rate markets banks could cut mortgage rates today if they wanted
3037031 i want you to know that i truly love and adore you and im not giving up on us ever
3037032 im so frustrated sad and angry its not funny i am so sick of this valentines is a bit overrated but im engaged and happily in love but im working and looking at happy couples every day it sucks
3037033 i love you and whats the hardest to know is that youre in such a hideous place its just so not fair
3037034 its hard knowing that the man you love is placed in a cell together with murderers
3037035 when did this go so wrong why did this happen
3037036 i guess we just have to hang in there and together well make it through
3037037 no one has told me what i should say or not say
3037038 trying to be strong and positive and put on a brave face
3037039 i hope youre right when you say that everything will be ok

3037041 i was horrified to learn that he hadnt been contacted about the change in arrangements
3037042 ive apologised and weve had a good discussion about that its a very unfortunate set of circumstances
3037043 the advance i believe we have achieved in our discussions today is for us both to agree to the principle of a free trade agreement
3037044 aussie beef is better i am confident in this market australias beef industry will continue to get a fair go
3037045 she is much better compared to when she was in the hospital but she is not 100 per cent stable
3037046 sometimes she cries when she meets or talks with someone close to her especially to her family or to the consulate
3037047 there was obvious signs of violence the motive for the deaths is not known
3037048 they were the most respected people in town i cant see anyone who would want to kill them
3037049 ive just had enough i just want out of here
3037050 is like a major summer blockbuster movie unfolding in my hands
3037051 is arguably the most gripping surprising and satisfying thriller in many decades
3037052 to think after 20 years that i would be returning to transit is almost abstractly absurd
3037053 transit had become my personal holy grail but now with this collected hardcover edition i can roam free of its gaping wailing and allow it to scab over while i move on to new roads
3037054 while shadowline loves to introduce the world to some of the most exciting new talent bringing in someone of teds caliber at such a major capacity is something were equally passionate about we cannot wait to help bring his most personal works to their completion and look forward to more in the future
3037055 neither is it that us foreign policy is cruel because american leaders are cruel its that our leaders are cruel because only those willing to be inordinately cruel and remorseless can hold positions of leadership in the foreign policy establishment it might as well be written into the job description people capable of expressing a full human measure of compassion and empathy toward faraway powerless strangers let alone american soldiers do not become president of the united states or vice president or secretary of state or national security adviser or secretary of the treasury nor do they want to
3037056 if one looks at the credentials of skeptics compared to the credentials of defenders of the official line it is impossible to dismiss skeptics as kooks
3037057 altemeyer prepared a digest of his research for general readers which he has posted online for one and all to examine at no cost
3037058 we believe in liberty and justice for all so of course we oppose many us government policies it means we believe in freedom as more than merely a cliche
3037059 sharon didnt want to do the next series we wanted her to stay on without question but it was totally and utterly her choice
3037060 pay was part of the situation itv wouldnt cough up what she was demanding i think her demands were unreasonable from a financial point of view it was absolutely right to say that there was no more money
3037061 itll be interesting to see how he does its been quite quiet for him
3037062 he had a huge hit with the first single after the final last year but i dont think its reasonable to expect to find a leona every year thats too big an ask
3037063 the press workroom is the largest in olympic history with 971 broadband equipped workstations 680 high speed network connections and an additional 206 for photographers
3037064 im amazed by their skills to see black as white to portray aggressors as victims and blame the real victims for the consequences of the conflict as we all know sadam hussein was hanged for burning down several shiite villages but now the situation is different the georgian leaders who in a matter of hours wiped out south ossetian villages who ran over children and the elderly with tanks who burned civilians alive now those people have to be protected
3037065 both sides are employing brussels based public relations specialists who arranged a succession of conference calls for the international media in recent days with senior government figures striving to put their side of the story across first
3037066 it was very very wet and very very windy conditions were atrocious
3037067 we still had a lot of people turn up to participate which was good and a lot of people were on the streets they turned out regardless
3037068 but i must admit the weather was absolutely awful it couldnt have been worse
3037069 we took 2 250 50p but last year our collection was 6 000 so we were down by half
3037070 in recent years we have managed to breed meerkats sheep fish and now pigs
3037071 it is important that our learners get to study a variety of species first hand and this is the reason for the breeding programme
3037072 they also get to take some animals to county events as part of the courses so hopefully one of these new arrivals will be seen at next years suffolk show
3037073 for the past 10 years we have designed industry niche products to perfectly match flat panel displays
3037074 the leon ethos has always been to give custom installers the versatility to design systems that fit individual needs the profile 404 x a gives the option of not only matching any tv but also wood floors or any wall paint color it not only looks great next to the display but it stands on its own as an incredible two channel solution that customers will want to show off
3037075 a restless desire or craving for something one does not have
3037076 if g d can do it why do we need someone else
3037077 we were aware of it all along but we didnt want to make it too obvious we got a new member of the band on drums ben cole so it was like making our first record again with new influences and new abilities
3037078 with a new person we were able to feed off each other in different ways we had the same ideas but we flipped them around just like you do with an anagram when you have somebody new in the band you can try different ideas that may not have clicked before
3037079 as we embark on our first tour across the united states and canada we are thrilled to announce a cast of exceptionally gifted young actors we are continually amazed and delighted at the breadth of their talent and are excited for audiences coast to coast to have the opportunity to experience such exhilarating performances

3037088 dont vote for that muslim foreign inexperienced colored guy because even if everything youve ever read about me being a monster is true ill only be around for 4 short years
3037089 going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
3037090 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
3037091 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
3037092 if you judge people you have no time to love them
3037093 el hecho de que colombia no haya vuelto a agredir a ecuador ni a sus autoridades es sin duda una expresi n de que la tensi n con el vecino del norte va bajando de tono y eso es importante
3037094 al menos hablar de la posibilidad de que relaciones militares y policiales que es el primer paso que entendemos se debe dar se reanuden se mantengan y que la informaci n que el gobierno de colombia ofreci sea entregada
3037095 un mecanismo bilateral pero en este caso con acompa amiento de la comunidad internacional
3037096 hemos hecho la propuesta de que se cree un mecanismo con observadores internacionales m s o menos permanentes que puedan r pidamente movilizarse e investigar los incidentes y luego producir informes claros para ambas partes
3037097 something simple enough for the athletes to put together yet stylish enough to elevate us as a country
3037098 in questo 11 agosto sentiamo ancora una volta il bisogno cos come dice la nostra costituzione di ribadire il principio che la pace un bene supremo e vogliamo dire che coloro che si sono sacrificati a firenze come in ogni parte ditalia nella lotta di liberazione volevano un futuro di pace
3037099 anche questanno siamo qui e il salone dei cinquecento pieno di gente ha aggiunto il sindaco domenici e per questo prima di tutto voglio ringraziare tutti voi che siete qui con molta riconoscenza perch questo il mio ultimo 11 agosto da sindaco e quindi per me rappresenta qualcosa di particolarmente significativo noi in questi anni abbiamo tenuto vivo il ricordo di questa grande festa cittadina con la partecipazione di tutti voi questo appuntamento anche scomodo perch cade nel mezzo del mese di agosto eppure sono stati tanti 11 agosto partecipati per questo voglio ringraziare i presenti la federazione delle associazioni antifasciste e della resistenza e lassociazione nazionale partigiani ditalia rappresentate da romano ragazzini e alberto cecchi che prenderanno la parola dopo di me un ringraziamento e un saluto particolare ha detto ancora il sindaco domenici al gonfalone della provincia di torino e a piero valenzano consigliere provinciale nipote di quel piero valenzano di cui porta lo stesso nome partigiano della brigata lanciotto ucciso dal fuoco nemico il 15 agosto del 1944 alla stazione di s m novella aveva 20 anni e sognava finita la guerra di lavorare alla fiat quel sogno non si realizzato ma il sacrificio di pierino valenzano insieme a quello di altri che condivisero la sua scelta ha permesso al nostro paese di avere un futuro
3037100 una testimonianza questa ha aggiunto il primo cittadino di cosa rappresent la guerra partigiana la lotta di liberazione negli ideali e nel sacrificio di tanti giovani che scelsero di combattere anche lontani dalla loro terra dalle loro famiglie dai loro affetti contro la dittatura fascista e contro loccupazione tedesca cos come accadde per tanti partigiani fiorentini caduti a torino e in piemonte nomi che non ricorrono frequentemente nelle nostre commemorazioni ma che voglio oggi citare ilario bellini giuliano calosci mario ceseri edoardo dabbene alberto ferri corrado rettori gianfranco sarfatti il loro ricordo il ricordo di una generazione che seppe ridare dignit allitalia la testimonianza perenne di valori ai quali un popolo una comunit non pu rinunciare tra questi valori irrinunciabile e fondamentale il valore della pace oggi di drammatica attualit per una nuova guerra che sta insanguinando il caucaso le vittime ancora una volta soprattutto civili e il rischio che il conflitto degeneri allargandosi in unarea tra le pi critiche del pianeta testimoniano limportanza di non ammainare mai i vessilli della pace e mentre a pechino si sono aperte le olimpiadi e lopinione pubblica mondiale richiede che si rispetti lo spirito di amicizia e di fratellanza che i giochi rappresentano le ragioni del dialogo e della convivenza sembrano nuovamente sconfitte dal fuoco delle armi si faccia sentire alta la voce di chi ha a cuore la pace e ad essa si accompagni lazione decisa e immediata del nostro governo perch reclami dalle nazioni unite e dalleuropa atti ed interventi volti a far cessare i bombardamenti a ripristinare la normalit e a ricondurre il conflitto nei canali della trattativa e del negoziato
3037101 abbiamo celebrato in una cerimonia in palazzo vecchio leccidio di pian dalbero e confererito in quella occasione alle famiglie delle vittime il fiorino doro della citt di firenze abbiamo presenziando a roma davanti allaltare della patria alla consegna delle medaglie doro al valor civile ai cinque giovani renitenti alla leva fucilati al campo di marte il 22 marzo del 1944 ma anche parlato della costituzione alla presenza del capo della stato qui nel salone dei cinquecento quella costituzione che nelle parole di sandro pertini nata dal sacrificio di migliaia e migliaia di caduti che morirono testimoniando gli ideali dellumanesimo democratico calpestati in quella lunga notte della negazione delluomo e rileggendone gli articoli fondamentali nelle lingue dei cittadini stranieri che vivono nella nostra citt per significare limportanza dellaccoglienza e dellintegrazione

3037107 of all the forms of inequality injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane
3037108 that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
3037109 the problem is the number of public companies has shrunk every year for the last eight years
3037110 that means fewer buyers every year it puts more power in the hands of select buyers
3037111 theyre vcs consuming the wealth of the generation of vcs that preceded them that created the companies that are buyers that are in place today and theyre not repopulating the system the ecosystem with more buyers

3037125 in the past i have said three times that im going to retire without knowing what would happen i never thought that in 2008 i would win a gold medal
3037126 i went through a very low period in my life
3037127 as you grow older you are not as strong as you used to be i was under tremendous pressure
3037128 the first olympic gold was for myself today i dedicate this gold medal for my country
3037129 my most important commitment was to win this gold medal
3037130 its difficult to say what will happen in the future because so many things can change i dont think i want to share my plans for the future now
3037131 economic growth is down around the world demand for commodities especially energy continues to slide
3037132 de restricties zijn mijns inziens een voorloper op offici le wetgeving om het ongebreidelde naakt shorten tegen te gaan eind juli werd de looptijd van de maatregelen ook pas verlengd in de laatste uren dat ze nog van kracht waren
3037133 short selling brengt veel risicos met zich mee het is een gevaarlijk spel ik heb het vaak faliekant mis zien gaan bovendien is het alleen voorbehouden aan grote professionele partijen dit is niet eerlijk ten opzichte van de kleinere beleggers die zien alleen maar het resultaat op hun scherm scherp dalende koersen met grote omzetten
3037134 de koersen zijn inderdaad per saldo niet omhoog gegaan maar ik wijt dit aan het zeer chaotische beursklimaat van dit moment er zit veel angst in de markt toch vertoont amerika in zeker opzicht een herstel de belangrijkste indices daar zijn slechts met de helft gedaald in vergelijking met koersen in europa
3037135 aandelen kunnen natuurlijk ook dalen omdat beleggers hun aandelen verkopen of zich inlenen en daarna short gaan
3037136 maar de grote koersdalingen van meer dan 30 in korte tijd hebben we niet meer gezien
3037137 im at a bbq and cant tell if its a hangover or sun poisoning
3037138 judge a man by his questions rather than his answers
3037139 i wanted it to be a show about characters and to really explore what it means to be 170 years old and what it means to fall in love with somebody who basically part of the relationship would involve in a world thats mutually satisfying being fed upon not being able to see this person except at night having the entire town think what are you crazy
3037140 have you not learned that your word shall be bond regardless of whom or what
3037141 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3037142 this flag is a strong and powerful piece of heritage for them to send us something so significant makes me feel very honored
3037143 we are going to respect this flag the same way we would if it was our own piece of history
3037144 each platoon from 2nd bn 14th cav regt will take the flag on a mission with them and when the mission is complete well have the soldiers unfold the flag and together hold it up while a photo is taken
3037145 from the beginning this has been a joint iraqi government coalition forces project from the initial development and planning to the execution to this point where we are getting ready to distribute the water to the local people
3037146 this project the tanks and the distribution point has been funded with iraqi money with the coordination of the baghdad water authority we have been able to develop this site
3037147 it makes me so happy to see people picking up the water i want them to know it is clean water for drinking
3037148 i want to say thanks to both sides coalition and iraqi sides who give water to the people and i am proud to be involved to help give the water to the people around here
3037149 everybody has to make sacrifices but sacrifices always help other people and thats always good
3037150 we dont limit access to those that would defeat the purpose but we watch them to make sure nobody is out there causing problems
3037151 we limit access to the tanks and to the water purification unit
3037152 when it all comes together it is really satisfying to see it all work
3037153 it took a lot of hard work from a lot of important folks army folks and government folks and this is not a small project
3037154 having the opportunity to represent the multi national division baghdad command as a voting assistance officer is an awesome opportunity
3037155 i try my best to ensure that i give a 100 percent effort to any and everybody who comes in my section to ask about voting
3037156 ive had junior soldiers to officers pull me in the hallway or in the dining facility and say hey what do i need to do to vote
3037157 its a simple process but i think one of the biggest challenges that we are going to have here while in theater is just getting the word out
3037158 i think a lot of times people think the process is harder than it is when it really only takes five minutes
3037159 weve signed up about 180 people in the last five weeks
3037160 soldiers are at the core of an organization that protects democracy protects the rights that we believe in
3037161 every person every soldier from the lower enlisted to the highest ranking has a part to play in voting because every issue or every policy every directive that comes down from our higher our commander in chief affects us all
3037162 being able to have an opportunity to at least put a word in edgewise in the form of a vote i think is key and at least allows a soldier to say hey i made a difference i at least voted
3037163 we will have to see what happens at fulham with david now they have signed more strikers
3037164 he will get his head down and carry on working in training and if he gets a chance show what he can do in games
3037165 kyle has moved to a massive club in rangers and got a full 90 minutes in at the weekend
3037166 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified

3037338 recent statutes indicate that the legislature is aware that some parents in california homeschool their children by declaring their homes to be private schools
3037339 would undermine a practice that has been if not actively encouraged at least acknowledged and accepted by officials and the public for many years

3037354 i think our bigger fear was that we didnt want to offend any religious people but looking at the discussion that unfolded from this thing what we had was a good sizeable group of players that we might call militant atheists and the rest of the players seemed very tolerant including all of the religious players
3037355 we have a number of team members that are pretty religious and so in design on the team in our small little microcosm of players out there we tried our best to make sure we werent overtly offending any religious people but yet we wanted to include the idea the concept of religion in the game
3037356 i kind of like the idea of having a range of projects some of them very short term maybe one very long term its nice to have things a little out of cycle
3037357 when you design a massively multiplayer online game you have to bite off a lot of major design limitations like nobody can pause the game nobody can cheat you usually have to pay a subscription
3037358 i think a lot of these limitations were what sank the sims online we didnt have enough user created content to a lot of the people that were playing the sims the idea of paying a subscription was a really big filter a lot didnt even have credit cards
3037359 thats not to say that one day we might not do a massively multiplayer online version of spore but its just not the most interesting initial unveiling of it for me

3037377 we are really seeing an absolutely unparalleled situation since many many decades in the world
3037378 this is the most surreal world crisis i could ever imagine and its very unfortunate that it is happening in my country i insist that its happening unprovoked by us and i insist that it was all pre planned
3037379 we should start 2009 by calling a referendum on whether to approve the states new constitution policy
3037380 if we cant reach substantive agreements then we must address all those issues which divide us to a referendum issues like re election the compatibility of autonomous governments land issues
3037381 in some ways its such a nice change to the regular tour we play in
3037382 i guess when i speak to some players now who didnt play in the olympics in 1996 and 2000 i know some of them have regrets
3037383 i would never want to miss an olympic games ever again if i would have a chance to compete in them
3037384 i think any time those guys have been playing in finals theyve been playing some pretty good tennis
3037385 so it would obviously raise the profile of the final if those two were to meet in the final
3037386 theyve had such a unique rivalry over the last two or three years as well and probably more so right at the moment because raf has started to go on top of roger obviously a lot of people know who those two are even if youre not that big of a tennis fan
3037387 im probably one of the few people who get sleepy at 7 oclock
3037388 i go to sleep really early ive been to the opening ceremonies at sydney and i was in a foul mood by the time 5 oclock came around and it just wasnt worth it after seven hours of standing ive got to preserve my body
3037389 especially after spending an incredible couple of weeks in sydney which to me will always stay in my memory as one of the greatest sports dreams that ive ever had
3037390 i hope that with my presence and also with rafis presence i think thats only going to make it more important for the future generations as well

3037418 grandma called she is really upset she cant get hold of uncle sid
3037419 ive been trying to reach sid all afternoon he was going to mow my lawn and he didnt come and he wont answer the phone and im so scared
3037420 mom hes probably fine you know he sleeps so soundly that he cant hear the phone ring sometimes getting him to pick up and answer when hes sleeping is like trying to raise the dead
3037421 mom calm down hes probably fine but well go see
3037422 bud well have to get the key from mom and find out whats going on inside
3037423 bud how about if we get the key you come back and find out whats what and ill stay with mom and hold her hand to keep her quiet
3037424 bud you cant go back there alone if you enter the house the dog will think you are an intruder and will have you for dinner its a big dog
3037425 mom lets just take it one step at a time and not jump to too many conclusions until we get there
3037426 please god ive never had to deal with anything like this before
3037427 god this doesnt look real awful good please dont let bud get traumatized if he has to scrape sid out of the bathtub or something
3037428 mom this is the plan when we get there and open the door you call the dog
3037429 dont go in the house let bud go in just call the dog out but you stay outside too
3037430 mom i was dead tired i didnt care about answering the phone besides ive got the bell turned off on the bedroom one
3037431 for me it was a shameful thing that i wanted to keep hidden
3037432 let me say clearly that matter is not a priority for me but it is something that i will speak to my colleagues about
3037433 the alrc has failed to demonstrate a breach of privacy by the media is not already dealt with by existing laws such as defamation and surveillance laws or self regulation by the media

3037435 every day i get phone calls from family and friends back in mauritius they have been very supportive
3037436 were looking at video footage from a place up in ballarat but we dont actually think its connected but weve still go to show that to the parents
3037437 its really concerning and very very concerning for the family theyre devastated
3037438 theyre doing the best they can and theyve been offered counselling to help them get through it
3037439 if you see yadav if hes being harboured please call crime stoppers or contact us because it really hasnt changed from yesterday
3037440 weve got more troops on to it now though so were really ramping it up
3037441 its a tragedy and very sad for the family so if we can play some part to help find yadav we will
3037442 every time i take care of my son it reminds me of her

3037487 what we have done is take two very different approaches to the challenge of creating bulk metamaterials that can exhibit negative refraction in optical frequencies
3037488 both bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
3037489 natural materials do not respond to the magnetic field of light but the metamaterial we created here does
3037490 it is the first bulk material that can be described as having optical magnetism so both the electrical and magnetic fields in a light wave move backward in the material
3037491 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
3037492 the magnetic field which oscillates at a perpendicular angle to the electrical field in a light wave is essentially blind to the upright nanowires a feature which significantly reduces energy loss
3037493 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss
3037494 weve also opened up a new approach to developing metamaterials by moving away from previous designs that were based upon the physics of resonance previous metamaterials in the optical range would need to vibrate at certain frequencies to achieve negative refraction leading to strong energy absorption resonance is not a factor in both the nanowire and fishnet metamaterials

3037503 with the cisco network solution weve achieved the holy grail of digital video which is the ability to perform shot selections on low resolution files and extract high resolution material from those files even as they are being recorded that is a huge accomplishment
3037504 cisco is a trusted partner and in the demanding it environment of the olympic games we depend on trusted relationships we have absolute deadlines for when olympics coverage begins and ends cisco technologies help us exceed expectations and meet our timetables in an unforgiving environment
3037505 we are making broadcast history executing the creation management and distribution of digital video in a way thats never been achieved before
3037506 we are entering the visual networking era where video changes everything especially the way people connect with the olympic games the olympics is all about the experience the next best thing to being in beijing is to be able to see the event coverage this year not only are thousands of hours of olympic coverage being transmitted in real time but ciscos ip video network and encoding technologies are also giving people the ability to access hundreds of event videos on demand using their pcs laptops and mobile devices for an unprecedented olympic experience anywhere anyplace anytime

3037508 there is a great wealth of young talent coming through the ranks at wasps and it is a very exciting time for the club as we see our youngsters develop and shape our squad
3037509 hugos move to the senior squad reiterates the fantastic development streams we have in place as rob smith and alun powell continue to produce some of the most exciting players on the domestic and international stage through our academy
3037510 hugo showed growing confidence and maturity last season especially with england u20s and he now has the opportunity to take his development to the next level as part of the 1xv squad
3037511 lachlan is a player who we feel will both benefit from and add to the wasps environment shaun and i have been impressed with footage we have seen of him with sydney university and the waratahs academy and he is another young player who has great potential

3037519 instead they continue to objectify women and children as victims who are powerless in a country that places men on a pedestal

3037522 i think the town board wants to see if we can work out the issues with the new owners before it gets to court

3037532 of course i do get approached from the other athletes to get asked for the picture
3037533 you know tennis is played 10 months out of 12 in the year at least so they see a lot of us on the tv obviously
3037534 im being surrounded with the best athletes around the world its a privilege
3037535 we saw this when we arrived but at no time did anyone approach us nor did we sign anything like this we dont even know who that group is
3037536 theyve probably done it with him and other athletes its not surprising they put the names of famous athletes
3037537 as far as i know we do have his signature and he did express interest and his support of the campaign
3037538 however if he wishes to withdraw he can obviously do so

3037547 further to discussions with the department of foreign affairs who are currently advising against non essential travel to georgia the fai has today written to fifa uefa and the georgian fa to indicate that its preferred option would be to find an alternative venue on the same date for the group 8 world cup qualifier against georgia in tbilisi

3037557 seems like they could have just made them the right height to begin with
3037558 oh these are more energy efficient than the older ones also
3037559 its just that theyre not as efficient as those over there

3037578 he said he needed money to buy food i told him there was a dining hall where he could eat for free he said it was too far of a walk and i told him it wasnt
3037579 it has helped remind me the emotions that parents go through in this situation because that freshman is their baby
3037580 i had an idea about it remembering how it was for me going off to college but its different living through it as a parent
3037581 jon said he couldnt come home for the weekend that he didnt have any gas money
3037582 i didnt get any money for a good 10 days then my parents had some heart and helped me out
3037583 but i know they were just helping me to learn to be my own man its all for my own good
3037584 mark just said was so proud of the young man jon had become he was excited about his future and said that jon was going to do a lot of great things in life for the lord and bless a lot of people
3037585 he was disappointed he couldnt go i wasnt in the room when they talked but marks eyes were red and jon teared up pretty good too but not as much because he was so excited about going off to college
3037586 i told him no matter what happens to keep chopping wood
3037587 college football is a grind lots ups and downs dont ever get discouraged to the point where you want to quit because i know all freshmen go through rough times tying to fit in
3037588 on this day of your life dear friend i believe god wants you to know that the most dramatic conflicts are perhaps those that take place not between men but between a man and himself author mark moustakas said that and he was right if we can win the struggle within the struggle that muslims call jihad we can win this human race what are you battling with right now what unwanted habit what undesireable behavior what old pattern claim victory over these and your entire life can change you will not have to think but a second to know exactly why you received this message today

3037593 vendors need to name their products theres no question about that and theres unfortunately product specific taxonomy but broad terms like cloud computing those are canvasses that we should all be able to paint our piece of the mural on
3037594 the application was to protect the use of the term cloud computing as it relates specifically to our offering
3037595 at the time when we announced our solution it was not quite as pervasive a term we sought to protect our intellectual property and we certainly respect the intellectual property of other people and would not infringe on that of others

3037603 i was frightened about the diagnosis i was confused to some extent about what was going to be expected of me because i knew i had several stops along the way before i actually got into surgery
3037604 we made an immediate connection her name was carol ann and my name was carol ann
3037605 if you can make that connection with somebody then they feel like they have maybe a friend whos there with them whos really going to be her to help to get things done on time get to point a point b without any problems
3037606 her freedom with questions and answers her general comfort and confidence did a lot to bring me into the surgery with a positive spirit i had to have
3037607 its nice its i mean its as comfortable as a presurgical experience can be
3037608 for many women having surgery on their breasts is a very troubling scary and life altering experience carol really brought me around the bend to where i could walk into that operating room with confidence that this was the right thing for me to do at this time
3037609 a joint enterprise is where all of those people involved in an incident such as a murder would all be held responsible for the outcome of that

3037625 it created a community that had experience of using home computers very early on
3037626 they very quickly got fed up with the games that were available they were pretty primitive but there were games available from magazines that could be typed in
3037627 the internet didnt exist but you had an exchange of activity among these kids and soon they started writing their own games
3037628 it needs the media the players everyone just to help push the message that scotland is a world leader in making games
3037629 to sustain that reputation we need to keep attracting talent to make the games and we need to get people excited about the industry
3037630 theres a lot we need to be careful about as the cost of making games is going through the roof

3037683 service is the very purpose of life it is the rent we pay for living on the planet
3037684 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3037685 the question in peoples minds is how unbiased can google be as it grows and grows and grows
3037686 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3037687 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3037688 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3037689 we raised enough money 22 million to get to that point through experimentation
3037690 only in the tech business are companies born with neither a clear reason for being nor a clue as to how theyll produce profits
3037691 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3037692 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3037693 i still dont know what i did wrong before my last round i did the exact same preparation i probably started trying too hard
3037694 recently we came across a rather unfortunate exploit case for the access snapshot viewer activex vulnerability that took advantage of a property of the activex system to exploit ie users who did not have the vulnerable control installed how does one exploit a vulnerability that does not exist on a system you say sadly attackers have found a way to install the vulnerable access snapshot viewer activex control through internet explorer prior to exploiting it
3037695 once this vulnerable control is installed on the victims computer it is exploited in the same way as if the control was installed all along to top it off this attack is carried out as a drive by attack so the unprotected user may never know that they were vulnerable or had been targeted let alone infected
3037696 the challenging economic environment continues however we are pleased with our disciplined approach to margin expense and capital management
3037697 the research funded by the us government could one day be used in military stealth operations with tanks made to disappear from the enemies sight
3037698 we do not see any reason to panic the areas crime rate has decreased we view this as an isolated incident and we see no reason for increased patrols all we can do is urge motorists to be careful
3037699 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3037700 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3037708 those who have had the honour of knowing master cpl roberts describe him as the embodiment of a brother in the truest sense of the world
3037709 truth honour and loyalty were not mere words to josh but the unspoken creed which he lived his life by
3037710 sadly the sun has set on the life of another true canadian son dear friend and soldier let us never forget his sacrifice
3037711 josh was a soldier he had always wanted to be a soldier and he loved what he did
3037712 he felt strongly in what he was doing and the family is hopeful canadians will understand and appreciate the sacrifice josh has made for all canadians and the sacrifice of all families of military personnel serving in afghanistan
3037713 hes the kind of guy we would describe as a soldiers soldier and i know thats a coined phrase but in actual fact he was one of those real guys
3037714 always carrying his share and more and always looking out for his buddies and comrades any which way quite often they may not have realized it but he was looking after them one way or another

3037727 its really important that all the younger players at everton see there are opportunities for them that there is a way to go
3037728 even the lads younger than these can see the jack rodwells and the dan goslings getting a chance in the first team its great motivation for them
3037729 the chairman and the manager are trying very hard to bring in players and hopefully well see something materialise in the next week or two to support these young lads

3037788 as a whole five teams broke the world record we broke the world record by four seconds and won by nine one hundredths of a second so it was a pretty intense race a pretty fun race and i was glad to be a part of it

3037790 i dont even know how to describe how amazing it was

3037822 one of the highest priority tasks to avoid contamination of the human food chain with bovine spongiform encephalopathy
3037823 no currently available method enables the real time detection of possible central nervous system cns tissue contamination on carcasses during slaughter
3037824 small quantities of bovine spinal cord were reliably detected in the presence of raw bovine skeletal muscle fat and vertebrae the research lays the foundation for development of a prototype device allowing real time monitoring of cns tissue contamination on bovine carcasses and meat cuts
3037825 our detector actually flew to the edge of outer space and then back to ground and the whole time it worked perfectly
3037826 the purpose of the grant is not only to develop instrumentation for use in space flight but also to promote student interest in science and engineering through experiments with high altitude balloons
3037827 the best part about the project is that the detector was built from everyday materials and launched into near space from right here in our own backyard this proves you can accomplish really amazing things with simple materials
3037828 while many have thought that people wont be able to take medicines as well as they need to due to limited resources in poor countries our review of all studies on the topic strongly suggests that children in low income countries are able to maintain at least a comparable degree of art adherence if not better adherence than children in high income countries
3037829 healthcare systems need to carefully monitor how children with hiv take their medicines this kind of monitoring can be particularly difficult in low income countries so its very helpful for healthcare providers to understand how others do this monitoring and how well its working
3037830 we were not completely surprised to find the high rate of adherence to art in children in low income countries because it mirrors the results of adult studies but there is no question that it is reassuring to learn that even in settings where families face many challenges children are still able to adhere to a demanding yet essential medication regimen
3037831 our efforts to increase access to art must be coupled with research to inform strategies to deliver that therapy
3037832 what is surprising is that such effects may pop up seventy or eighty years after birth

3037841 jack worked for us for a while back maybe ten years ago now great mind solved more cases in the few months he worked here than we usually solve in a year but he couldnt settle something kept pulling him back to cardiff something about a doctor i wondered if he was sick but ive never seen a healthier looking man in my life anyway we kept in touch help each other out when we can
3037842 penny wont buy you anything these days not even my thoughts mate
3037843 its not a major oil producer but there are major transport links to europe through that region
3037844 the company could declare force majeure on its exports from the two ports
3037845 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3037846 losses have been pretty sharp in the last few weeks and theres always someone looking to buy on the dip
3037847 hideki matsui has been unable to return from swelling in his left knee since june 23 and right handed starter chien ming wang was lost for the season a week earlier with a partially torn tendon in his right foot wang totaled 19 victories for the yankees in 2007 catcher jorge posada nursed a sore right shoulder for most of the season before opting for surgery july 30 that ended his season
3037848 with chamberlains return uncertain the yankees must plug three holes in the rotation and hope they get better offensive production to offset what could be a tough stretch
3037849 hideki matsui has been unable to return from swelling in his left knee since june 23 and right handed starter chien ming wang was lost for the season a week earlier with a partially torn tendon in his right foot wang totaled 19 victories for the yankees in 2007 catcher jorge posada nursed a sore right shoulder for most of the season before opting for surgery july 30 that ended his season
3037850 with chamberlains return uncertain the yankees must plug three holes in the rotation and hope they get better offensive production to offset what could be a tough stretch
3037851 we can do much better and we should do much better
3037852 we are going to increase our focus on all the things that determine how we make ayp
3037853 five schools that did not make ayp this year is unacceptable
3037854 we will be taking a stronger look at a lot of areas across the board academically
3037855 with this we will be able to identify individual needs of each student and provide concentrated help where it is needed most
3037856 i firmly believe you have to accept the fact that you do have a problem and then find a way to fix it
3037857 theres no way in hell i can stay up that late
3037858 shared a rigatoni with meat sauce with tom then had our cod with pancetta which comes with mashed potato
3037859 when i saw my boobs i was disappointed because they looked big and i wanted them a lot smaller they hang too low when im standing up and its really bad when im lying down
3037860 the french italians and chinese have hundreds of years of food history and culture built on strong foundations and i respect that
3037861 anyone can join if they share the cira philosophy are prepared to work tirelessly to promote it and are not in it for self promotion
3037862 i would say you should never change an original recipe
3037863 for example carpaccio is a classic venetian dish and should only be called carpaccio in its traditional form
3037864 carpaccio does not just mean raw or thinly sliced which is how many chefs interpret it
3037865 raw swordfish is a lovely dish but it should be called crudo di pesce not carpaccio
3037866 you should always respect the classic dish by all means create a new recipe but call it by a new name
3037867 for us food is not only a culture it is a religion
3037868 you need to know how to cook a dish like your grandmother and then a good chef will use the local products where you are
3037869 the young chaps from tafe will come to understand what real italian cooking is like
3037870 its main purpose is to promote understanding of the tastes of thai cuisine
3037871 fusion is ok we encourage creativity but the ingredients must be the same as the original thai recipe
3037872 may adapt their styles of dish by changing some ingredients
3037873 major ingredients which are tamarind juice and palm sugar should remain
3037874 in general in australia we are very satisfied with the ingredients available locally most thai vegetables are grown in darwin but our thai grocery stores are important to supply imported foods
3037875 if we use a californian grown japanese variety rice is that not authentic hijiki is a traditional seaweed that comes dry and you reconstitute it and eat it as a vegetable in australia we cannot import it the toro bluefin tuna in australia is a different variety to japan it simply tastes different is that not authentic
3037876 that simplicity of japanese food is something i recognise and i like that but ive got nothing against someone using a japanese technique and modifying a dish in certain ways
3037877 dad was really into led zeppelin but i always preferred the melodies of the 50s and 60s
3037878 when i tell me friends i am doing a buddy holly musical they say whos that
3037879 i thought it looked fresh and young and we are a fresh young country
3037880 i thought it was perhaps a degree too casual i would have liked to see it a bit more formal particularly after seeing the french and italians look so slick
3037881 i thought it was quite fresh it gave a contemporary edge to australias representatives at the olympics
3037882 i thought it was terribly inappropriate for the occasion i thought it was a great piece of design perfect for around the pool or around the track but in terms of trying to convey an image of australia as a creative innovative and culturally chic nation i think it fell short
3037883 nicole kidman 41 and her country music star husband keith urban 40 took togetherness to a whole new level on saturday by wearing matching outfits to a soccer match in sydney
3037884 the couple sported his n hers black zip up leather jackets black shirts dark jeans and baseball caps to the sydney swans game near identical sunglasses capped off the ensembles
3037885 man soll aufh ren wenn es am sch nsten ist
3037886 you know seeing it having it in your head all the time feeling the world turning timey wimey stuff
3037887 oh now youll be giving me that look arent you dont really it sounds stupid but its true i cant describe it not in a way youd understand
3037888 just that it all gets lost in translation really it gets lost when you try and pin it down into words like catching mist and sparkles of light
3037889 it cant be done theres no words in your language to translate it into i described it as well as i could and even that doesnt really begin to capture it if i tried to translate it you dont have words for the concepts involved its like snow people who live in the desert where its hot year round and rarely rains they dont have a word for snow they cant understand it not right its like smells or tastes or sounds you humans dont have many words to describe smells things smell nice or bad or strange but you havent got words to describe smells really
3037890 like trying to describe the taste of chocolate to someone whos never eaten it
3037891 now me i could describe chocolate to you but not in english you wouldnt understand the words i could teach you the words if you liked but you couldnt use them to describe things to anyone else because they dont know the words its the same thing i could teach you the words but unless you experienced it they would be meaningless
3037892 so different alien im still not used to it even now after two years
3037893 you know how you can take a pencil and draw a line on a piece of paper and that line is one dimensional
3037894 well actually its not but its as close as you can get right length but no width supposedly
3037895 so then you can draw more lines make it a triangle or a square or a pentagon whatever
3037896 then its two dimensional and you can take more paper tape it all together make it like everything we see around us three dimensional and that is what we see three dimensions but theres dimensions you cant see beyond a line and a square and a cube arent there theres the fourth dimension and thats time even though you cant see it its there anyways time change evolution whatever you call it i like change personally if it changes its four dimensional now you can pick a point on the line or a piece of that square and if you fill the cube with little cubes you can pick a little cube cant you well im a time lord and i can pick a line or a square or a cube and i can pick a time in the fourth dimension
3037897 youre all stiff and er your heartbeats are tickling me
3037898 it just tickles its kind of nice in a funny er tickley way
3037899 you know how we were saying about concepts that theres no words for and things being lost in translation
3037900 well why dont we make our own little concept language you know we both taste the same thing then one of us comes up with words to describe it or do the same thing or whatever but we cant contradict each others words
3037901 it would be very tough to convince religious people that the novel isnt pretending to be the correct history
3037902 zaidans book seeks to persuade readers that the azazel story is true and was found in ancient scrolls written in syrianic and aramiyan languages
3037903 the author tries to islamise christian beliefs and takes the side of heretics

3037940 the extremely strong crop price environment should translate into continued robust demand for fertilizers we expect potash fertilizer market fundamentals to remain strong through 2014 given limited new capacity additions and growing demand
3037941 while natural gas and sulfur costs do provide some headwinds in the near term price increases should more than offset cost increases
3037942 as a result of these strong gains and the expectation of continued high demand the company again raised its earnings forecast for the full year this time to 12 13 per share for the third quarter net income is expected to be in the range of 3 25 3 75 per share
3037943 looking ahead we can expect more of the same demand for fertilizer nutrients remains strong china recently settled its 2008 potash contract prices at us 400 a metric ton higher than the 2007 levels
3037944 of course potash is an international commodity and we could see a price correction however the world food shortage is a real and growing threat everything points to continuing strength in the potash markets for the foreseeable future as countries ramp up food production
3037945 pots management is certainly confident the company recently announced large expansions at its allan cory and rocanville mines all scheduled for completion in 2012 given the outlook and rapidly rising earnings i think that potash has a lot of upside potential despite these difficult markets
3037946 the price drop has brought potash back into buying territory even an extremely conservative 12 5 multiple on forecasted earnings of about 22 a share in 2009 would provide an upside target of 275

3037958 over the past six months pilgrims pride has taken a number of proactive steps to strengthen our competitive position amid a very difficult operating environment
3037959 these steps include the production cutbacks for the second half of fiscal 2008 the closure of a plant in north carolina and seven distribution centers and the consolidation of our tray pack operations in el dorado ark
3037960 with labor day approaching and no indication that the actions taken to date by pilgrims pride or other industry members are having a positive effect on selling prices for our products it is now clear that more significant decisive action is necessary
3037961 in addition epas disappointing decision to reject the request for a partial waiver of the 2008 renewable fuel standard for corn based ethanol assures that high grain prices are here to stay for the foreseeable future
3037962 while we had sincerely hoped to avoid further facility closures or consolidations we recognize that we must do everything in our control to pass along higher input costs we believe the actions announced today while painful are needed to position pilgrims pride to emerge from this down cycle as a much stronger more efficient competitor

3037991 obviously the job advertisements are down but it still hasnt deteriorated significantly
3037992 the reason for that is employers still know they have to keep good talent for when it the market bounces back
3037993 i dont think that there is going to be mass retrenchments but there will be very limited hiring and the same thing applies to contractors
3037994 this is probably the first sign we have seen of the new media softening
3037995 although there are things making their way through the system such as tax cuts and oil pricing not getting any worse i still think the global financial jitters will continue to hurt all australian employers

3037997 with the new financial year now in swing this could be worrying signs for the it market in australia
3037998 however it could also point to differing methods of recruitment and less reliance by organisations on traditional internet job boards for finding people

3038017 a cell phone is with the person who controls it and most parents dont check cell phones

3038106 im having trouble adjusting to it one minute im not pushing hard enough and the next im overdriving whereas sebastian is better at adapting to it
3038107 i have found several small things which helped me to understand the car better even if i am still not totally at ease with it but it is getting better little by little
3038108 i somewhat regret the time ive spent looking for grand ideas on how to adapt the car to my driving style
3038109 now im concentrating on a few details im taking small steps and it seems to be paying off its still complicated but thats just how it is

3038120 its not political correctness he and they are against but the perversion of liberalism
3038121 i have also reached the same conclusion i want to establish a debate around the facts but we are not allowed to do that nowadays all in the name of political correctness
3038122 he accepts the liberation of women and the campaigns for racial and homosexual equality how could he do anything else when there are more gays in the london tory party than old compton street
3038123 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3038124 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3038125 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3038126 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3038127 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3038128 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3038129 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3038130 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3038131 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3038132 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3038133 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3038134 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3038135 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3038136 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3038137 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3038138 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3038139 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3038140 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3038141 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3038142 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3038143 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3038144 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3038145 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3038146 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3038147 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3038148 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3038149 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3038150 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3038151 the repatriation efforts have not stopped deaths theres not even a decrease in deaths
3038152 this continues to be this deadly exorbitantly costly shell game
3038153 we could be not taking into account that it reaches temperatures of 120 degrees 49 celsius or higher
3038154 but we do because we recognize that there are human beings involved in this process and its critical we take care of them
3038155 thats 3 600 individuals who we know are not subject to extreme heat in the desert to traffickers and smugglers who dont have their safety in mind
3038156 it saves the taxpayers money and addresses a very critical life safety issue for individuals who are out in the desert in these very dangerous months
3038157 but be assured that every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up
3038158 since iheukwumere built that house there had been fears of demonic possession of the building which had made it impossible for him and his family to fully reside in the place nobody is sure but that is what majority of people of this community will tell you only god knows the truth since the man iheukwumere never consulted anybody on his predicament before embarking on the spiritual exercise you know that he is a pastor at deeper life and so he must have believed in using spiritual process to tackle his problems but it is unfortunate the whole thing ended like this
3038159 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3038160 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3038161 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3038162 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3038163 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3038164 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3038165 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3038166 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3038167 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3038168 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3038169 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3038170 who are open to doing something on the production side
3038171 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3038172 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3038173 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3038174 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3038175 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3038176 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3038177 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3038178 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3038179 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3038180 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3038181 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3038182 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3038183 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3038184 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3038185 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3038186 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3038187 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3038188 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3038189 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3038190 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3038191 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3038192 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3038193 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3038194 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3038195 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3038196 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3038197 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3038198 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3038199 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3038200 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3038201 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3038202 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3038203 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3038204 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3038205 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3038206 we are getting a number of customer complaints that the application keeps crashing their systems have you looked at the database queries that are running you know the database is our achilles heel man we cant support all that many simultaneous queries maybe we should trying queuing up the queries so they dont overload the system yes i know if we do that it will take longer for things to run but better they run then crash all the time right you know table joins may be a problem too the database just cant handle queries that require table joins maybe the queries we are running are just too big i dont know man weve got to do something soon to fix this ok try some stuff amp get back with me ive got to tell our customers something
3038207 the americans were going to smash them thats what we came here for
3038208 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3038209 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3038210 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3038211 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3038212 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america

3038281 comparing like schools with like schools to measure differences in school results
3038282 were not talking about anything as simplistic and silly as league tables
3038283 but we are talking about parents and the community understanding what kinds of students are in schools their socio economic status the number of indigenous students the number of students with disabilities because that obviously means the schools have special needs
3038284 the aim should be to robustly ascertain what mix of capacities and needs children are bringing to their school
3038285 we need this information in order to understand what schools in turn should offer to these students and how governments and communities working together can support schools to do so
3038286 as a nation we should then be tracking attainment knowing that we are in the powerful position of comparing like schools with like schools if two schools have comparable school populations but widely varying results we would be able to ask the question why and ascertain the answer
3038287 we should be able to identify best practice and innovation and work systematically to ensure that they are spread more widely we should be able to especially assist those schools that need it specifically we should be identifying excellent teaching and excellent school leadership we must expect high standards of every child
3038288 there is considerable concern with proposals to excessively tag students and schools with various labels for little purpose
3038289 nsw is responsible for the welfare and education of its students and is committed to the constructive application of the outcomes of assessment in all its forms
3038290 its like hospitals its the rules around that ranking because if youre going to stand in a hospital and its a similar example with schools like westmead and compare it for example with a small district hospital like canterbury and then attempt in some way from the straight statistics that appear on that list to rank those two hospitals you would not be comparing like with like
3038291 public schools nationwide require an immediate 1 4 billion per annum to raise retention rates to 90 per cent and a further 1 3 billion per annum to ensure that all primary school age children reach the minimum benchmark scores for literacy and numeracy
3038292 such a law would simply allow rich people to employ lawyers in a bid to avoid scrutiny of their wrongdoing
3038293 that matter is not a priority for me but it is something that i will speak to my cabinet colleagues about
3038294 there is no issue its people not zipping the suit up correctly not the suit
3038295 you have to make sure the teeth of the zipper knit together correctly it just needs to be zipped correctly
3038296 i had a bit of a hard time in marshalling
3038297 the suit wouldnt zip up i had to get changed into an old suit im just running on a bit of stress and adrenaline at the moment its all catching up with me
3038298 if someone had gone off and done an intensive month of weights training then we might recommend they be remeasured on the chance their shape has changed
3038299 or if they had gone on a new nutritional regime and dropped a lot of weight we might say the same thing but otherwise there wouldnt be any need to refit them body shape isnt something that changes day to day in a way that would necessitate a readjustment of a suit
3038300 we have worked very closely with the australian team in developing these suits which we launched in march
3038301 we have worked with jessicah schipper for many years in measuring and getting her suit right we have had dozens of people working with them to make sure the fits are just right and are on hand at the pool to offer the athletes any assistance they might need
3038302 we provide very detailed information to the athletes on how to get into the suits
3038303 we even give them an instructional video on how to do it weve tried to cover all the bases
3038304 ive been taking my pets to campus for many many years
3038305 id really like to see her theres never been a reaction like this before
3038306 money is important in life it does not give you happiness we all know but it sure calms the nerves
3038307 we must instead follow the example of the lord who was a lord of mercy very open with sinners
3038308 making oneself available to the lord in the completeness of ones being and therefore totally available to men
3038309 all great works of art are an epiphany of god
3038310 always be ready to give an explanation to anyone who asks you for a reason for your hope
3038311 the earth is waiting for men who will care for it as the work of the creator
3038312 my religion has always been more important than my career i go to mass every day i have no intention of betraying my faith id be too ashamed to show up on the other side in front of side in front of god
3038313 i dont know why we would stop prayers are what we have thats most precious to subject ourselves to the whim of some people very few of them just two is to kneel down rapidly and we dont have the intention to stop
3038314 i pray for mr simoneau to reflect a little on what he is doing i also pray for christian joncas and im convinced that it has helped
3038315 in a democratic system it is the majority that imposes its law i am in politics and a politician who rules his case in the elections i will not fold for one individual
3038316 to ensure the triumph of justice we pay a fortune we are building a brand new prison at roberval new courthouse across quebec why religion is less important why should we be shocked so far this issue did not cost a penny to the municipality i have always defended alone
3038317 you could see it in china or russia not here it is currently exceeding the limits with that case
3038318 he was like a leprechaun he said if i took him home he would grant my wish
3038319 i have used different employment agencies and found mccall to definitely be the best so far
3038320 out of all of the places ive worked for the job shop the place i loved the most was the job shop
3038321 i only want to work from 1 5pm wed fri and all day saturday
3038322 its not about how much money you will spend but how much money i will save you
3038323 we just started looking and you are the 2nd store we have been to
3038324 searching for those who do not wish to be found
3038325 hes busy with his customer now can i help you
3038326 cant see a difference between the two then why pay the higher amount
3038327 theoretically there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing 100 of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed
3038328 i do not see why the government cannot tax those who have more and syphon some of these revenues into savings which can be utilized in investment for future development
3038329 but i often wonder if my husbands colleagues arent slightly jealous that he has a wife who devotes herself to his happiness how many men these days can really say that
3038330 olivers woofing theorem states in a nutshell that in any given athletic competition team individual amatuer professional the team player who is the most over hyped over praised by him her its fans supporters is likely to lose the competition

3038334 at oral argument duke with a candor perhaps more attributable to good legal strategy than to institutional modesty persuasively asserted that this is a threshold that could not be any lower
3038335 dukes argument on this point cannot be reasonably disputed by louisville
3038336 grand theft auto would be super interesting for me and i think i would actually be the right guy to do it because my movies are all bloody and violent and i dont have a problem with action scenes
3038337 the fact is that the abuses occurred on bills watch and as such he will always be a symbol of a broken system
3038338 josh shapiro is one of the brightest young minds in the legislature and has established himself as a leader in the call for reform in harrisburg
3038339 he is a shining example of what every legislator ought to be
3038340 it shows he would have been a very difficult candidate to beat
3038341 he and i may not agree on substantive issues but theres no question about his integrity and his work ethic
3038342 i think were really coming up on a critical time in harrisburg in that we really need to have self examination and study whether the system is really working for the citizens of pennsylvania the 12 and a half million people that depend on us
3038343 we need to continue our efforts on reform but more than any single bill or proposal i think we really need just a fundamental attitude shift a fundamental change in the way business is done there
3038344 that one day really transformed my life and help set me on a path toward politics
3038345 i thought maybe id be there for a year or something but one year turned into nine years
3038346 one day when i was walking joe hoeffel to the house floor kind of whispering in his ear about a vote he was about to cast i realized that as much as i care for joe and respect joe i was tired of whispering in his ear
3038347 i wanted to get out and shout from the rooftops what it is that i believed in
3038348 i felt it was just the wrong thing to do
3038349 if we were going to have a pay increase that decision should be subject to some public hearings or a commissioner or a committee or something it shouldnt be done at 2 oclock in the morning and it shouldnt be done without any public input
3038350 certainly anytime you have the governor breathing down your neck asking lots of questions that keeps you on your toes
3038351 i think when there is a vacuum in leadership you have to step up and offer leadership whether you have a title or not
3038352 this state needs a strong republican party were becoming like democratic new york where we wont matter in a presidential election
3038353 just because life is tough out there you shouldnt rid yourself of competition
3038354 neither is the current economic slowdown a justification for waiving through any application
3038355 the job of the regulators is to assess the long term impact of the alliance on competition not to provide special protection from the immediate challenges of the economic cycle with which every other airline has to deal with
3038356 i think its important to keep at least a daily flight on all the major routes
3038357 so i think as far as virgin atlantic is concerned we feel that we can get the load factors that we need to keep the airline profitable
3038358 shit the last time i looked it was 2 25 i cant sleep im so excited i feel like a kid on christmas eve
3038359 the phillies shit they got a ton of guys who can take over a game in late innings itll be even easier giving up a lead to the phillies than it was to the giants
3038360 its hard to go out there and just lose the games in the manner in which weve done so and its doubly hard losing those games to the giants who are an awful awful dreadful team have you seen their record its worse than ours is somehow
3038361 these guys had to work hard to give the game away and the credit is all theirs
3038362 they tell you that the national league is different from the american league but even still thats a bit of an understatement in the al we actually try to win games and you know you want to be in first place not here man not here
3038363 oh yeah giving up four runs in the seventh is the easiest way to hand the game over to the opposing team some guys like to be fancy and do it on the last out of the game not me i like to get my shit over with so that i can head to the clubhouse and grab a beer satisfied that i did my job
3038364 were forced to keep their kids off the streets so that they would not be exposed to these lesbians carrying obscene signs
3038365 it didnt appear that accelerants were used to ignite the fire
3038366 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
3038367 i think halo is pretty cool guy he kills aliens and doesnt afraid of anything
3038368 hi allison its chris i need you to call me back and i need you to call me back today
3038369 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3038370 atleast i go out and interact with other people outside of my family
3038371 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3038372 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you

3038423 we have seen the crown prosecution service take a very robust approach on this and they have secured convictions on quite a few cases particularly in respect of knife crime where people have been murdered

3038440 the trouble with many plans is that they are based on the way things are now to be successful your personal plan must focus on what you want not what you have

3038444 vendors need to name their products theres no question about that and theres unfortunately product specific taxonomy but broad terms like cloud computing those are canvasses that we should all be able to paint our piece of the mural on
3038445 the application was to protect the use of the term cloud computing as it relates specifically to our offering
3038446 at the time when we announced our solution it was not quite as pervasive a term we sought to protect our intellectual property and we certainly respect the intellectual property of other people and would not infringe on that of others

3038454 because of the known archaeological richness of the area these works were required under planning conditions put in place when the go ahead was given for the runway project at the airport
3038455 construction areas have been stripped of topsoil and checked for archaeological remains before being handed over to balfour beatty
3038456 in total weve checked and signed off a massive area of ground equivalent to about 20 football pitches
3038457 i understand that no archaeological project of this scale and complexity has ever been undertaken on the island before in the course of a major construction contract

3038459 general strikes shut down the normal operations of a city state or nation for a period of time these strikes aim to force action on a single issue or broader set of concerns the reason for this shutdown is not to hurt this country in any way shape or form but is in fact a peaceful method of sending a message to washington d c
3038460 the general strike is a national call to action from citizens to other citizens its not about a single issue it is not an anti war protest a gas price protest a civil rights protest and election fraud protest it is not about torture surveillance corporate media or the environment this strike is about all these issues and more

3038462 all tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent

3038469 i think this is an incredibly efficient actually a scarily efficient way of organizing society thats actually being celebrated here which is a hybrid of some of the worst elements of authoritarian communism mass surveillance of the population total lack of civil liberties lack of a free press lack of democratic rights authoritarian central planning all harnessed not to advance the goals of social justice even in name although there may be some lip service still paid to that but to advance the goals of global capitalism so it is stalinism meets global capitalism there are 100 000 security officers just on olympic duty and to put that into perspective the stadium itself the birds nest stadium holds 90 000 so theres 90 000 spectators and 100 000 secret police keeping control of things in beijing so this is an incredible operation but when you hear people like lou dobbs and other commentators talking about the problems in china its always red china communist china or the chi coms and its really this blast from the past of you know its almost as if the cold war never ended

3038477 an unremitting interest in the personality behind the utterance suggests that the utterance has in some way broken down
3038478 the myth of kafkas life so overshadows what he wrote that millions who have never read a word of his know or think they know something about the middle european nostradamus almost unknown in his own lifetime trapped in a dead end job whose mysterious endlessly interpretable works somehow foresaw the holocaust and so on

3038481 habitualization devours works clothes furniture ones wife and the fear of war and art exists that one may recover the sensation of life it exists to make one feel things to make the stone stony the purpose of art is to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as they are known the technique of art is to make objects unfamiliar to make forms difficult to increase the difficulty and length of perception because the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be prolonged art is a way of experiencing the artfulness of an object the object is not important

3038483 to crack a nut is truly no feat so no one would ever dare to collect an audience in order to entertain it with nut cracking but if all the same one does do that and succeeds in entertaining the public then it cannot be a matter of simple nut cracking or it is a matter of nut cracking but it turns out that we have overlooked the art of cracking nuts because we were too skilled in it and that this newcomer to it first shows us its real nature even finding it useful in making his effects to be rather less expert in nut cracking than most of us
3038484 something of our poor brief childhood is in it something of lost happiness that can never be found again but also something of active daily life of its small gaieties unaccountable and yet springing up and not to be obliterated

3038526 back to school fair has fallen victim to budget limitations some 20 000 worth of supplies were provided to children from low income families at the event and now they will have to turn elsewhere for help

3038533 we are simply overwhelmed with the gratitude and the outpouring of sympathy and well wishes from all over the world the calls and e mails were receiving are from peoples hearts and they speak so well of this extraordinary man
3038534 certainly a steady hand and a calm hand at the wheel at all time
3038535 i can only offer the deepest shock and sorrow we all feel here because the bachman family was always so close to our program

3038545 it will focus on the divisions within the democrat party which frankly is ok with me

3038629 will you help me to trust you will you help me to wait on you and oh my word honor you and obey you no matter how insane our life is right now will you teach me moment by moment as i walk through all of these trials all this difficulty all this uncertainty will you help me to be still and patiently wait for you to move will you bring peace to my soul during this complicated time in our life instead of wanting so badly for all the details of each of these situations to line up perfectly and iron out smoothly will you show me that those things may never happen but that somehow through your grace i can still patiently parent my children i can still calmly respond to them i can have peace of mind i can sleep at night i can rest in knowing that you care for us and either youre going to make this easy and smooth or youre going to give us a million and one opportunities to have our character and faith refined over the next few months can you help me to see that both of those are equally good because right now i like the first option the best

3038645 tuesday was a potentially very important day the stock market followed through on a new rally as oil prices again dropped precipitously this bullish signal occurs after a major index hits a low and then experiences a big gain with volume higher than the day before there is a direct correlation between oil prices and the market since the markets lows keep in mind here is the line i say every time a follow through day occurs every bull move the market has ever had started with this characteristic but not every follow through led to a new bull market it is now time to build a watch list of leading stocks that have shown great relative strength during the bear phase and hopefully find them breaking out of bases on heavy volume if none show up this will tell you everything you need to know about the market in past weeks i have told you about the biotech medical truckers but that has been about it for leadership i will need to see more the biggest moves on tuesday were reserved for the areas that were hit the hardest and just trying to make up lost ground be patient take your time because if this is for real leadership will show up you cannot hide bull markets just as you cannot hide the bear markets the one thing i do at this point is to get off the short side meaning any inverse etf whether market based or sector based if this remains a bear market i can always revisit keep in mind the last follow through day in march lasted about 8 weeks and was very narrow with only a few commodity based areas leading i suspect we will need to see the important oil commodity continue to come in for the market to really get going lastly please do realize that in the past 2 days the dow is up 20 points s amp p 4 points and nasdaq 9 points that is how spastic things have been do not believe for a second this is going to be easy

3038666 this is something you dont see anywhere else and its a very good show
3038667 in the early 90s there was no real techno scene
3038668 there were several parties but after a while people founded a new techno club and i became a resident dj there spinning at one of the first clubs in munich
3038669 i also did parties in a tram going through munich
3038670 i rented the tram and a sound system and smoke machine
3038671 i had this idea because i knew in munich you could rent your own tram
3038672 most of the time trams were rented and i saw old people sitting and eating their pretzels and drinking beer listening to traditional bavarian music having an old fashioned party
3038673 so i thought hey lets give it a different aspect and do something for young people and make it really crazy
3038674 once we were stopped by the police because they thought there was a fire inside but it was only our smoke machine
3038675 it was always a lot of work but people loved it
3038676 when i moved to berlin i heard that people were still making parties on a tram with techno music so i think i started something
3038677 no i think a lot of artists are really in their own world
3038678 its a lot of work to make something like this and a lot of djs are not interested in doing something besides djing or producing music
3038679 we are planning another two parties at the end of the year in germany
3038680 we are still asking djs producers and live acts to see who is free and who will want to spin for free
3038681 its hard work because we have to get really popular djs to sign on with us
3038682 but the big names are always busy or in the studio or on tour and some people dont want to do a statement against racism which is sad
3038683 so we are still working on getting djs together now
3038684 we put our best offer and he has a say in the matter too
3038685 we can give him the best offer we can give him and thats all we can do theres always parameters whatever weve got good players im not worried about it
3038686 hes played at a tremendous level and i think hes still got a lot of rubber left on the tires
3038687 it was the first time hes played in two years he started off the game not quite getting where he was supposed to be and stuff like that which youd expect thats whats going to happen you have to have patience with those guys
3038688 i watched the 2000 election and i was stunned that we didnt know how to count ballots

3038694 para m es un privilegio estar en un club que la temporada pasada estuvo entre los mejores de espa a
3038695 hemos visto un club rodeado de cierto pesimismo y los que venimos nuevos tenemos que aspirar a cambiar eso
3038696 siempre son las m ximas a pesar de que la situaci n del club es complicada
3038697 ste es un proyecto que me ha ilusionado mucho me contagi el compromiso y la ilusi n del entrenador y voy a darlo todo
3038698 tenga problemas para encajar todas las piezas nuevas pero creo que no va a haber problemas para comenzar la liga al mismo nivel que los dem s equipos
3038699 me queda el relevo y ya est el 4x100 estilos quedan mireia belmonte erika villaecija aschwin wildeboer rafa mu oz que va tirando y al que el europeo le sali muy bien pero le falta experiencia y hay que seguir tirando
3038700 una medalla en los juegos es complicado mireia va a intentar entrar en la final de los 200 estilos pero es muy dif cil hablar de medalla es muy dif cil por no decir imposible hay que estar ah hay que luchar porque en unos juegos ol mpicos es muy complicado te cambia todo
3038701 tambi n dejo la nataci n por mi hija me gustar a dedicar m s tiempo a ella y ya tengo que jubilarme hacer mi vida quiero vivir como otros humanos porque realmente el deporte la nataci n no es la vida real es un tiempo que pasamos muy bien pero sacrificamos muchas cosas no es la vida real claro que es sano porque primero te hace mucha disciplina te crea car cter
3038702 un profesional se crea m s exigencias para l mismo que los dem s crean para l una persona que no es profesional entonces s que tiene que ser el entrenador el que tiene que estar ah esto esto esto pero un profesional es el que pone las metas
3038703 me gustar a poder nadar m s r pido pero en 50 por la ma ana est bien no es lo mismo hacer un europeo que una olimpiada al principio de la temporada estaba pensando que iba a ser muy complicado ir a los juegos estar toda la temporada bajando de 1 01 00 ya es un gran nivel
3038704 he cambiado un poco la t cnica no voy tan suelta noto la diferencia repetir 1 05 aqu tampoco era tan f cil
3038705 meterme en la final era complicado pero sacando mi marca he quedado bastante contenta
3038706 parece que natalie coughlin no va muy fina parece que no est reserv ndose veremos a ver primero la vi en atenas a kirsty coventry con uno once ah s que ha sido una sorpresa el r cord del mundo ayer tambi n lo bati aunque qued segunda el nivel es alt simo en todo

3038751 it was a vicious attack there was a lot of blood and i think in any interpretation that was a frenzied attack
3038752 we will work around the clock to catch those responsible we have a very experienced team of detectives working on this case we have the support of the local community the area command policing and the people of newcastle to catch whoever is responsible for this horrendous crime

3038787 the rudd labor government believes that there should be nationally available data school by school showing the socio economic status of all students and the numbers of indigenous children children with disabilities and children from non english speaking backgrounds especially recently arrived migrant backgrounds and refugee children

3038791 its important to differentiate between good stress and negative stress
3038792 good stress is motivating but as an employees stress level increases it reaches a tipping point where it starts to be detrimental and has a negative impact on an employees work
3038793 that tipping point will vary person to person based on personality attributes such as the ability to cope with pressure as well as job factors and aspects of the work environment
3038794 the vast majority of older australians are on the pension and a very significant number have very small additional amounts of private income as well as the pension

3038830 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3038831 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3038832 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3038833 what we have done is take two very different approaches to the challenge of creating bulk metamaterials that can exhibit negative refraction in optical frequencies
3038834 both bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
3038835 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
3038836 the magnetic field which oscillates at a perpendicular angle to the electrical field in a light wave is essentially blind to the upright nanowires a feature which significantly reduces energy loss
3038837 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss
3038838 weve also opened up a new approach to developing metamaterials by moving away from previous designs that were based upon the physics of resonance previous metamaterials in the optical range would need to vibrate at certain frequencies to achieve negative refraction leading to strong energy absorption resonance is not a factor in both the nanowire and fishnet metamaterials
3038839 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3038840 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3038841 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3038842 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3038874 the study shows how dopamine shapes the two main circuits of the brain that control how we choose to act and what happens in these disease states
3038875 dopamine released by drugs leads to abnormal strengthening of the cortical synapses driving the striatal go circuits while weakening synapses at opposing stop circuits as a result when events associated with drug taking where you took the drug what you were feeling occur there is an uncontrollable drive to go and seek drugs
3038876 all of our actions in a healthy brain are balanced by the urge to do something and the urge to stop
3038877 our work suggests that it is not just the strengthening of the brain circuits helping select actions that is critical to dopamines effects it is the weakening of the connections that enable us to stop as well
3038878 the study illuminates why parkinsons patients have trouble performing everyday tasks like reaching across a table to pick up a glass of water when they are thirsty
3038879 our study suggests that the inability to move in parkinsons disease is not a passive process like a car running out of gas
3038880 rather the car doesnt move because your foot is jammed down on the brake dopamine normally helps you adjust the pressure on the brake and gas pedals it helps you learn that when you see a red light at an intersection you brake and when the green light comes on you take your foot off the brake and depress the gas pedal to go parkinsons disease patients who have lost the neurons that release dopamine have their foot perpetually stuck on the brake
3038881 what we have done is take two very different approaches to the challenge of creating bulk metamaterials that can exhibit negative refraction in optical frequencies
3038882 both bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
3038883 natural materials do not respond to the magnetic field of light but the metamaterial we created here does
3038884 it is the first bulk material that can be described as having optical magnetism so both the electrical and magnetic fields in a light wave move backward in the material
3038885 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
3038886 the magnetic field which oscillates at a perpendicular angle to the electrical field in a light wave is essentially blind to the upright nanowires a feature which significantly reduces energy loss
3038887 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss
3038888 weve also opened up a new approach to developing metamaterials by moving away from previous designs that were based upon the physics of resonance previous metamaterials in the optical range would need to vibrate at certain frequencies to achieve negative refraction leading to strong energy absorption resonance is not a factor in both the nanowire and fishnet metamaterials
3038889 the healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria
3038890 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every millilitre of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth around half of these have yet to be named and we are trying to describe and name the new species
3038891 interestingly this species was isolated from within the oral tissues both in oral cancers and normal healthy tissue
3038892 this confirms other work showing that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells
3038893 we found one variant to be associated with weight and lean mass in both ethnic groups this variant was also associated with height total fat mass and hdl cholesterol but only in european american women a different variant was associated with triglyceride levels and hdl cholesterol in african american women
3038894 it was an advantage to be more anxious in a dangerous environment
3038895 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety
3038896 still to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
3038897 it might be possible to prescribe the right dose of the right drug relative to genetic makeup to treat anxiety disorders
3038898 referees decisions will tip the scales when athletes are relatively well matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior
3038899 although there is a need for further research including research on the effects of different colors our results suggest a need to change the rules or support referees by providing electronic decision making aids in those sports in which this color bias may be a problem
3038900 for instance weve learned that when someone has a haploid insufficiency and is missing one copy of the tgf gene he or she is more vulnerable to environmental insults that can cause cleft palate such as drugs smoking and alcohol
3038901 we found that if we blocked tgf or the receptors a cleft palate develops
3038902 but when smad4 was blocked normal palate epithelium still covered the palatal shelf
3038903 the closer together the hairs the more pressure the bubble can withstand before collapsing
3038904 we were surprised by the fact that in some cases bugs may be unable to survive in shallow water but we did discover they can safely dive as deep as 30 metres

3038906 weve been encouraging black men to get screened at age 40 or 45 for more than a decade yet only one third of these high risk men reported being tested
3038907 our findings provide an important baseline assessment of psa test use among young men as physicians debate whether to expand use of the psa test in young men with risk stratification strategies
3038908 acid sensitive channel inhibition prevents fetal alcohol spectrum disorders cerebellar purkinje cell loss
3038909 this study demonstrates that direct pharmacological blockade of task 1 and task 3 channels protects the most sensitive target of fetal alcohol exposure cerebellar purkinje cells
3038910 but the gap between the married and never married is closing especially for men
3038911 the times they are a changin marital status and health differentials from 1972 to 2003
3038912 politicians and scholars continue to debate the value of marriage for americans
3038913 with some going so far as to establish social programs and policies to encourage marriage among those socials groups less inclined to marry particularly the poor and minorities
3038914 encouraging marriage in order to promote health may be misguided
3038915 we need to design nanorectifiers that go with our nanoantennas
3038916 every time i look at that situation i feel blessed shame i got to look at my friend and see their situation as a blessing but it makes me feel better about my myself because like i said it couldnt be me
3038917 i never came upon any of my discoveries through the process of rational thinking
3038918 all those within the four seas can be considered brothers
3038919 i thought people would be honest enough to see me as a person who was trying to do something good and not as a celebrity
3038920 to begin with let us take the following motto literature is love now we can continue
3038921 i can be changed by what happens to me but i refuse to be reduced by it
3038922 style is knowing who you are what you want to say and not giving a damn
3038923 perfume is like love you can never get enough of it
3038924 yesterday is history tomorrow is mystery today is a gift
3038925 no one can make you feel inferior without your consent

3038944 the phone was a disappointment from the standpoint that it couldnt maintain a consistent connection with the 3g network all the other features were fantastic
3038945 frankly if i knew it was going to be like this i wouldnt have paid the extra 10 a month
3038946 what were seeing is that the iphone 3g is performing very well
3038947 im not denying that people are having problems but we have to deal with these on a case by case basis
3038948 my belief is that because at amp ts network is not built out to every cell site people are getting frustrated because theyre finding places where the 3g signal isnt available or is weak
3038949 that doesnt mean you cant get a good experience on 1900mhz
3038950 typically the more you pack into a phone the tougher it is to build a really good one
3038951 sometimes customers may want to pin a problem on the device
3038952 or they want to pin it on the operator but really it doesnt matter how well they work separately they need to work together

3038954 they should admit that there is an issue and that they are working through it

3038967 the investigation into the murders of the mullany couple is ongoing no one has so far been charged in relation to this investigation however investigators are currently focusing on forensic evidence reviewing of notes statements and interviews
3038968 while we cannot give the details of this line of investigation at this stage we are optimistic that at the completion of this stage of investigation investigators should be much closer to arresting and charge the perpetrator s of this heinous crime
3038969 i hope someone out there will come forward to help put my mums killer away and to let her rest in peace and to allow myself and my family to continue life the best we can
3038970 my mum was a lovely woman who would not hurt a fly she was friendly and would talk to anyone who would talk to her
3038971 there is no known reason why someone would do what they did
3038972 i hope that because of advances in science and technology her killer can be found
3038973 they were two nice hard working respectable people who have come to the uk for the best of reasons to get a good education they had both worked hard while at newcastle university and both had done extremely well graduating with good degrees

3039020 i say to our sunni brothers in iraq that we are brothers and the occupier divided us in order to weaken the iraqi people
3039021 in unity is strength and in division weakness we say to them welcome at any time
3039022 i am ready to cooperate with them at all levels this is my hand i stretch out to them in so doing i seek only gods satisfaction
3039023 we want a united and democratic iraq that does not follow the occupations agenda
3039024 we signed with them a pledge charter which we hope will be the nucleus of future agreements with other brothers whether sunni kurdish or otherwise
3039025 no no for satan no no for america no no for the occupation no no for israel
3039026 in recent years science has deepened our understanding of climate change it opened new possibilities for confronting it

3039032 our military are doing a remarkable job in the most difficult circumstances but our government is not doing what needs to be done in development aid or counter narcotics policies to be sure that we have the support of the afghan people
3039033 without winning the hearts and minds of the afghan people we will continue to win the battles but we will not the war

3039040 as we lose manufacturing jobs were going to move more into nontraditional occupations
3039041 the issues arent different whether its a health care facility or a factory its about having a voice

3039043 the question is have unions fallen so far and so fast that they cant get up
3039044 said gary chaison a labor specialist at clark university in worcester mass
3039045 i thought i was going to be there for my 30 years when i started working there i was very excited to have that job i loved going to work
3039046 its all around them they just have to use their imagination
3039047 workers are looking for an organization that solves problems not one that creates them
3039048 for way too long weve tried to stay the same and in some cases stop change
3039049 it is very difficult for the unions to get a foothold where there is not a need

3039066 the bishop and diocese remain firmly convinced of the need for alternative oversight

3039142 ive had my eye on ben curtis for a long time and i really believe that ben curtis is going to add a lot to this team
3039143 so i could not be more excited for him i have not talked to him yet and its going to be kind of like a consolation prize a little bit for him he played terrific this week he didnt lose the pga padraig harrington went out and won it and ben played terrific all the way to the end
3039144 weve got eight established players im really excited about who we have on the team
3039145 the next three weeks are going to be really important for the remainder of the pga tour because as i look at it right now anybody can get on this team
3039146 i have some really good friends that play this tour that are out there with chances to get on this team and theres a bunch of guys who i dont know at all who have an opportunity to get on this team and some of them are close
3039147 hes established goals for himself and you know he unfortunately had to withdraw this week i guess he had a scratched cornea i dont know what that feels like i dont know how hard that is to recover from but im excited about kenny perry being on the team ive known kenny for a long time we used to play against each other on the mini tours
3039148 hopefully i can bring some of that into the locker room and the team room and just have a positive influence on the event and especially on the guys on the team and on captain azinger

3039158 hes got to be part of the jigsaw puzzle were trying to put together and im looking forward to working with him
3039159 he brings power pace size and the experience of playing regularly in the premier league and playing in a side that did reasonably well in the premier league
3039160 hes another international footballer and lets hope the quality he possesses can help the team im sure he sees this as a new challenge and one where he hopes to make a good impression
3039161 its a very expensive option but again it would be one if we got the option to speak to the lad or the opportunity to speak to the lad then who knows

3039364 the most pressure filled trial is nothing like a fight in front of 20 000 people even millions of people
3039365 people think athletes arent that smart to begin with especially boxers so getting a law degree gave me the ability to get some credibility in that regard
3039366 i think its unhealthy to look back and fixate on it
3039367 my medal i think its in a drawer somewhere we dont have pictures from the olympics up on the walls either
3039368 the olympics for me was very pressure filled and i have probably not all that many great memories from it quite frankly
3039369 i was fully expected to win the gold and coming up with a silver was a bit of a disappointment
3039370 it was like euphoria after i won but it didnt take long to say what now how do you beat this in life reaching a gold medal on a podium on the olympic games
3039371 it was kind of a reality check realizing this is only a small part of my life
3039372 i thought i was going to retch the first two years when that red light came on in the studio

3039375 one of the realizations i had was this is one of the best educations to try to do all this on my own without any real support

3039444 working in a market like china is very challenging from a cultural perspective there was a lot of uncertainty about this 3g technology and as it was vendor agnostic we were required to train hundreds of people in its use
3039445 china has now proven it can deliver technological breakthroughs on the world stage although perhaps not a breakthrough technology td scdma will underpin the framework for 4g mobile technologies in the future
3039446 chinas censorship firewall wasnt an issue as it sits outside the carriers control
3039447 the political bureaucracy on the other hand was not so easy to navigate
3039448 but by the same token the chinese government owns all the operators there so its not like in australia where you will see carriers go head to head with the government on all manner of arguments
3039449 its very important for the government and the regulator to maintain the impetus towards competition and not to allow the nbn to be the sole supplier of infrastructure in competitive areas
3039450 its a peculiarly australian phenomenon for the cable operator to rely so heavily on competitors assets even in areas where it has its own network
3039451 its a mistake to allow optus to unbundle telstras local loop in the footprint of its hfc network it removes an opportunity to maximise infrastructure competition between the two networks
3039452 if you get infrastructure competitors to invest in infrastructure you get product differentiation and essentially you get an investment race
3039453 its fair to say from the optus perspective that telstra is pretty adept at twisting the facts
3039454 the problem in australia is that there was insufficient policy to properly govern telstras hfc rollout telstra was allowed to overbuild the optus hfc network and was allowed to take a dominant position in pay tv
3039455 those two factors destroyed the viability of optuss rollout because we didnt have the key point of differentiation
3039456 they essentially had a head start in the investment race
3039457 we will find over time that australia will have one ubiquitous broadband network with limited infrastructure based competition
3039458 these results are going to be less about 2008 and more about 2009 and 2010

3039470 as far as we are concerned nobody should feel offended if investigated it is what the laws say that we will do it is misconception to look at the status of a person and conclude that you are not going to investigate him
3039471 they are 20 or 23 of the former state governors i believe that in the next two weeks we will know which of them are to be investigated or not some of them are already being prosecuted for money laundering money laundering is not in our mandate
3039472 we dont need an independent counsel to investigate and prosecute them
3039473 we are scrutinizing the files to see whether there are cases that we could now pursue many of these allegations were committed as far back as 2003 we need to see which of these allegations are motivated for election purposes
3039474 for this category of people we dont need an independent counsel
3039475 the chief justice will study the allegations and consider whether it is worthwhile to appoint independent counsel to investigate those allegations
3039476 we are waiting for them to complete the exercise and whether the report is sent to us for prosecution or not we are going to ask for the transcript then through the transcript we will see how the system had permitted such things to happen

3039479 in addition to the data centre at the efcc headquarters two others will be established one at the efcc office in ikoyi lagos and the other at the nigerian financial intelligence unit nfiu in abuja

3039482 the donation takes the lnp closer to responding faster and more efficiently to emergency situations
3039483 we were really persistent and proactive to work with the record companies making them investors with imeem
3039484 no one has done that before in a legal way
3039485 in terms of the distribution they have a very positive platform
3039486 they have created their own network and can also attract other users from different social networking sites
3039487 imeem wont be a widely profitable model unless they have other ways to distribute their service
3039488 people came to imeem so quickly because they had the music they want but they can go other places as well
3039489 as the industry changes we are looking for more different models for growing bands
3039490 its really hard to get people to spend money on music but going to sites like imeem is a good way to learn about the band before you buy tickets
3039491 if they were promoting our artists and we would be giving them content it would make sense to have some kind of relationship with them
3039492 big brands are willing to pay higher rates to reach customers and ad rates are actually higher than people realize
3039493 over time as long as sites continue to provide value for advertisers the rates are going to be sustainable
3039494 the education over there until the undergrad level is pretty good
3039495 but when it comes to grad school it just falls off the cliff in terms of quality
3039496 why should punjab get him we want to offer him even more
3039497 when someone gets some notoriety as sabeer did after selling hotmail they get bombarded with offers
3039498 if someone like sabeer is attached to a project then the thinking is other people will want to invest
3039499 but my reason for doing this is to leave behind a legacy

3039506 the state leaves it to the businessperson to negotiate his way through the thicket of corruption and lack of information that typically surrounds land records in rural areas
3039507 a piece of agricultural land will often have multiple claimants indebtedness and prior claims over the generations
3039508 every subsequent acre of land we were buying was more expensive than the previous one
3039509 we think that over 95 percent of all the farmers actually want to sell
3039510 we think this will put pressure on that remaining 5 percent of people who are maybe greedy for more money

3039516 it is kpmgs contention that in the next few years it professionals will be asked to work with the whole business to construct a sophisticated and robust set of measurement instrumentation and reporting tools for non financial data to track the flow of carbon through their business to the same level of detail that financial reporting tools do
3039517 a large number of it organisations are only giving sustainability cursory attention
3039518 at the moment there is way too much emphasis on getting our own house in order as it professionals with the emergence of these new tools will come the opportunity to seize leadership and engage with the whole business about how technology can be used to reduce the other 98 per cent of emissions that the it industry is not directly responsible for
3039519 its not enough to just green your data centre and apply virtualisation and think your job is done
3039520 it professionals have to step up to the plate and engage in a dialogue with the business to let them know technology has a role to improve the whole organisations environmental footprint

3039532 el hablar actual sobre dios tiende a alejarse del compromiso con los dogmas o ritos de las religiones establecidas la invocaci n a dios es quiz ansia de una fuerza que d sentido a la propia vida claro que la aproximaci n a lo divino sigue estando mediada por las grandes religiones monote stas y por el creciente evangelismo y otros cultos como hare krishna budismo yoga o cultos populares como el del gauchito gil pero ahora las v as tradicionales y colectivas de la religi n conviven con la aparici n de un sujeto que puede ser receptivo a varias creencias religiosas pero sin perder por esto su independencia su no pertenencia formal a ning n culto en particular
3039533 si los profetas abraham isaac jacob ismael jos o jesucristo la paz est con l estuvieran hoy entre nosotros c mo juzgar an tales conductas
3039534 me han dicho que su excelencia sigue las ense anzas de jes s la paz est con l y que cree en la promesa divina de un reinado de los justos en la tierra

3039536 el liberalismo y la democracia de corte occidental no han podido contribuir a la realizaci n de los ideales de la humanidad
3039537 nos guste o no el mundo gravita hacia la fe en el todopoderoso y la justicia y la voluntad de dios prevalecer n sobre todas las cosas
3039538 el fin de las ideolog as de los grandes discursos pol ticos y ticos dej a los hombres desamparados y stos se refugian en un cielo que permite todos los delirios para hacer la vida m s vivible argumenta no satisfecho con la prohibici n de comer el fruto prohibido dios no ces de manifestarse mediante interdicciones las religiones monote stas no viven sino de prescripciones y de exhortaciones hacer y no hacer decir y no decir pensar y no pensar prohibido y autorizado l cito e il cito los textos religiosos abundan en codificaciones existenciales alimentarias de comportamiento rituales etc tera
3039539 la religi n surge de la necesidad de dar sentido a la realidad de escapar al caos que significa el sinsentido el hombre desde un principio no dej de experimentar una fractura que hab a despedazado su integridad algo andaba mal se necesitaba una recomposici n para que el caos no terminara de arrojarlo al sinsentido surge entonces una actividad esencialmente simb lica destinada a otorgar sentido al grupo etnia tribu o pueblo y en consecuencia al individuo es la religi n
3039540 dios no est muerto ni agonizante al contrario de lo que pensaba nietzsche porque no es mortal las ficciones no mueren las ilusiones tampoco un cuento para ni os no se puede refutar ni el hipogrifo ni el centauro est n sometidos a la ley de los mam feros un pavo real un caballo s un animal del bestiario mitol gico no ahora bien dios proviene del bestiario mitol gico como miles de otras criaturas que aparecen en los diccionarios en innumerables entradas entre d meter y discordia as pues dios durar tanto como las razones que lo hacen existir sus negadores tambi n parece un inmortal
3039541 la religi n dijo sus ltimas palabras inteligibles nobles o inspiradoras hace mucho tiempo a partir de ese momento se convirti en un humanismo admirable pero nebuloso igual que le pas por ejemplo a dietrich bonhoeffer un valiente pastor luterano ahorcado por los nazis por negarse a actuar en connivencia con ellos no habr m s profetas ni sabios de antiguo cu o lo cual es la raz n por la que las devociones de hoy en d a son nicamente ecos de repeticiones del ayer a veces elaboradas hasta el hilarante extremo de conjurar una terrible vacuidad
3039542 ya fuera para responder al desaf o de la ciencia moderna ya para sentar las bases desde las cuales predicar el cristianismo a mundos y culturas remotas lo cierto es que la iglesia fue desarrollando de modo progresivo toda una doctrina de los preambula fidei en relaci n cada vez m s estrecha con una metaf sica de tipo objetivista
3039543 coincido con hume y con kant en que el concepto de prueba emp rica es irrelevante a la hora de hablar de dios pero este punto sirve por igual contra el ate smo y el te smo el presidente bush ha aportado un buen argumento cuando dijo en un discurso destinado a complacer a los fundamentalistas cristianos que el ate smo es una fe pues no puede confirmarse ni refutarse mediante argumentos o pruebas pero lo mismo puede aplicarse desde luego al te smo ni los que afirman ni los que niegan la existencia de dios pueden reclamar de forma plausible tener pruebas de su parte ser religioso en el occidente moderno no tiene mucho que ver con la explicaci n de fen menos espec ficamente observables
3039544 el renacimiento de la religi n en el tercer milenio no viene motivado tanto por las amenazas globales el terrorismo o la cat strofe ecol gica planetaria como por la muerte de dios por la secularizaci n de lo sagrado que ha estado en el centro del proceso a trav s del cual se ha desarrollado la civilizaci n del mundo occidental
3039545 hay nuevos relatos que ponen en juego soluciones imaginarias creencias m gicas cosas que son semejantes a los mitos simples supersticiones relatos vinculados a mentalidades primitivas que aparecen junto a la religi n tradicional
3039546 en oriente y occidente la humanidad acosada por el mpetu tecnol gico las guerras la discutible muerte de dios la falta de cielos protectores el exceso de desencantos y los fracasos de las utop as recurre al di logo de caracter sticas religiosas
3039547 la cuesti n de la p rdida es una construcci n de nuestra sociedad porque en realidad lo sagrado es ahist rico la p rdida es relativa depende de qui n lo enuncia el mundo de lo sagrado es din mico y cambiante a lo largo del tiempo en todo caso la diferencia es que ahora hay conciencia de lo sagrado

3039551 mit seiner zukunftsorientierten erfolgreichen 12 j hrigen bildungspolitik wollte er allen kindern die bestm gliche ausbildung nach ihren f higkeiten erm glichen und war bestrebt soziale bildungsbarrieren auch zwischen stadt und land abzubauen
3039552 kann man ermessen wie sehr er auch in dieser funktion ein staatsmann blieb der das gemeinsame und den ausgleich vor das trennende stellte
3039553 letztlich war es das verdienst von kanzler sinowatz dass man auf die anliegen der umweltsch tzer eingehen konnte parteiinterne konflikte beigelegt wurden und der soziale frieden erhalten blieb
3039554 auch stets konsequent geblieben und hat sich nicht verbiegen lassen
3039555 ich habe es immer als zutiefst ungerecht empfunden wie unreflektiert ein angeblicher sinowatz ausspruch wiedergegeben wurde tats chlich lautet ja die fragliche stelle aus seiner regierungserkl rung 1983 die auf die anstehenden herausforderungen einging ich wei das klingt alles sehr kompliziert dass man sich dar ber l cherlich machte und es zu seiner trademark zu stilisieren versuchte war und ist absurd

3039563 this of course begs a question are we merely studying a set of companies that just happened by luck to stumble into the right set of decision or was there something distinctive about their process that dramatically increased the likelihood of being right the answer it turns out is that there was something quite distinctive about their process the good to great companies displayed two distinctive forms of disciplined thought the first is that they infused the entire process with the brutal facts of reality and the second is that they developed a simple yet deeply insightful frame of reference for all decisions when as in the kroger case you start with an honest and diligent effort to determine the truth of the situation the right decisions often become self evident not always of course but often and even if all decisions do not become self evident one thing is certain you absolutely cannot make a series of good decisions without first confronting the brutal facts the good to great companies operated in accordance with this principle and the comparison companies generally did not

3039583 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
3039584 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
3039585 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
3039586 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
3039587 you told me more about the process than i know
3039588 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
3039589 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
3039590 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
3039591 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
3039592 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
3039593 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands

3039599 at the moment i as a cricketer feel left out with the whole worlds focus is on the beijing olympics
3039600 inclusion of cricket in the olympics would give cricket a whole new identity as the games is massive i guess the all icc full members can get direct entry to the main event and the other teams can come in through qualifiers
3039601 also the best cricketers in the world should be eligible to play and there should not be any age limit
3039602 it will be a decision welcomed by professional cricketers if it happens
3039603 besides who doesnt want to be part of an event so huge the twenty20 version is ideally suited to the olympics as it has mass pulling power and entertainment value

3039632 hopefully that will result in a plan if he wants to go with the de la hoya fight ill contact richard schaefer and will start that negotiations
3039633 its gonna take maybe a week or so but theres no reason for undue haste its a very important decision for mannys career a lot of money involved and were gonna go slowly
3039634 its an honor to fight a legend like de la hoya if this fight pushes through i will give my very best in preparing for this fight
3039635 i believe freddie when he said i can beat de la hoya
3039636 im telling you as jeffs attorney a deal has been reached

3039643 over the last two weeks how often have you been bothered by the following problem thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way
3039644 it is worrying that despite improvements in cancer care a substantial number of patients feel they would be better off dead
3039645 we know that depression is common in patients who have cancer but it is often missed
3039646 pain is also a big problem treating patients symptoms as well as their disease might improve and even save their lives
3039647 it is normal to experience distress after a cancer diagnosis
3039648 but for some patients emotional distress or depression becomes a problem in itself and may lead to suicidal thoughts
3039649 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety
3039650 still to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
3039651 it might be possible to prescribe the right dose of the right drug relative to genetic makeup to treat anxiety disorders

3039653 the healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria
3039654 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every millilitre of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth
3039655 it confirms that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells
3039656 many of these bacteria have not been described because they are quite hard to grow in the lab and when you go further down into the digestive system it gets even harder to do this
3039657 these bacteria are thought to have an involvement in dental caries and other mouth problems so describing them gives you a broader picture of the causation of these
3039658 my personal interpretation is that the gains of politics on the african continent as it is constituted now are so lucrative that those who find themselves in office do not want to leave power it has something to do with resources that come into the system and under the control of those who run power
3039659 african leaders will have to learn to gracefully bow out
3039660 we have a new generation of people coming up who know nothing else but vote buying that is where the danger is
3039661 it is important that those lobbying for people to become vice presidential nominees on our partys ticket do that with caution and not put undue pressure on our presidential candidate to make a wrong decision
3039662 it is completely unacceptable for people to be lobbying publicly and mobilising people to be speaking publicly
3039663 so chaotic is been unacceptable and i hold all those lobbying for the job responsible for this indisciplined form of going about things

3039709 it annoys me when pathetic jealous people cannot take it that some people are more intelligent than them
3039710 the tories will not even save their deposit in glasgow east
3039711 yes it does touch a nerve it annoys me when pathetic jealous people cannot take it that some people are more intelligent than them so they have to try and put down the entire academic system
3039712 i know you are deeply jealous of that because your highest academic record is having learning what the letter d on the hat teacher gives you
3039713 if they can continue their development the way they have done up to now there is no reason why they cant have great careers at everton
3039714 its really important that all the younger players at everton see there are opportunities for them that there is a way to go
3039715 even the lads younger than these can see the jack rodwells and the dan goslings getting a chance in the first team its great motivation for them
3039716 the chairman and the manager are trying very hard to bring in players and hopefully well see something materialise in the next week or two to support these young lads

3039722 ich kann nicht jeder frau in die ich verliebt bin nach einem halben jahr einen heiratsantrag machen bevor es zu entt uschungen kommt mache ich lieber reinen tisch
3039723 sie war mit jemandem zusammen der sie nicht gut behandelt hat
3039724 da bin ich mir ganz sicher wenn wir den weg gemeinsam beschlie en und ein parteitag die zustimmung gibt werden alle abgeordneten bis auf frau dagmar metzger die ihre meinung auch nicht ndert meinen weg mit unterst tzen
3039725 ich bin keine basta politikerin sondern ich frage schon auch die partei welchen weg sie mit mir gehen will ich m chte eine m glichst breite beteiligung auch derer die wahlkampf gemacht haben wie es denn weitergehen soll und da bieten sich regionalkonferenzen an
3039726 das ist zun chst erstmal eine entscheidung der hessischen freundinnen und freunde
3039727 wir sind bereit beratend und mit berlegungen zur seite zu stehen alles andere was an ffentlichen ratschl gen gegeben wird ist nicht ganz hilfreich
3039728 wir sind hier nicht in einer parallelwelt wir sind teil der gesamt spd
3039729 i wish he could hear this message he could really use help with
3039730 abstain from all thinking about other peoples faults unless your duties as a teacher or parent make it necessary to think about them whenever the thoughts come unnecessarily into ones mind why not simply shove them away and think of ones own faults instead for there with gods help one can do something of all the awkward people in your house or job there is only one whom you can improve very much that is the practical end at which to begin and really wed better the job has to be tackled some day and every day we put it off will make it harder to begin
3039731 the policy at the moment is that you have to play in the previous competition to the all blacks team being named and by that we usually mean the super 14 before the tri nations or the air new zealand cup before the november tour
3039732 its a different level of fast at the linebacker position
3039733 the kids are working very hard theyre playing fast its important to them they have a focus right now

3039740 es wird zunehmend ein streit sichtbar nach dem motto welche polizei bilden wir aus
3039741 davon halten wir nichts wir sind eine zivile polizei die sich an gesetzen orientiert und nicht im b rgerkrieg t tig ist das ist bei paramilit rischen einheiten anders wir k nnen nicht die verantwortung f r etwas bernehmen was wir nicht wollen
3039742 nicht eingetroffen alle haben immer zusagen gemacht und in wirklichkeit tat sich gar nichts
3039743 wir haben immer wert gelegt auf eine klassische polizeiausbildung und nicht auf eine paramilit rische

3039747 it is not suitable for afl football the way it was presented then
3039748 it is a concern looking long term too when you are talking a team in west sydney where you are going to play a game there a week they would want to fix it up because a it is not safe and b it is not a great advertisement for the game
3039749 it doesnt matter whether its one week out from finals or round one weve got to supply grounds that are suitable for games of football without trying to hide any truths
3039750 last time the surface wasnt up to the standard that wed hoped
3039751 we wrote to the afl to make sure of it and they have just as big a vested interest in making the oval right as we do
3039752 we assume all of that that they requested has happened
3039753 well they are worried about the surface im hoping bomber geelong coach mark thompson might leave about a dozen of his players back in victoria
3039754 i havent been out there but i have been reading what geelong have been saying and they seem comfortable with it and the afl seem comfortable with it i am expecting it to be pretty good on saturday night
3039755 i have walked on the ground many times and it is a disgusting surface for our players to play on

3039764 this is indeed a delightful room let us come here often it is secluded and quiet and we can fellowship together
3039765 i will be here early every morning meet me here and we will start the day together
3039766 he is my guest i invited him into my heart he has come as my savior and friend and yet i am neglecting him

3039775 lord i have learned my lesson i know now that i cant have a good time without you from now on we will do everything together

3039781 lord is there any chance that you would take over the management of the whole house and operate it for me as you did that closet would you take the responsibility to keep my life what it ought to be

3039842 the precision targeting and execution of the attack on the hull of the vessel by al qaeda operatives was almost identical to the mode of attack conducted by the lttes sea tigers one could discern from the similarity of attacks that there would have been a transfer of knowledge and expertise in the field of maritime terrorism

3039853 our position is clear the chinese are not here for peace and they must leave immediately otherwise we will consider the chinese soldiers as part of the government forces and we will act accordingly china is complicit in the genocide being carried out in darfur and the chinese are here to protect their oil interests in kordofan
