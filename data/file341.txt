3410001 there were concerns that bottles were not a desirable application for biodegradables because they are indistinguishable from other polymers
3410002 composting should not be the standard treatment for pla packaging waste as it cannot be expected to provide the environmental benefits achievable by chemical recycling and energy recovery
3410003 we are still in the early days with pla if you go back to the early 1950s when petrochemical plastics were coming on to the market then there would not have been an answer to questions about feed stock or waste management
3410004 if there were more pla packs in the supply chain would the composting facilities be prepared to deal with it
3410005 as the use of bioplastics increases we feel there should be more research done to understand the impact on existing recycling and composting systems theres a need to make sure it doesnt jeopardise whats there already
3410006 unlikely to be removed because of the cost to the reprocessors
3410007 if you speak to reprocessors they really dont want pla in the bottle stream if the amount rises they might have to look at rejecting whole batches of waste plastic
3410008 the technology is coming along to produce products out of this waste if you use the agricultural feedstock effectively then there should be enough in the supply chain to meet both food and other needs
3410009 someone or other will find another way of doing it and then natureworks wont control the supply chain

3410043 for the parents to now turn around and engage in this kind of activity i can assure you that should we be successful in our defense we will go after them for every dime that the taxpayers may have to spend to defend the city in this particular situation
3410044 it is outrageous beyond the outrage that we have experienced in the past week look its america and people file all kinds of suits all the time about a lot of different things but this is really beyond the pale

3410057 our study shows that early weight loss can reduce the risk factors that so often lead to diabetes complications and death
3410058 weve known for a long time that weight loss is an important component in diabetes treatment and prevention now it appears there may be a critical window of opportunity following diagnosis in which some lasting gains can be achieved if people are willing to take immediate steps toward lifestyle changes
3410059 we dont know if the initial weight loss increased the bodys sensitivity to insulin or if the sustained lifestyle changes were the reason for the long term health benefits
3410060 but we do know that losing weight reduces the risk factors that often lead to heart disease blindness nerve and kidney damage amputations and death in type 2 diabetes patients

3410113 they are adaptable and can quickly make low carbon lifestyles and career choices a part of their daily lives youth should therefore be given a chance to take an active part in the decision making of local national and global levels and they can actively support initiatives that will lead to the passage of far reaching legislation
3410114 unless we make radical changes in the way we live by the time the youth of 2008 reach my age the world may well have become a rather inhospitable place
3410115 in many developing countries in particular youth especially girls and young women are often responsible for farming finding water and collecting fuel wood these tasks will be rendered more difficult and will take even more time away from education or productive activities as climate change affects the availability of water agricultural productivity and the survival of ecosystems

3410124 since real estate tanked many new planned communities across the country are half empty with for sale signs outnumbering residents by a large margin daily life in these developments seems a bit post cataclysmic children play on elaborate but empty playgrounds they walk their dogs past rows of shiny houses that have never been lived in voices echo up and down the block unfinished houses and vacant lots strewn with construction debris clutter the horizon
3410125 the market is not an outcome nor is it an end unto itself rather the market is a process by which people discover effective and not so effective ways to satisfy our needs and wants entrepreneurship is essential this consists of appraising the factors of production in the market and undertaking new production plans based on the expectation that such an endeavor will be profitable those who choose wisely are rewarded with profits those who choose poorly are punished with losses

3410130 residential consumers of inergy supplied propane gas are having to spend more to heat their homes this winter because of these excessively high prices
3410131 if a consumer has a 500 gallon propane tank and is being charged even 1 over the market price to fill the tank the consumer is being overcharged by 500 that is unacceptable
3410132 just like in any case when we receive a consumer complaint we investigate it
3410133 we investigated them and we found that they are violating the michigans consumer protection act
3410134 the pricing practices at all of inergys operations in michigan are legal and consistent with local and industry standards as well as with historical pricing practices our pricing programs provide budget certainty to thousands of customers who rely on us for heating their homes

3410138 the world banks lending record does not match up to zoellicks rhetoric
3410139 the institution is simply not slowing down its significant funding to fossil fuel projects that will emit greenhouse gases for 20 to 40 years
3410140 the mission of the world bank group is to alleviate poverty and one way it does that is to increase access to energy
3410141 they are emitting increasingly large quantities of greenhouse gases which has consequences for the entire global climate
3410142 the oil industry certainly does not need soft loans from a multilateral poverty reduction agency
3410143 the private sector can do this perfectly well on its own

3410443 after about an hour and a half of fishing i noticed the only other boat fishing was heading in and suggested that we do the same the sea had got a little rougher by this time but did not cause any concern as we had been out in worse
3410444 while we were heading inland the boat had started to take in water but i was able to manually pump this out without warning a large wave hit the stern of the boat and jack headed towards me to help me bail out
3410445 as he did so the combined weight of us both caused the stern to submerge and within a matter of seconds the whole of the boat was submerged
3410446 i helped jack to reach a creel buoy and told him to keep hold of that while i swam for help i swam for about 200 yards when the sea became worse and it started to rain i was finding conditions difficult and also got hold of a creel buoy
3410447 after around 45 minutes i managed to detach the buoy from the rope i then used this to keep myself a float i headed for shore all the time thinking i had to make it for my wife and daughter and to get help for jack
3410448 i eventually reached shore after being in the water for approximately three hours and i was then able to summon help
3410449 i am absolutely devastated at the loss of jack who was a great friend to me one of my biggest regrets is that we didnt have life jackets and i just hope that other people will learn from this tragic accident the importance of safety equipment
3410450 anybody taking to sea in a craft whether it be a dinghy or jet ski to an 18ft boat should have the appropriate life saving equipment
3410451 this tragic accident serves to highlight the necessity to carry suitable equipment such as lifejackets or flares on board your vessel no matter how experienced how calm the conditions might be and how far you might travel
3410452 our thoughts go out to the family and friends at this very difficult time it would be impossible to state whether a lifejacket would have affected the outcome in this particular case due to timescales and weather conditions
3410453 the rnli actively encourages the constant use of buoyancy aids or lifejackets to all sea users although there is never a guarantee of survival at sea due to the relatively cold waters around the uk lifejackets do provide the ability to stay afloat using minimal effort therefore allowing the user to preserve energy which is vital
3410454 a nightmare is much more intense than a bad dream it can arouse feelings of fear horror and distress
3410455 it replicates our deepest fears and can reflect the different types of stresses we face in our waking world
3410456 nightmarish thoughts such as losing your job being homeless falling and being chased are a manifestation of how much the credit crunch is affecting our daily lives and causing distressed sleep patterns
3410457 its no wonder gordon brown and alistair darling are making a special appearance in our nightmares at the moment both symbolise the fears we are facing in todays economy
3410458 disturbances of your sleep can have many different effects they can wake you up or maybe as some people suggest have an effect on your dreams
3410459 anything that can give you a disturbed sleep is going to make your sleep uncomfortable whatever form that takes
3410460 if you have a lot on your mind before you go to sleep sit up and write it down once youve done that it is off your mind and you shouldnt think about it
3410461 the average guy being able to compete with a guru and gain the upper hand
3410462 patients who dont fit the highest priority category simply wont get booked into any of the clinics to see the specialists theyve been referred to when they present
3410463 thats one way of categorising patients but there are other interventions and approaches you can use in managing the workload
3410464 all we are suggesting is the kids think hes dreamy
3410465 really i feel like ive already seen this play like 50 times
3410466 im going to lie low for a while and work on this or that
3410467 regarding the upcoming governors race between incumbent christine gregoire and dino rossi
3410468 for the 2000 loss in florida we heard in 2004
3410469 extra uncounted votes in ballot boxes that nobody seemed to know about when a democrat is lagging behind a republican in a close race
3410470 it was a very good week for the american public
3410471 giving the next administration the tools it will need to start putting public health and especially the health of our children first
3410472 its time democrats put their boarding passes back in their pockets and get to work by voting on the american energy act
3410473 people are hurting theres no question in my mind i fully understand it
3410474 people in need trying to come up with real solutions
3410475 make sure your tires are properly inflated we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
3410476 democrats promised you when they took back control of the congress by storm in 2006
3410477 this is the peoples house this is not pelosis politburo
3410478 this november by supporting and electing conservative candidates for the house take back the house for america not for the democrats or rinos whose only interest is themselves
3410479 now we are protecting both the tourists and the ancient monuments
3410480 go away the police told us not to talk to you
3410481 now i dont know if i will be here tomorrow i have five children a wife what will happen to us

3410485 we strengthen both they complete their collection of animals and we get equipment
3410486 venezuela is going to get animals of very good quality
3410487 its a very delicate animal and you have to treat it like a child
3410488 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
3410489 if we want to understand whats going to happen to climate in the future we need to know what the sea ice is going to do will there be more or less and will it form more or less rapidly
3410490 until now our ability to represent the high latitude oceans and sea ice in oceanographic and climate models has suffered as a result
3410491 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3410492 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3410493 i say dont make too much noise lets just head towards soggul and wave him down and see how he is
3410494 i didnt know if you all made it away i am very thankful you did with only minor wounds
3410495 i could sure use a rest and a little rejuvenation

3410506 the new legislation has made consumers hesitant about jumping in
3410507 when youve got nowhere to aim for its difficult people are not feeling confident and are deciding to hold off
3410508 there is quite a bit of uncertainty there for buyers and its also frustrating for agents and vendors
3410509 some vendors have decided its the new laws more purchaser friendly than vendor friendly so were seeing a lot more choosing not to auction ive seen more agents across adelaide choosing not to auction and advising their clients accordingly
3410510 what it may have done is caused people to think twice about going to auction because of the uncertainty
3410511 agents and vendors are adopting a wait and see attitude
3410512 crowd numbers are down but thats more to do with the weather
3410513 high def is hot and fios tv is delivered over the network thats built for hd

3410515 what makes this promotion compelling is the fact that it focuses on an increasingly popular feature the dvr in a way that will appeal to both late and early adopters of dvrs
3410516 with this offer consumers who have always wanted a dvr can get one for free for 12 months by moving to fios tv and those that already use a dvr can extend that experience throughout their home at no charge for 12 months by signing up for fios tv and its home media dvr service this is a good example of how a service provider can leverage its technological advantages to attract new business
3410517 when you combine our superior voice video and broadband all delivered on our advanced network with unbeatable packages its clear that cable just cant compete
3410518 were no longer the gate keepers sometimes now when rumor arises were going to need to address it
3410519 it was just an unreal feeling to be on the btcc podium
3410520 with the pace the cars have got im sure we can be up there again to do it at this level and be up on that podium was amazing
3410521 the teachers view the decision to strike as a last resort

3410538 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3410539 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3410540 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3410541 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3410542 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3410543 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3410544 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3410545 clearly overdone but the 35 fall in a month is equally unsustainable
3410546 unmistakable economic contraction of apocalyptic proportions would be necessary and this is not the case
3410547 the slowdown in demand related to the general economic downturn and high oil prices is becoming increasingly evident
3410548 consumers clearly are reacting by a change in driving behavior
3410549 the main driver will still be demand from the developing world where consumer are somewhat shielded from rising prices by government subsidies
3410550 el club catal n esta negociando la contrataci n del base estadounidense
3410551 the addition of brian strosser as a vice president and the launch of this new division is just the first of many new initiatives we have planned
3410552 our customers data protection and management needs storage security and engineering support are expanding and it is vital we are positioned to meet that demand
3410553 no red carpets no ranks of paparazzi and no designer evening dresses entry to the films will cost you 3 or a tray of home baked cakes and the audience will sit on beanbags

3410555 for instance the first phase is characterized by the question how can we eat the second by the question why do we eat and the third by the question where shall we have lunch
3410556 youre hot and tired and somebody just pushed a little bit extra on the pile and now you want to get a little get back so you push back said gaither a third year eagles veteran describing how a training camp fight is usually sparked
3410557 at that point its blah blah blah in somebodys face and then everybody starts pushing later on you laugh about it in the locker room
3410558 we have had some fights this camp but i think its because of the intensity of our practices we hit more than most teams and i think that has something to do with it
3410559 i think they serve a purpose when fights happen it shows you that the guys there arent just going through the motions when youve got guys going after it when theyre intense when guys are trying to get better on every play you get fights i like those fights
3410560 were not boxers were here to play football id rather you get the number get back in the huddle and then somewhere along the line take care of the number fighting doesnt do anything for me im not going to keep a guy because hes a good fighter
3410561 but things are going to happen i understand that theyre hot and tired and irritable but theyre wasting their energy its not impressive
3410562 you want them to be physical and when its hot outside like that sometimes tempers flare as long as it doesnt get out of hand sure it can be useful it changes the monotony of practice it picks everybody up gets everybody excited and theyre talking and it generates some energy
3410563 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3410564 the reader who has no interest in dogs boys or oedipal conflicts of the north woods of wisconsin will nonetheless find these things irresistible
3410565 we are concerned about the fact we do not have full stadia
3410566 we think it is due to the weather the humidity and then the rain and on the first couple of days there were not many spectators who showed up
3410567 typically this is stuff kids can do thats why i wanted to try this test first
3410568 in a nutshell i think motorola may have hit the bottom and is now on the rebound

3410577 its a very emotional thing to have a person walk again when theyve been paralyzed
3410578 its very rare to make a full recovery because the spinal cord is a very sensitive part of our body and any injury to it is basically permanent i think hes a very lucky man

3410589 wird der betrieb eines eigenen rz in betracht gezogen ist es wichtig eine vision zu entwickeln und diese w hrend der gesamten planung und umsetzung im auge zu behalten
3410590 essenziell ist zudem nicht die technisch perfekte detaill sung anzustreben sondern auf eine optimale abstimmung der einzelnen elemente zu achten
3410591 in our view the offer price is low and does not consider the growth prospects or margin improvement opportunities for the company

3410598 she looked so fragile and tiny like a little girl lost
3410599 she is meant to have all these pals as part of her entourage but sometimes she just seems to be small and alone
3410600 obviously people around her think she needs close watching and that a bit of help is needed when she comes out of the house
3410601 it was a really fun thing alex turner had these songs he thought would be appropriate for me to sing on
3410602 we recorded it a while ago but weve both been so busy so i dont know if itll come out
3410603 it cant be the right environment for a bloke who has just spent two months battling booze
3410604 he said he needs to clear his head but how can he do that by banging it
3410605 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3410606 i love it when elected officials stand up in front of their constituents and boast that we can and should hold them accountable to their campaign promises
3410607 take hillary clinton for example in 2003 i called her office repeatedly to challenge her stance on the war that didnt work so i got myself hired in her office as an intern had a few face to face conversations with her and senior staff about our foreign policy still nothing
3410608 two years later as her former intern i called a press conference to demand she stop funding the war long story short i spent the afternoon in jail and she voted to authorize funds for the war the next week
3410609 all this to say that making our elected officials actually represent us is no easy feat
3410610 that is why i am coming together with 999 999 young people to sign onto the power vote
3410611 we want to make sure that the new president knows that he has the support to take immediate and decisive action to address climate change
3410612 our demands are not just about more recycling centers and bike to work days
3410613 those are our demands and both candidates have a long way to come to please us but we think that if we build this voting block a million strong they will have the undeniable support and mandate to join us
3410614 we are finding there is an increasing appetite for british comedy shows in the us as cable channels acknowledge the growing appeal with young american audiences
3410615 state elections systems have shown signs of stress and theres a serious concern that they wont be able to handle the number of voters
3410616 when you get so many new registrations like that at record numbers its very difficult for people to monitor the validity of it
3410617 we dont have a real history in the last 10 to 15 years of large scale voter fraud
3410618 what we do have a problem with is getting everyone on the rolls and making sure their votes are counted
3410619 state and local parties have the primary responsibility for monitoring local voter registration and identifying problems
3410620 our view is that advance monitoring of legal developments can avoid real legal problems later on especially on election day
3410621 were all for getting people involved in the process and getting them to the polls
3410622 what were not for is registering fake people at fake addresses and creating barriers to trying to identify voter fraud where it exists which is everywhere its a growing problem because of the professional vote fraud denier industry
3410623 then as now with his national campaign for the president barack obama has always worked to inspire individuals to exercise their right to vote he sees that as a key to his victory this fall
3410624 i would feel more optimistic about a bright future for man if he spent less time proving that he can outwit nature and more time tasting her sweetness and respecting her seniority

3410629 we feel that the use of the word retard throughout the film 15 or more times is done without any regard for the dignity of people with intellectual disabilities
3410630 the caricatures of people with intellectual disabilities are you know almost hateful and we want this to be the beginning of the end we want this to be the end of hollywood treating this population as the butt of jokes

3410635 sandy has told me that she had a lot of historical information about sheridan that dates back to the 1800s
3410636 this is the same rate we paid him last year
3410637 we had to have board approval for the pet because this was the first one for us
3410638 were not sure when they will be repaired because the ground has to be completely dry
3410639 we have to talk to the school board about this but we thought we should first get your permission it will be a little bigger than last years because we want to get the district more involved wed even like to get sheridan grade school involved maybe with a float since they will be high schoolers one day
3410640 well need to know if youll be needing extra police barricades and what streets you might need blocked you should talk to police chief chuck bergeron before you come back to us next month so that well have all the information we need
3410641 will set the tone for each day of the convention
3410642 it is quite a fair result we think because of his age
3410643 we would have been worried if it had been anything less but the judge did the right thing
3410644 although this does represent good progress against the 6 target we do recognise there will be seasonal variation and continuing challenges if we are to be able to sustain this improvement
3410645 we will be looking for a report by november this year on how you are performing against projections and your confidence in meeting the target
3410646 despite being given an easier target than other health boards to cut staff sickness nhs 24 failed to achieve it
3410647 it is simply not good enough for the health secretary to order a progress report into nhs 24s efforts to cut staff sickness
3410648 it is time for a review of the provision of 24 hour care in scotland and it should begin urgently
3410649 this is simply not a time for politics as usual

3410699 clark gregg who directed the movie knew that id written

3410708 when you come to the olympics you represent more than yourself
3410709 you represent your family your town your country just to be here and have my parents karen and dave in the crowd and my sisters and brothers back home supporting me is great
3410710 it is the same game i played with my sisters in the backyard its the same game i watched my sisters play in college it is the same game i have played for years so that is why when i hit the turf i feel comfort because that is where i have always been and that is where i am meant to be now it doesnt mean it is always going to smell like roses on the turf but being so far away from the usa the field has become home
3410711 but we are disappointed that we didnt put our best effort on the field we need to regroup a little bit

3410715 he jumped over mr li and was at one point fighting back
3410716 if it wasnt for him there could have been a lot more of us that never got off that bus
3410717 he made the ultimate sacrifice so that everyone else could get off and everyone else could live
3410718 right when he pulled out the knife he had looked at me first before leaning over to stab tim

3410721 freshwater preached his christian beliefs about how the world began discredited evolution and didnt teach the required science curriculum the board says he was told to stop teaching creationism and intelligent design but he continued to do so an investigation found
3410722 the allegations against mr freshwater are very serious this is not about his personal bible on his desktop it is about the totality of his conduct
3410723 it allows attackers to do anything malicious on any mobile device
3410724 by combining the vulnerabilities with the series 40 issues one could develop malware which could be simply deployed and that malware wont be visible to the user
3410725 at least one from each major family in the series
3410726 there are six long months of work in this research
3410727 some will be against this and some will be for it
3410728 they have a choice whether they want to sign up for our security research or whether they want to devote research engineers of their own to investigate the vulnerabilities
3410729 this is the first time that such a widespread and critical attack has been demonstrated against nokias series 40 devices
3410730 we have proved that these devices can be hacked and infected with malware in a very similar way pc computers are
3410731 but in time people will be able to judge on their own whether we got it right

3410756 i dont like the way that person looks lets get him
3410757 if redemption is to have any meaning in our state there must be times when the rehabilitation of a prisoner is acknowledged and held up as a model for other prisoners this is such a case
3410758 we are known as the scouts and we are both the eyes and ears of the command and task force
3410759 a large portion of our mission is counter improvised explosive device operations if we are flying in direct support of ground forces our mission entails searching for ieds
3410760 we start off our day by checking out the log books and performing thorough pre flight inspections of the assigned aircraft and the back up aircraft
3410761 troop c also known as carnage troop fly the latest oh 58d kiowa warrior which is primarily operated in an armed reconnaissance role in support of ground troops
3410762 attention in the toc o and i brief todays mission is bandit recon alert warning and guidance is the following
3410763 pilots are briefed on the five ws who what where when and why in respect to the operations portion of the brief the crews receive instructions on what the ground commanders want along with any changes in procedures or radio frequencies pilots receive any changes in battlespace and updates as to what friendly forces are in the area of operations
3410764 we find patterns and trends the enemy might be engaged in like ied small arms fire and emplacements we give the pilots an assessment so they know what to look for how the enemy might act and what to expect
3410765 once we complete the o and i brief we return to our command post to conduct a thorough brief on what the responsibilities are for each aircraft those being the lead and trail
3410766 we also discuss possible courses of action should we encounter any problems
3410767 the right seat pilot is the primarily eyes out and concentrates on air traffic avoidance the right seat directs the flight with regards to where they are going and what the priorities of reconnaissance are
3410768 the left seat co pilot manages the sensor and operates both the navigation system and communications within the aircraft
3410769 the lead aircraft is the primary shooter and navigator the trail aircraft covers the lead
3410770 the trail also acts as a second pair of eyes should the lead aircraft take fire
3410771 there are two methods of interacting with ground forces the first method involves area or zone recons when we are not dedicated to a specific unit but in turn we provide area surveillance in support of the ground battalion commanders intent
3410772 if we are dedicated to a ground unit it is usually a company troop or platoon size element when we make contact with these small units the unit commander whether he is a company commander or platoon leaders lets us know what the mission is and from there we can establish a task and purpose
3410773 the ground guys get excited when they see us fly over their convoys we often hear them over the radio or watch them wave from their positions
3410774 our presence gives the ground forces confidence and increases their sense of security because they know we our out there looking for ieds and bad guys
3410775 yeah it was hey why dont we have a nice hot bath

3410784 the big secret in life is that there is no big secret what ever your goal you can get there if youre willing to work
3410785 a person without a goal is like a ship without a rudder
3410786 goals theres no telling what you can do when you get inspired by them theres no telling what you can do when you believe in them and theres no telling what will happen when you act upon them
3410787 if you want to reach a goal you must see the reaching in your own mind before you actually arrive at your goal
3410788 youve got to get to the state in life where going for it is more important than winning or losing

3410808 the iucn red list of threatened species reveals that some large species like humpbacks have seen numbers increase
3410809 it is a political question and it will be answered in a political form
3410810 i think it is really important to stress that the red list is not about whether a given species can be exploited
3410811 its simply about looking at the status of these animals and giving people some idea where they are now in relation to where they used to be

3410818 the judges entire analysis of what is tiffanys responsibility with respect to the site versus ebays starts from an incorrect basis
3410819 based solely on their generalized knowledge that trademark infringement might be occurring on their web sites
3410820 the fact of the matter is ebay has created the venue ebay is profiting from the venue ebay absolutely controls the venue
3410821 its ebays obligation once it has knowledge to take the knowledge to investigate and stop the sale of counterfeit merchandise
3410822 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting

3411126 soc put logic alongside memory on the same chip but have had to compromise on performance since both were fabricated with the same process by putting the memory devices on top of the logic devices using separately optimized processes besang is increasing density without compromising performance
3411127 the cost of besangs 3d chips should be cheaper because you reduced the overall chip area by putting all your logic in one process on the bottom wafer putting all of your memory using a different process on the top wafer and using the conventional vias to interconnect them

3411142 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3411143 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3411144 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3411145 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3411146 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3411147 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3411148 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3411149 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

3411152 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3411153 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3411154 they are extremely close a number of members of the hollywood community including brad pitt ben affleck and matt damon offered to help raise funds for barack but it was with george that he struck up this amazing affinity
3411155 responsible financial institutions and businesses worldwide are taking steps to avoid doing business with iranian nuclear and missile entities as well as with the front companies and cut outs the iranian regime uses to disguise its activities
3411156 these five nuclear and missile entities have been used by iran to hide its illicit conduct and further its dangerous nuclear ambitions
3411157 that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong
3411158 believe under the surface that 20 years sitting there with goddamn america would make him unelectable by itself

3411176 of course you can you saved my life its a small token
3411177 im knackered budge over dominique dragged me to no less than seven robe shops today
3411178 i never should have asked dominique to go with me shes a shopping fiend all i wanted was a new dress but she dragged me into store after store first for the dress then shoes then potions and cosmetics then i needed new underwear i dont know whats wrong with what i already have
3411179 like anyone is going to see my knickers and dont make that face
3411180 all evidence to the contrary i am a girl and do have girl bits
3411181 have you ordered yet i havent eaten since noon and im famished
3411182 no i was waiting for you didnt think youd be here this early
3411183 right with you five tends to mean twenty after hence my surprise
3411184 what you wanted to do this year for the prank
3411185 the prank im so sorry scorpius i completely forgot about that ive just been so busy with everything
3411186 yes we do ill be damned if i let fred and james best us in this
3411187 are we planning on involving good ol corny in this or is it just a general school wide prank do we know who the head girl is or are we playing it by ear oh i should have brought a quill and notebook with me
3411188 depends on what we come up with imogen dogberry looks like it for now and
3411189 i could try to flag down a barmaid if you want
3411190 i think it would be easier to just order at the bar do you want anything
3411191 might be better if i go seeing as how youre currently boxed in
3411192 would you get me a bacon sandwich with chips oh and a pint
3411193 i was about to send a search party for you
3411194 i just remembered my dad asked me to go the bank for him
3411195 more like ten minutes you know how the goblins are
3411196 how do we know which ones are the boys and which ones are the girls
3411197 most wait until their peafowl grow tails but ive asked a specialist to come by next week to do the necessary genetic testing
3411198 good bring the bowls over to the pens while i gather up the chicks
3411199 your father tells me you werent chosen as head boy
3411200 you didnt and why not youre on the quidditch team involved in several clubs and your father assures me your grades are excellent
3411201 i know but the headmistress has this whole system she likes to choose two from different houses each year to make sure they all receive a fair representation a slytherin was chosen last year so i knew i was out of the running
3411202 theres this girl ive liked her for months maybe longer but i havent told her how i feel
3411203 youre a good looking bloke you just need more confidence
3411204 well id hope you would have more finesse than that and more sense
3411205 you know this girl you know what she likes what she doesnt use that knowledge impress her woo her
3411206 if she feels the same way you should have no trouble prying her away from this other wizard
3411207 if i had naughty books i would share with you
3411208 be nice if we could still dock them house points wouldnt it
3411209 my dad has the same book had it for years
3411210 he tried to use it on my mum back when they were in school
3411211 not really but ive looked through it same tosh as youd see in witch weekly compliment her often touch her arm when you talk show that you listen by repeating key phrases stuff any idiot would know already
3411212 not that its a bad idea or anything im sure its worked for loads of wizards just look at all the testimonials on the back
3411213 no one its theres no one i dont even know why i bought it
3411214 er hanging around the castle probably blowing off my homework why
3411215 want to go to hogsmeade with me we could go to your uncles shop maybe get a few ideas for the prank
3411216 we could ask my uncle for ideas i know he helped fred and james with a few pranks
3411217 and we could stop by botwids bevy of books and pick out better reading material
3411218 both together and separately what characteristics do they all share
3411219 what elements in them made them work was it the ones where we relied on physical humor the ones where which were just mind games if we can figure that out then maybe we can get ideas for this prank
3411220 i think we first need to figure out what our best pranks were before we try to figure out what made them work
3411221 your third year prank on james and fred where you paid everyone in gryffindor to call them john and frank for a day
3411222 it required little effort a lot of the humor was found in their reactions but
3411223 your fifth year prank on corny where you spent a week convincing him he was shrinking
3411224 you were the one who gave me the idea you told me how your mum turned herself into some cat like thing when she grabbed the wrong hair for her polyjuice potion
3411225 youre lucky he didnt kill you and drag your half formed carcass into defense against dark arts as an extra credit project
3411226 scorpius malfoy is a stupid gitface who shouldnt be allowed around polyjuice potion
3411227 i know still its been two weeks into the school year and he hasnt bothered us yet
3411228 like i said before we dont have to get him involved most of our ideas dont include him at all
3411229 i think that would be better it should be about the whole school anyway
3411230 do you want to head over to botwids fred mentioned there were some good books there on pranks and practical jokes magical and muggle
3411231 given that we were in a joke shop where your cousin works and this same cousin knows our fondness for pranks i dont see how that is so hard to believe
3411232 since when do you get to tell me to do anything why do you have a bug up your bum about this
3411233 it was before which is why i didnt want you to ask he started gloating about how wed never top them but oh hed be happy to help the younger generation hes such a prat
3411234 so i guess you could say were using their ideas against them yeah
3411235 yeah youre a real crack up why dont we go look in that aisle now
3411236 kind of putting the carriage before the aethonon but all right
3411237 hume regan is a notorious thief and lena morgan is the auror determined to bring him down
3411238 in a voice closer to her normal one she snorted
3411239 she laughed at the thought even the dowdy clothes she wore to go undercover could not conceal her generous curves why do they never think to use polyjuice potion those curves had not gone unnoticed hume stepped forward and boldly wrapped one arm around her tiny waist her full breasts heaving against his broad chest blah blah both perfect specimens of wizardom boring
3411240 a small moan escaped humes lips as her fingers encased his love wand
3411241 love wand though the best ive read was one book that had several unfortunate puns about riding his broom
3411242 i thought you said youd share your naughty books with me have you been holding out on me
3411243 hey scorpius whats up havent been waiting there long have you
3411244 lily can tell you more here ill let you in
3411245 corny was threatening to shut down the party because it promoted lewdness and disorderly conduct so she slipped some uninhibition potion in his pumpkin juice during dinner
3411246 actually i was looking for rose roxanne said i should ask you
3411247 shes not in hogwarts she skipped out to meet duncan in muggle london theyre spending the night there
3411248 yeah well she likes roses so i er grew roses for her
3411249 i could hold onto it if you want rose will be back in the morning
3411250 please dont bother getting up you wont be allowed until the ritual is complete
3411251 son we have discussed this your pet will need to learn his place for the year of servitude which he will serve his place is kneeling at your feet when not in motion
3411252 father he doesnt understand yet can we not allow him to at the very least have basic knowledge of the contract before we go any farther
3411253 harry this is a contract between your father and myself
3411254 you may have one half hour to read it however when you complete your review you will realize that you belong to my son for the period of one year you were placed with your aunt and uncle to learn servitude once the ritual is complete you will remember the additional training learned as a child and during your summers that is now suppressed
3411255 harry our parents decided that since my father saved james potters life during the first war the wizards debt would be repaid with your seventeenth year beginning tonight at midnight you and i will be master and pet you will live with me serve and service me you will live within my life at the end of the year you will be released from the bond to continue your life
3411256 but aside from that i believe that your father owes me a wizards debt himself so can i use that to terminate this contract
3411257 no mr potter you cannot however i do acknowledge that it is true i do owe you for my life at some point at the conclusion of this contract we will discuss it further for now please drink some tea and read the contract
3411258 you will lose your magic your magical holdings and your name you will be the last potter and be treated as though you had never existed your friends will not remember you your life as a wizard will be forfeit
3411259 i believe there are a few things to work out because i do not wish to forfeit my holdings or my magic i will agree to this contract
3411260 however i do believe that there are certain things upon which i must insist one i will not call you master in public unless i choose to
3411261 you must once the ritual is complete we will spend every night together to renew the bond that one is not negotiable however i will not force you to take the same subjects as i do so you will have some time without me
3411262 three you and i will be forced to consummate our bond apparently often
3411263 but you cannot embarrass me with sexual acts or innuendos in front of other people unless i am willing
3411264 and four you cannot whore me out to anyone i expect this to be a one on one relationship between the two of us you cant go off with any of your girlfriends or boyfriends for a quick shag or blow if i am off limits with my cock so are you
3411265 i agree but if you and i both want to involve others together we can
3411266 we will be closed saturday 8 16 08 we will resume our regular hours on saturday 8 23 08 and be open 11am 4pm
3411267 i was standing next to you when he said it
3411268 theyve been gone since the wedding and then they apparate into bills garden with a dead house elf and a live goblin
3411269 ah yes is he still the most sexually frustrated teenage wizard in history
3411270 has she spotted that rons uglier and stupider than harry
3411271 yeah i think its know it all miss prefect or nobody for our ron
3411272 i know what you mean lost the thrill of the chase fleurs cousins were far too easy
3411273 i wonder how many of the twelve ways would be fail safe with muggle girls
3411274 its not like im going to meet any imprisoned at my aunts
3411275 did you meet any when we were in london then you keeping secrets
3411276 one of us had to be in the shop all the time you went out on your own too
3411277 only as far as quality quidditch to check the results
3411278 but you agreed that witches are too easy theyre no fun any more
3411279 i should have told you years ago makes it harder now its just that were supposed to be identical
3411280 i know i cant pretend to be you any more when mum catches me nicking biscuits
3411281 do you want to tell me about the one wizard in particular
3411282 we will be closed saturday 8 16 08 we will resume our regular hours on saturday 8 23 08 and be open 11am 4pm

3411411 if it was anyone else wed be stringing them up by their neck but no its bobby dee and the folk process
3411412 who cares what you think punk you dont even have a name
3411413 this is an issue of having community leaders come to an agreement

3411425 certainly women arent their strong suit but the daughter in american a destructive force but shes also very human shes not nice but shes very real
3411426 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive
3411427 maybe i can get you on charlies show you and one of the patriarchs
3411428 in an even more dire situation than the active army but both have the same symptoms i just have a higher fever

3411440 it feels to me just like a natural step for us to take
3411441 its always exciting to shake things up a bit and to grow and to do things differently
3411442 weve been challenged at the newsstand recently which is an industry wide trend and the decline pretty much mirrors where we are vis a vis our competitors
3411443 our technological innovations allow our reporters to be at the center of more breaking news events and developing stories across the united states with greater independence and mobility than ever before
3411444 this expansion is a critical component of cnn worldwides overall strategy for increased content ownership

3411468 southern african development community sadc leaders should make it clear to mugabe and zanu pf that a resolution to the crisis can only be reached if his government acts immediately to end human rights violations
3411469 instead of focusing on quick political fixes president thabo mbeki and other sadc leaders should look for a durable solution and that means first of all an immediate end to human rights violations
3411470 they beat me like a dog political persecution of opposition activists and supporters in zimbabwe
3411471 hundreds of mdc activists who fled the violence in the weeks before the june 27 run off remain in hiding while war veterans and youth militia continue to terrorise villagers in the rural areas
3411472 if the government of zimbabwe fails to initiate these measures sadc should consider excluding zimbabwe from any future summits and meetings of the regional body
3411473 the president thanks you for your untiring fight your strong fight to restore constitutional order
3411474 has made it his habit to pull our country out of gridlock

3411476 today marks the 10th anniversary of the al qaeda terrorist attacks on u
3411477 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
3411478 my country is in self defense against russian aggression russian troops invaded georgia
3411479 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
3411480 we thought lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama
3411481 its a great honor that my teammates chose to vote for me the opening ceremony is the best day and the best moment of olympic life
3411482 im here as an ambassador of my country and i will do everything i can to represent my country well
3411483 this is another amazing step for me in celebrating being an american
3411484 there is no reason for outrage the man was a rapist
3411485 if we had the death penalty here there wouldnt be so many crimes
3411486 were concerned for the precedent that the execution may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country
3411487 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3411488 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3411489 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3411490 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3411491 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3411492 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3411493 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3411494 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3411495 un chilo di pasta costa un euro e provvede al pasto principale di 5 persone mi dica cosaltro si pu mangiare oggi con 20 centesimi chi spara sulla pasta dovrebbe sentirsi un po ridicolo
3411496 che vuoi che sia un euro in pi al giorno
3411497 t he u s dollars recent rise is largely attributable to market expectations of a bottom in u s short term interest rates coupled with a diminishing likelihood of further ecb tightening
3411498 we are going to look back with a similar bemusement at the pound trading at 2 10 and the euro above 1 60 and the australian dollar near parity with the u s dollar
3411499 i dont think people have bought into the idea that the dollar is in a longer term trend upward against the euro

3411502 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3411503 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

3411508 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3411509 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3411510 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3411511 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3411512 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3411513 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

3411517 saying our 50th state is somehow foreign does a great disservice to the hard working patriotic americans who call hawaii home for months people have been asking me when is sen obama going to come home im so glad he found time to visit his sister and his grandmother show his daughters more of his home state and relax a little hawaii is a great u s destination just ask the 5 5 million americans who visited last year for business and pleasure
3411518 parents horrified as most violent video game ever to launch on family friendly wii
3411519 nintendo will dramatically transform wiis image with the release of ultra violent video game madworld
3411520 it seems a shame that the games manufacturer has decided to exclusively release this game on the wii
3411521 i believe it will spoil the family fun image of the wii
3411522 i hope the british board of film classification bbfc will view this with concern and decide it should not be granted a classification we need to ensure that modern and civilised values take priority rather than killing and maiming people
3411523 wii appeals to a wide range of audiences from children and teenagers to adult and senior citizens anyone from 5 95 as such there is a wide range of content for all ages and tastes available mad world will be suitably age rated through the appropriate legal channels and thus only available to an audience above the age rating it is given

3411550 there are six long months of work in this research
3411551 some will be against this and some will be for it
3411552 they have a choice whether they want to sign up for our security research or whether they want to devote research engineers of their own to investigate the vulnerabilities
3411553 this is the first time that such a widespread and critical attack has been demonstrated against nokias series 40 devices
3411554 we have proved that these devices can be hacked and infected with malware in a very similar way pc computers are

3411560 tsmc is committed to offering high quality silicon proven standard cell libraries to enable customers to design at 40nm technologies
3411561 this is my first marriage but as i understand it they assign a priest to us we meet once a week for a few months and we talk
3411562 what marriage is what it involves whether were ready whether were compatible
3411563 what marriage is hes a priest hes never been married
3411564 well thats why we have to see him all summer dont worry they give him worksheets or whatever down at the home office
3411565 we have to take a test what if we fail the test
3411566 i presume they arrange a better marriage for each of us and baptize you
3411567 true or false i appreciate my spouses wit is a question on the test
3411568 its jim and holly we spoke on the phone earlier
3411569 for people who are supposed to have faith and love their neighbors
3411570 who the hell are you to tell me how to live my life old man
3411571 finally found someone who can put up with me ha ha
3411572 it is always so wonderful to see two people coming together i understand from talking to our secretary that you jim are a lifelong catholic while you holly are lets see lutheran
3411573 is that okay i heard that might not be okay
3411574 oh its no problem at all people outside the church have a great many misconceptions about supposed rules and restrictions but in fact mixed marriages are quite common
3411575 in a few weeks you will have to sign some documents promising to raise the children catholic but im getting ahead of myself first things first everyone focuses on the flowers and the deejay and whatnot but the most important thing any wedding needs besides the priest of course is two official witnesses do you have anyone in mind for your maid of honor and best man yet
3411576 we sure do although not all of them are catholic either
3411577 instead of one of those weddings with nine bridesmaids where you leave half your friends out and leave the other half with ugly dresses we decided wed just let all our friends enjoy the party and go with an all sibling wedding party and jim just has a sister so
3411578 the best man actually has to be a man as a rule
3411579 well i wouldnt want to break such an important rule but it would be a shame if we had to get married out in the parking lot
3411580 now now now it wont be necessary to marry outside the church
3411581 i will just need to do a little bit of research me one week oh im having lunch with a fellow who specializes in canon law on thursday i will ask him okay yes i will ask him
3411582 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work
3411583 billsinsider com is a great website bills fans are unbelievably rabid and knowledgeable good stuff
3411584 some of the guys tease me but i just say yall would like to be like this
3411585 its obvious that they want to use this as evidence for the guernsey court to continue extending a freeze on a bnp paribas account belonging to my client
3411586 we see the accusations as defamation against my client so we have decided to counter sue
3411587 it is not going to happen obasi is here until the end of the olympics
3411588 we are aware of some pressure but obasi is here for the olympics and will conclude the assignment with nigeria
3411589 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3411590 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3411591 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3411592 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3411593 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3411594 what was thought to be a safe transit route doesnt look as safe as a few weeks ago
3411595 and the anxiety is not likely to dissipate when the crisis ends
3411596 a new iron curtain is descending around the periphery of russia any chance of a new non russian pipeline out of central asia and into europe is pretty much dead
3411597 russia has demonstrated that its military is a force to reckon with that it can defeat a western trained force and that the west and nato will not act to intervene
3411598 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3411599 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3411600 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3411601 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3411602 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3411603 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3411604 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

3411617 we are concerned that incumbent wireless carriers are seeking unnecessary and unprecedented testing delays to prevent new innovative competitors from entering the market
3411618 we are concerned that unnecessary interference testing would needlessly delay this auction and that this constitutes the very rationale to kill this effort totally we urge you to carefully consider the existing precedent before making your determination
3411619 for consumers the interference will be extensive widespread and unpredictable significantly degrading their service
3411620 in essence theyre gaming the system to make rules so that a new broadband competitor doesnt appear
3411621 any new entrant especially one that appeals to consumers because the price is disruptive is something they want to kill or delay
3411622 to have any relevance they have to stick to this

3411629 the reconstruction has been frustrating the government missed an opportunity to show it could do things well

3411639 natos decision to withhold a membership action plan for georgia might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia and i urge the nato allies to revisit the decision
3411640 e xpanding nato would be the most fateful error of american policy in the entire post cold war era such a decision may be expected to inflame the nationalistic anti western and militaristic tendencies in russian opinion to have an adverse effect on the development of russian democracy to restore the atmosphere of the cold war to east west relations and to impel russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking
3411641 i wasnt saying that we should go around and declare war
3411642 i was saying that we nations of like values and principles and belief in democracy and freedom should make efforts to modify the behavior of other nations
3411643 what area of american international policy would you change immediately as president
3411644 id institute a policy that i call rogue state rollback
3411645 i would arm train equip both from without and from within forces that would eventually overthrow the governments and install free and democratically elected governments
3411646 i am convinced that he will pose a threat to our security
3411647 i think the united states should inaugurate a 21st century policy interpretation of the reagan doctrine call it rogue state rollback in which we politically and materially support indigenous forces within and outside of rogue states to overthrow regimes that threaten our interests and values

3411657 wherever we find them we will arrest them and bring them to justice
3411658 no i dont think aslan would do that i think hell still help us get there but if we would have listened and paid attention the first time he would have made things easy for us things are hard now because we ignored his guiding the first time around
3411659 weve been saying youre missing a great opportunity to get more of your people in here to celebrate your games
3411660 i would want to stress how important it is for the host city that the venues are seen to be full and everybody has the opportunity to enjoy the festivities
3411661 we have taken this up with organizers and the politicians
3411662 they have promised an improvement today and further improvement tomorrow we hope this is going to take place we need more people to have a higher atmosphere
3411663 when i went out there was a small trickle of people walking through
3411664 access is difficult and security is incredibly tight at some venues its surprising when there have been sellouts and you see quite a few empty seats at the stadiums you need warm enthusiastic crowds to help create an atmosphere for athletes to perform at their best
3411665 i just went to volleyball and it was absolutely rocking
3411666 if they find that there are not enough people or if they find too many empty seats they will organize some cheerleaders who are volunteers
3411667 whether it was food on the dinner table or playing sports outside
3411668 when you come to the olympics you represent more than yourself
3411669 you represent your family your town your country just to be here and have my parents karen and dave in the crowd and my sisters and brothers back home supporting me is great
3411670 it is the same game i played with my sisters in the backyard its the same game i watched my sisters play in college it is the same game i have played for years so that is why when i hit the turf i feel comfort because that is where i have always been and that is where i am meant to be now it doesnt mean it is always going to smell like roses on the turf but being so far away from the usa the field has become home
3411671 but we are disappointed that we didnt put our best effort on the field we need to regroup a little bit
3411672 it was just great work ethic by our captain kate barber
3411673 you could see she had the fire in her eyes
3411674 we came away with one point which is better than none but we wanted three in this game we just have to work on things and hopefully well execute better next time
3411675 it was one of the most amazing things ive ever seen
3411676 i think it proves that nothing is ever really impossible no matter how long the odds seem
3411677 this is one of the events i feel ive improved the most in over four years
3411678 i felt good about things coming in as good as i could feel
3411679 the officers shot twice in the air and three times in the direction of the vehicle which ended up stopping
3411680 he and jeff holguin fourth place finisher both joined the army with the anticipation to at least try out for the army marksmanship training unit located in fort benning georgia
3411681 four of them train every day together and theyre all top shooters they push each other
3411682 the fact that theyre pushing each other on a daily basis has a great bearing on it
3411683 to change behavior mental behavior and physical performance behavior it takes a lot of repetitions
3411684 its got a pretty similar look to this the beijing shooting range with trees in the background
3411685 having them here and finally winning a gold medal for them was incredible
3411686 you cant dwell on hit targets or missed targets because theres nothing you can do in this lifetime about it you have to train yourself to walk away from that kind of thing and he does a very good job at that
3411687 we thought after the second round he had the opportunity to break the record but it was pretty tense after he missed the first round of shots
3411688 i really wasnt thinking about finishing third i was thinking about finishing first
3411689 to even have a chance i had to hit them all i just had a rough start in the finals there were a lot of good shooters out here and they shot better than me today glenn shot well
3411690 the tidal wave is sweeping the country even his own former allies are now voting against him
3411691 this is no time for confrontation and we want to strengthen the democratic process thats why we have decided to support the impeachment motion
3411692 we had our annual memorial day bbq the usual uninvited bugs came out in force we decide to try out the bug bam products we recently received within moments the annoying pests were gone the product did its job and what my guests and i also appreciated was how easy to use this all natural product is
3411693 in oklahoma we have mosquitoes the size of small sparrows i never heard another complaint after the bug bam arrived
3411694 not only did bug bam work it alleviated some of our main concerns regarding the insect issue the prevalence of malaria and the evening inundation of insects into our one man tents
3411695 a livello psicologico c un probabile effetto immediato un aumento dellincertezza sui mercati e di conseguenza una salita della quotazione del barile nel breve termine
3411696 se gli usa per ritorsione dovessero tagliare limportazione di greggio o gas potrebbe derivarne una crisi di relazioni molto seria dando una spinta potente ai prezzi con effetti traumatici sul portafoglio dei consumatori
3411697 non direi purch il ritiro delle truppe georgiane dallossezia porti alla fine della guerra e non ci sia lescalation se il conflitto finir presto limpatto della crisi georgiana sul prezzo dei combustibili rester limitato
3411698 ce ne sono tre inquietanti ma remoti il primo una risposta dura della diplomazia occidentale il secondo unestensione del conflitto con lobiettivo di ribaltare il governo georgiano la terza ipotesi che la russia provochi la secessione dellossezia cos da accelerare lingresso della georgia nella nato la conseguenza sarebbe una contro rappresaglia russa in termini di prezzi delle materie prime energetiche
3411699 abbiamo avuto un finale di settimana con una ripresa di fiducia nel dollaro e questo trend potrebbe continuare ma stiamo comunque parlando di eventi choc per il mercato che riguardano una delle relazioni strategicamente pi importanti
3411700 s sono ragioni politico strategiche la volont di punire loccidente per il kosovo la determinazione a ristabilire il potere di mosca sui suoi storici confini imperiali un segnale duro contro unespansione della nato troppo vicina ai confini di casa
3411701 latteggiamento di mosca verso le compagnie petrolifere dipende dai rapporti con i governi i governi britannico e americano sono considerati non amici e infatti shell e bp in russia hanno grossi problemi al contrario con governi amici come quello italiano le relazioni resteranno buone a meno di cambiamenti di linea diplomatica del presidente berlusconi verso lamico putin che ritengo improbabili da questo punto di vista i consumatori italiani possono stare abbastanza tranquilli
3411702 sono due mondi agli antipodi la russia un paese rentier che vive sulla rendita di posizione delle materie prime ed incapace di creare uneconomia competitiva e di attrarre investimenti esteri paradossalmente solo uno choc al ribasso dei prezzi energetici potrebbe salvarla dal declino innescando un processo di riforma altrimenti impensabile
3411703 e anchessa lontana dalla piena democrazia ma ha saputo creare la macchina della crescita per fare affari ha un bisogno vitale di mercati aperti e di relazioni pacifiche
3411704 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3411705 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3411706 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3411707 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3411708 the south africa government said these camps would be temporary pending the implementation of a comprehensive integration plan such a plan has not been devised or implemented
3411709 if it the deadline isnt extended our clients will be rendered homeless and vulnerable to further xenophobic attacks

3411718 a second half surge could come at the expense of what will be purchased next year
3411719 those interested in buying equipment in the first quarter will push it back to the fourth quarter for the tax advantage
3411720 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3411721 clearly this is a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3411722 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions
3411723 what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3411724 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3411725 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended
3411726 like gastro esophageal reflux and bipolar disease osteopenia began to inflict millions when a drug to treat it came on patent
3411727 now i have to tell myself what my state is

3411749 she never behaved like a chief executive and her own staff proved to be her achilles heel what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from any specific decision she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency

3411776 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3411777 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3411778 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3411779 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3411780 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3411781 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3411782 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3411783 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3411784 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3411785 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3411786 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3411787 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3411788 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3411789 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3411790 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3411791 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3411792 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3411793 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3411794 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3411795 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3411796 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3411797 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3411798 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3411799 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3411800 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3411801 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

3411808 combined with bosch rexroths strong position on specific markets where were not represented today we will have a good position for continued strong growth
3411809 the acquisition of h gglunds drives expands our industrial hydraulics portfolio and significantly strengthens our position in growing markets such as renewable energies and raw materials production

3411831 we see little to stop google from reaching 70 percent market share eventually the question really comes down to how long could it take
3411832 we believe that search is a natural monopoly business and expect that over time google will continue to gain share until they have effectively reached 100 percent
3411833 over the last two years google has gained 50 basis points of share month in the u s and 60bp globally we expect these share gains to accelerate as declining scale makes it more difficult for competitors to justify the technology investments needed to maintain search result quality

3411857 the opening ceremony is sending the same message then as the games architecture cultural and technological leapfrog the water cube and the birds nest dont simply display chinas modernity they claim a jump into a digital sustainable mega scaled future the computational aesthetics of multiplicity that mark these structures are again like the opening ceremony a powerful cultural narrative coherence strength and beauty made of countless tiny pieces like the flickering grid of the drummers the ordered diversity of these structures is important too in that its not total uniformity a simple modernist grid in fact these buildings contain a kind of post industrial grid where the uniformity or regularity is not literal or material but procedural or computational the computers ability to resolve complex distributions of force is what enables the organic multiplicity here
3411858 the stark videos of brandon morse present the viewer with exercises in tension set tableaux in which structures morph and twist under physical constraints stripped down architectural forms that ought to exhibit the rigidity of highrise buildings instead engage in a tug of war the result of a string simulation distributing kinetic force through a network of nodes
3411859 these photographs and now subsequently sculptures all started with underground military bunker formerly krystals restaurant florida i saw this completely benign closed down fast food restaurant and it hit me like a brick that this was the total intersection of all of the thoughts about development economics and that feeding into the paranoid worlds of security and fear in this country today deciding to unleash the restructuring of the photograph the manipulation the compression of space whatever you would like to call it seemed to fit right in with the adapted and mis read histories that each image contains

3411894 the people talking stuff like that do they know i was for two months hurt last year i didnt play for two months and i was down in rehab

3411897 if you have a slow start you need to get to the second half and try to go strong
3411898 i dont have nothing to prove ive already done my job you can check my numbers with all the third baseman in baseball right now and you can see for yourself
3411899 i dont care what people say people talking about that can kiss my butt thats what i say people dont say that i was going to hit 20 home runs people didnt say kevin millar was going to hit 20 homers they didnt say aubrey huff was going to hit 300 what are they going to say now

3411904 ive never played singles at the olympics so this has been really cool for me

3411906 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3411907 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3411908 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3411909 i played really clean matches in the past the next one would be kind of streaky i dont want to do that any more i just want to keep playing the same consistency
3411910 i felt like any time that i needed to serve well i did if i was down love 30 or a 30 all point

3411963 the path of freedom you have chosen is not easy but you will not travel it alone americans respect your courageous choice for liberty and as you build a free and democratic georgia the american people will stand with you
3411964 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3411965 unacceptable the new code word for mutually assured self destruction
3411966 before there was a purple revolution in iraq or an orange revolution in ukraine or a cedar revolution in lebanon there was the rose revolution in georgia bush said to the cheering crowd in tbilisi three years ago
3411967 your courage is inspiring democratic reformers and sending a message that echos across the world freedom will be the future of every nation and every people on earth
3411968 first georgian troops should return to their initial position and be partly demilitarised second we need to sign a binding agreement on non use of force
3411969 i repeat now what i said several days ago namely that russia has historically always been the guarantor of the security of the peoples of the caucasus he said
3411970 this is our mission and our duty we have never been just passive observers in this region and never will be
3411971 i have said that our tactic with regard to the georgian leadership which unleashed this aggression is that of enforcing peace in accordance with the united nations charter he said
3411972 we consider this tactic absolutely effective and the only possible option
3411973 soul bush knows so well added this via the pr team
3411974 i dont think russia will feel like talking with mr saakashvili after what he did to our citizens it is not in our tradition to topple anyone or put someone on a throne the bet thing would be for him saakashvili to resign russia has no plans to force anyone from power this is not in our political culture at all
3411975 if we have received the order to ceasefire this does not mean that we have stopped all actions including reconnaissance
3411976 i am quite impressed with the level of security in place
3411977 it is another matter to satisfy and improve the confidence of key players
3411978 pakistan has been given the all clear to hold the champions trophy the first ever in this country

3411980 it is subject always to monitoring of this event by this taskforce theres nothing new
3411981 i think probably my most memorable experience and probably most important was still montreal and i think that will still reign over this olympic gold
3411982 in montreal it was very difficult it was still fresh after athens and i was still feeling a little bit hurt and still a little bit low
3411983 i just made some major changes to move from my coach ken wood to stephan widmer and it was still really difficult
3411984 i think i was still searching for myself and was still finding my self worth and to believe in myself as a person
3411985 i think because i found out so much about myself and after athens i learnt so much and that was my first individual world championship that one is still more important to me that this
3411986 olympic golds are important but in terms of personal experience in terms of personal growth i think that was my most important win
3411987 it has been a long journey it has been a long eight years and there was a lot of relief that the training was definitely worth it
3411988 my journey has been fun i think it has been a good story
3411989 i think this gold medal is probably for the believers and the people that i guess have stuck by me
3411990 its hard at the time to deal with criticism and i sure did cop a lot of it after athens and i think a lot of it was a bit of a misunderstanding
3411991 it has made me a much stronger person and i think it has made this performance much sweeter
3411992 i was probably tearing up a bit behind the dais and i just got through it and once i saw my mum i lost it
3411993 its hard not to those are the people that see you every day and they are the people that go through the hard days when you are throwing up in your front garden
3411994 it probably is a big weight off my shoulders and it probably is a bit of a relief
3411995 we advise everyone to stay off the ground because you can be evicted and also face heavy fines
3411996 its for the safety of both players and supporters we would say to everyone stay off the ground
3411997 im sure it will happen but to what magnitude im not sure
3411998 its tradition and im sure a lot would remember the jason dunstall days and just run out there
3411999 im pretty sure that at least half the cheer squad would jump the fence and run out
3412000 because i run it ive got to try and do security in the cheer squad but in saying that i cant hold everybody back
3412001 conditions involving everyones safety including people who run on the ground is an issue so we would be encouraging people not to do it
3412002 obviously we have to make plans in case some people decide to do it
3412003 one would hope people wouldnt jump the fence and be silly
3412004 there is a substantial fine if people enter the playing arena hopefully the public will respect the security presence because you dont want any of them to be hurt or any of the players
3412005 but if a few do jump the fence we will go into a security and police procedure just to make sure the players and officials are safe on the oval
3412006 maybe it s b c of google s nutty idea to use solar and wind energy to be green just use fossil fuels like the rest of us you twits

3412272 our technological innovations allow our reporters to be at the center of more breaking news events and developing stories across the united states with greater independence and mobility than ever before
3412273 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3412274 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3412275 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share

3412283 the russians are lecturing us the chinese are lecturing us europe is lecturing us
3412284 you know the golden rule he who has the gold makes the rules we used to go around telling countries how to run their affairs because they needed money from us and they had to listen and its now becoming the same with us only listening is not anywhere near as fun as telling other people what to do
3412285 and dont forget weve been peddling our toxic mortgages around the world i mean thats our great export of the last 5 years
3412286 it makes sense to me to say to the world that we are going to use new technologies to explore for oil and gas in the united states offshore oil anwar oil shell projects ok hes not even making sense now to help change the psychology to send a clear message that supplies of oil will increase

3412291 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3412292 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3412293 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3412294 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3412295 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3412296 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3412297 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3412298 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one

3412303 there is no question it would take quiet a bit of time for this to come to the market
3412304 but it was the same argument that was used any time over the past ten years that it would take too much time for this stuff to have an effect having a couple million extra barrels on the world market would eventually help ease those markets

3412309 with his strong bond in the african american community in chicago barack has been able to express his beliefs in a community drenched in religion we find god together as a people and barack brings that faith perspective in finding god in the community
3412310 i dont want to go to a club and not wear panties
3412311 i just think for too many people celebrity becomes a way of life instead of a job but i think the thing for me is that i prefer the quieter things in life
3412312 this is in the national interest it is the image of our national music national culture especially the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important extremely serious matter
3412313 we made the decision that the voice we would use was yang peiyis the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3412314 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in the aspect of voice yang peiyi is flawless
3412315 we had been through several inspections they were all very strict when we rehearsed at the spot there were spectators from various divisions especially a leader from the politburo who gave us his opinion it must change
3412316 i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi that is to say we have a perfect voice and a perfect image and representation in our teams view combined together
3412317 adults may lie but leave the kids out of it

3412360 i can copy him but i dont think i could be as good as phelps
3412361 theyve been resting all week and just gearing themselves up for one race where every time michael gets up on the block he has to gear himself up for his performance that night or that morning

3412363 our target is win the gold medal now is the time to fight for that
3412364 im delighted by the three goals i the second time in the olympics
3412365 the important thing is that my goals helped brazil to win
3412366 the defense left a loose ball in the air and i took advantage of that mistake and tried what we call a half bicycle kick and i was lucky it went in

3412383 didnt play her best in the last game were glad she found her shape and scored three goals today
3412384 while there is never a good time for an injury the timing of this was especially disappointing considering it forced me to miss the british open and it comes in a ryder cup year
3412385 i was telling myself im not going to fall off this horse
3412386 but i know sasha there are so many naysayers out there who say sasha crumbles under that kind of pressure but i know better
3412387 i was like that is ridiculous that i finally put it together like that
3412388 it was probably the greatest competition of my life and you couldnt ask for a better time
3412389 knowing that takes a little of morgan and paul out there with me
3412390 the key was taking it out of the realm where he feels like hes out there all by himself
3412391 the point was this teams going to love him no matter what im going to love him no matter what hes not out there by himself and we have his back no matter what

3412397 manchester united made an offer for david silva but this has been turned down by valencia
3412398 his family are settled and if he was to move it would only be to another spanish club like
3412399 we didnt have the vocal leadership that we have now
3412400 ive developed a lot in that way theres a lot more communication on the court now
3412401 even though carmelo dwyane and lebron were two years removed from athens they were still young
3412402 but the big thing that summer was we learned a lot about ourselves and the international game we missed a lot of free throws they had a five or six minute stretch where they hit every shot and that cost us the game
3412403 in retrospect it was a blessing just not when it happened but i look at it as another part of the growing that needed to be done
3412404 tasha is a versatile rookie post that can shoot the three and score in a variety of ways her game resembles that of and she has the potential to develop into the best power forward in the league

3412406 we dont rely on dr thaksins money when manager mark hughes makes a decision we go through the normal process which can include banks finance or a whole bunch of different things just like any other club

3412408 i must apologise again for deciding to come to live in england if i am fortunate enough i will return and die on thai soil just like other thais

3412411 the three british soldiers were evacuated to a military hospital where one of them sadly died from his wounds
3412412 our thoughts and condolences are with his family friends and comrades
3412413 it is with deep regret that we must announce that a soldier from 16 signal regiment has died and two more from the same regiment wounded in a suicide attack on a vehicle patrol in kabul afghanistan
3412414 we denounce this heartless act and i offer our condolences and sympathies to the families of those killed and injured
3412415 this attackers target might have been isaf soldiers but he only succeeded in proving the insurgents utter disregard for the lives of the afghan people
3412416 acts such as this will not deter isaf in our commitment to help afghans create a better afghanistan
3412417 get them the f out as quickly as possible without causing a boatload of mayhem and death
3412418 do you really believe there are one million terrorists and nothing has blown up in the us since september 11 2001
3412419 therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife and the two shall become one flesh this mystery is profound and i am saying that it refers to christ and the church
3412420 teach me your way o lord that i may walk in your truth
3412421 lord i cannot know your way unless you show me
3412422 he tacitly contrasts the ways of god with all the counsels which he could derive from carnal reason in submitting himself to god and in imploring him to be his guide he confesses that the only possible way by which we can be enabled to live a holy and upright life is when god goes before us while we follow after him
3412423 teach me your way o lord that i may walk in your truth
3412424 let what you say be simply yes and no why is jesus making this point
3412425 if you help me clean the yard tonight ill take you for ice cream on sunday
3412426 on the second one not only were they offside but they interfered with me
3412427 from day one no matter how many albums or tickets me or anybody else that does real country music has sold or awards theyve won it seems like youre always secondary or nashville is always apologizing for real country music and always trying to broaden their appeal by changing the style of music that has always bugged me
3412428 that mini cd was included in near half a million boxes of garnier nutrisse hair
3412429 he who cant stand drivel like this would mark prize package return
3412430 you have heard that it was said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
3412431 but if anyone slaps you on the right check turn to him the other also
3412432 blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account 12 rejoice and be glad for your reward is great in heaven for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you
3412433 how perfect expected and fortuitous not to mention profitable that tijuana bible evolved as the go to moniker for pornographic mod texts
3412434 not that you need catchy names to move porn but anything sexual with the name tijuana attached to it assured that the consumer would be confronted with some beastly swarthy over the top sexual witnessing that would leave them ready to empty their gonadic profits onto sheets tissues sheep or worse
3412435 and if anyone would sue you and take your tunic let him have your cloak as well
3412436 for you are great and do wondrous things you alone are god
3412437 our father who heaven hallowed be your name your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven
3412438 and this is eternal life that they know you the only true god and jesus christ whom you have sent
3412439 why would you spend time in prayer telling god about himself wouldnt it stand to reason that if he is god he already knows
3412440 sharpen our thinking by learning to express the reasons why god should answer our prayers affirmatively
3412441 good and forgiving abounding in steadfast love to all who call upon you
3412442 gracious and merciful slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness
3412443 there is none like you among the dogs o lord nor are there any works like yours
3412444 since there is just one god then all religions lead to that one god after all all religions basically say the same thing
3412445 thats what a lot of democrats think of his policies anyway
3412446 sweetheart i hate to tell you this sweetheart they just heard the toilet flush
3412447 its not me im sitting at the desk in her bedroom theres another member of my family who i will not mention but were very close apparently she is using the facility now she just said to me the next sound you will hear is the shower this is not an enormous place we have in stamford but its nice
3412448 therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife and they shall become one flesh so they are no longer two but one flesh what therefore god has joined together let not man separate
3412449 it was also said whoever divorces his wife let him give her a certificate of divorce
3412450 why then did moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away
3412451 when a man takes a wife and marries her if then she finds no favor in his eyes because he has found some indecency in her and he writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends her out of his house and she departs out of his house and if she goes and becomes another mans wife and the latter man hates her and writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends her out of his house or if the latter man dies who took her to be his wife then her former husband who sent her away may not take her again to be his wife after she has been defiled for that is an abomination before the lord
3412452 well why did god allow this if hes so against it
3412453 because of your hardness of heart but it was not so from the beginning
3412454 but i say to you that everyone who divorces his wife except on the ground of sexual immorality makes her commit adultery and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery
3412455 you have heard that it was said you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy
3412456 you have heard that it was said love your neighbor and hate your enemy
3412457 well the surrounding nations couldnt be my neighbor they worship false gods and we worship the one true god they offer abominable sacrifices they arent my neighbor
3412458 they arent my neighbor they are half breeds with jewish blood mixed in with assyrian blood i wont even walk on samaritan soil
3412459 well we are the religious leaders the intelligentsia of israel everyone looks up to us we are special we cannot consider the common riff raff our neighbor
3412460 love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you
3412461 hate your enemies and get revenge on those who persecute you
3412462 to the place where the actual bones of the apostle st james are enshrined in that silver reliquary
3412463 may they blush for shame therefore those envious people beyond the mountains who claim to have some part of it or possess relics of it
3412464 there is nothing so powerful as truth and often nothing so strange
3412465 again you have heard that it was said to those of old you shall not swear falsely but shall perform to the lord what you have sworn but i say to you do not take an oath at all either by heaven for it is the throne of god or by the earth for it is his footstool or by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king and do not take an oath by your head for you cannot make one hair white or black let what you say be simply yes or no anything more than this comes from evil
3412466 for people swear by something greater than themselves and in all their disputes an oath is final for confirmation
3412467 again you have heard that it was said to those of old you shall not swear falsely but shall perform to the lord what you have sworn
3412468 you shall not swear by my name falsely and so profane the name of your god i am the lord
3412469 if a man vows a vow to the lord or swears an oath to bind himself by a pledge he shall not break his word he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth
3412470 if you make a vow to the lord your god you shall not delay fulfilling it for the lord your god will surely require it of you and you will be guilty of sin
3412471 you shall perform to the lord what you have sworn
3412472 if make a vow or taken an oath swearing by gods name then it is permissible and you have to honor it but if you swear by any other name or by anything else it could be broken
3412473 but i say to you do not take an oath at all either by heaven for it is the throne of god or by the earth for it is his footstool or by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king
3412474 and when you pray do not heap up empty phrases as the gentiles do for they think that they will be heard for their many words 8 do not be like them for your father knows what you need before you ask him
3412475 woe to you blind guides who say if anyone swears by the temple it is nothing but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple he is bound by his oath
3412476 the central problems of this region are about the dark politics of ethnic revival and territorial struggle the region is home to scores of brewing border disputes and dreams of nationalist homelands

3412504 in writing this book i found myself with uniquely compelling material to work with
3412505 this film was a fascinating chapter in our nations recent cultural history when it exploded onto the national stage in 1988 it set loose a series of questions about the politics of religion the rights and responsibilities of the entertainment industry and the publics willingness to tolerate artistic explorations of a widely revered figure i think that today we are still dealing with the aftereffects of this controversy

3412512 desde que tengo uso de raz n me recuerdo interpretando enga ando a mis padres o intentando conseguir algo por medio de dotes interpretativos

3412525 asked in elkhart ind by a 7 year old little girl why he wanted to be president barack obama answered because i dont believe that america is what it could be or what it once was and i dont want that for my little girls parsing his statement he doesnt want our america for his little girls because he doesnt believe it is what it once was on that point i agree with him albeit for completely different reasons america today is in jeopardy of no longer being a nation in which ordinary families can pass their single greatest source of wealth i e their property to their children and future generations whatever portion of said wealth isnt taken by the federal government through onerous death penalty taxes is threatened by the governments abuse of the take clause of the fifth amendment and or state and local governments that routinely overstep their boundaries under the guise of eminent domain america is no longer a nation where honest law abiding citizens can depend on the courts to protect their rights and privileges over those of criminals in fact today the rights of honest patriotic citizens are abridged and abrogated in favor of the extreme the unpatriotic and the hardened criminals home and business owners are all too often told they cannot display our national flag or flags that commemorate prisoners of war and or those missing in action consider states like vermont where the courts routinely favor the freedom of pedophiles and sexual deviants over the safety of children america is no longer a nation where children are free to openly give thanks to god for their meals in public schools even cadets in military academies are being forbidden same today businesses like tyson foods disallow long standing national holidays such as labor day choosing instead to honor muslim holidays as if america should be beholding to same america today is no longer a nation where her sovereignty is honored illegal aliens are not to be called what they are but rather undocumented immigrants illegals are permitted to wage protests intended to cripple our economy they are given sanctuary in violation of federal laws while those local municipalities that take steps to curb the economic burdens caused by illegals in their communities are forbidden by to act liberal courts america today is no longer a nation where true freedom of speech exists rather there exists a proscribed politically correct speech that is deemed acceptable based on codified dictates
3412526 obama has absorbed the barbiturates sic of hatred class envy redistribution of wealth and government control so extreme are the levels of said anti american toxins in his core being its doubtful there exists picrotoxin in sufficient supply to save him and the country from his political poisoning should he win the presidency when he says he doesnt want that for his little girls is he saying he doesnt want a country for his daughters where a person of color or a woman can be president is he saying he doesnt want a country where they like he and his wife can be educated in the best institutions of learning in a country where they can be wealthy as the old adage reminds us a leopard cannot change it spots nor can it conceal them for very long obamas true colors are being exposed more clearly every time he speaks the problem is that his spots are not red white and blue they are not supportive of american values and they certainly arent supportive of the constitution as written and originally intended when a presidential candidate says we americans cant drive our suvs and cannot eat as much as we want and cannot keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect that other countries are going to be okay when he states emphatically that this will not be the case under his leadership i submit that we can conclude what kind of country he believes america could be the problem is thats not the kind of country our founding fathers envisioned nor is it the kind of nation a majority of americans want to live in

3412551 many years ago when i was a college student i took a course from john kenneth galbraith on the first day of class professor galbraith gave a brilliant opening lecture after which the students gave him a standing ovation galbraith kept on giving brilliant opening lectures the whole semester but instead of standing ovations there were now dwindling numbers of students and some of them got up and walked out in the middle of his lectures galbraith never got beyond the glittering generalities that marked his first lecture after a while the students got tired of not getting any real substance senator barack obamas campaign this year reminds me very much of that course from professor galbraith many people were ecstatic during the early primaries as each states voters heard his glittering generalities for the first time the media loved the novelty of a black candidate with a real chance to become president and his left wing vision of the world was largely their vision as well there was a veritable media honeymoon for obama there was outrage in the mainstream media when abc anchor man charles gibson asked obama a serious question about the economic effects of a capital gains tax who interrupts honeymooners to talk economics the fact that senator obama did not have a very coherent answer made things worse for charles gibson since obama can do no wrong in the eyes of many of his supporters they resented gibsons having asked him such a question the question incidentally was why senator obama was advocating a higher capital gains tax rate when experience had shown that the government typically collected more revenue from a lower capital gains tax rate than from a higher rate
3412552 politically what matters to the left wing base that obama has been playing to for decades is sticking it to the rich what effect that has on the tax revenues received by the government is secondary at best what effect a higher capital gains tax rate will have on the economy today and on peoples pensions in later years is a question that is not even on senator obamas radar screen the kind of talk that won the votes and the hearts of the left wing base of the democratic party during the primaries may not be enough to carry the day with voters in the general election so senator obama has been changing his tune or as he puts it refining his message this was not the kind of change that the true believers among obamas supporters were expecting so there has been some wavering among the faithful and some ups and downs in the polls despite an impressive political machine and a huge image makeover this year to turn a decades long divisive grievance promoting activist into someone who is supposed to unite us all and lead us into the promised land of change little glimpses of the truth keep coming out the elitist sneers at people who believe in religion and who own guns the americans who dont speak foreign languages and the views of the typical white person are all like rays of light that show through the cracks in obamas carefully crafted image

3412596 it was cecilias idea to apply the technology to wine
3412597 when she spoke with people in the industry they would tell her they needed a quick way to determine the components of a wine without having to send it off to a lab
3412598 it should even be able to identify say a chardonnay regardless of whether it was grown in france or california
3412599 you could use it to verify that a wine was made from the proper grapes
3412600 for example there are only five authorized grapes for a rioja but lots of winemakers sneak in cabernet anyway this could help enforce the standards
3412601 this is a way for them to verify a vintage
3412602 wine is one of the most complex chemical substances out there and no human palate can quantify its makeup objectively this kind of electronic device can
3412603 the human palate is unable to detect that a wine is say 20 merlot a device with a full range would be an awesome tool for explaining the mystery of what goes into a wine
3412604 this kind of device is purely technical its the human palate that determines whether a wine is worth drinking

3412697 some iphone users are having trouble getting a 3g connection and hanging on to it hiccups reportedly include a high incidence of dropped calls switching onto the slower edge network while the device is stationary and loss of reception while in good coverage we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain infineon is the 3g supplier
3412698 the problems are likely to be embedded in the low level software and the chipset
3412699 at amp ts 3g network is not ubiquitous currently at amp t offers 3g service in only 300 major metropolitan areas it expects to get to 350 metro areas by the end of the year by contrast at amp ts 2 5g edge network which is what the first generation iphone uses is deployed throughout at amp ts entire nationwide footprint

3412722 we are pleased with our results for the second quarter which reflect an ongoing integration of fushi and copperweld as well as our continued ramp in production we continue to see strong demand for all of our product lines and are beginning to realize opportunities to broaden our target markets not only geographically but also in terms of market segments which we believe will increase our revenues over the long term while mitigating the risk associated with a narrower focus we have significantly bolstered our sales efforts through the hires of several seasoned sales executives with substantial experience not only in the bimetallic market but importantly in the end markets we plan to serve we believe that we have taken the appropriate steps to ensure our position as a dominant player in the bimetallic industry through domestic and international sales marketing and manufacturing expertise branding and technological innovation
3412723 while we have historically been focused on capturing revenue from the telecommunications market we believe there are substantial new opportunities in other underpenetrated market segments we expect that telecommunications will remain a strong contributor for us and expect this segment to continue to grow sequentially but look for other market segments to begin to increase as a percentage of sales we have already seen this trend beginning and expect that it will continue on a larger scale going forward we are excited about the revenue opportunities this presents to us and look for this evolution to strengthen our foothold in the bimetallic market worldwide
3412724 we are excited about the traction were gaining in our combined fushi copperweld businesses and we are anticipating that our increased production capacities combined with our strong branding presence in global markets will allow us to generate significant new sources of revenue looking ahead to the third quarter we recognize the external factors that can affect our business from time to time and we are well prepared to manage through them we are building our business for the long term benefit of our shareholders and believe in the long term potential of our strategy we expect the coming quarters will be a time for strengthening our foundation to capture the benefits in 2009 of our efforts this year on behalf of our shareholders
3412725 we are encouraged by the increase in our same store net operating income despite lower same store sales as expected our investment in new stores in houston dallas and st louis added additional revenue and operating expenses which contributed to the loss in the quarter and six months we may continue to operate at a loss and our cash on hand may decrease as a result of the early operating losses at the new stores until they achieve the test volume necessary to break even we are working extremely hard with our new store projects and look to improve on our results going forward

3412740 weve become very dependent on foreign oil a lot of it from people who dont like us very much at some point in time we are going to run out of oil thats why we need to be developing alternate sources
3412741 i think we need to maximize our oil production in the united states we know there are proven american resources in addition to that we need to be looking at other technology we need to look at ways to build refineries in the united states we havent built a refinery since the 1970s and not just in the gulf area where a hurricane can come along and wipe it out we also need to produce nuclear energy we have hundreds of years of coal reserves much of it right here in the 18th district we also need to do a better job of conservation

3412777 for me it was very difficult because the chinese do not understand this i was lucky because two months later there were the asian games and we won everything so after that they left me alone
3412778 next year you have national games and its more important than world championships next year the national team is finished all the people go back to their provinces for this competition
3412779 when they were both about to leave they had a heated argument outside the restaurant they were doing a good amount of yelling
3412780 they love each other very much and want everyone to know that the matter was completely blown out of proportion
3412781 weve been standing up and fighting for pensioners and retirees in opposition as we did in government
3412782 it will require the signing of a legally binding treaty on the non use of force
3412783 we will be forced to take other measures to prevent any repetition of the situation that emerged because of the outrageous georgian aggression
3412784 my way of improving on it is to keep it up i just want to keep playing the same consistency

3412789 it was one of those spur of the moment things
3412790 in order to become involved with the obama campaign you have to have a connection if you sign up on the web site to volunteer and they dont get back to you its because they have a lot of people with work experience
3412791 its always hard the first time you dont know the right people dont know who to talk to and what meetings to attend
3412792 it seemed perfect i was looking for a bench anyway and i found a way to donate to the campaign
3412793 i didnt realize how young harry and emma were until they brought the bench over
3412794 i used to see cutesy things like kids having lemonade stands

3412817 application of an expert interview system specifically targeted to erectile dysfunction along with a continuous platform for patient client physician communications make this particular internet system comparable to traditional medical practice

3412827 immerse yourself in the future of the trek universe as it moves into the 25th century a time of shifting alliances and new discoveries
3412828 where we are is broadly pretty good for the stage of the electoral cycle it provides us with a good launching pad for the next election
3412829 i personally believe that despite the attempt at enormous spin from the conservative party which seems to be in serious danger of becoming exceptionally complacent and self congratulatory that all the evidence is that we will gain seats at the next election
3412830 most winnable seats and our most marginal seats were all against the conservatives
3412831 so if there is a big swing from labour to conservative then you will find that we will be gaining as many potential seats as we will be losing and i would actually say its very unlikely that were going to lose seats to the conservatives
3412832 although the effects of the iraq war are fading i think that many labour voters want to see a party thats committed to dealing with things in an international way
3412833 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
3412834 the glass cliff evidence that women are over represented in precarious leadership positions
3412835 the athena factor reversing the brain drain in science engineering and technology
3412836 52 of our best and brightest female scientists engineers and technologists are bailing on hard earned careers and not looking back precisely when they should be hitting their professional strides
3412837 women leaders are seriously isolated without mentors or sponsors or the equivalent of the
3412838 i think because of the ruud situation it was an opportunity to once and for all look for a fresh start

3412843 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3412844 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3412845 we said back in october that we would abolish stamp duty for nine out of ten first time buyers
3412846 this was a fully costed tax cut last october so i do not know why the government is still dithering and not getting on with it
3412847 when it comes to the crisis in our housing market they seem intent on making things worse rather than better
3412848 their decision to brief out the possibility of a stamp duty holiday was completely reckless
3412849 one two three four sure are a lot of young white women in this thing
3412850 why do you think they put so many young white women professing their love for obama in what is clearly an anti obama video what would possibly be negative about young white women liking sen obama
3412851 when asked the mccain campaign says they took the video from local news packages but of course that doesnt explain anything
3412852 the older people just dont see obama in these glowing terms
3412853 for older voters a lot of the reservations really have to do with this experience factor while younger voters see in obama something much closer to themselves
3412854 what effect will being on page one have for my business does more traffic equal more conversions
3412855 according to a source in the obama campaign former iowa congressman jim leach a republican will be endorsing democratic presidential candidate barack obama this morning
3412856 no vemos que la pena de muerte inhiba absolutamente a nadie de cometer delito habr a que analizar el tema de la cadena perpetua si no es un tema que vulnere podr amos aceptarla
3412857 los cr menes y la violencia ni os de 14 a os de edad han masacrado a sus compa eros
3412858 la pena de muerte es la pena sobre la pena misma es decir estar amos acudiendo a lo que es la venganza y cu ndo vamos a terminar si t matas a un criminal va a haber un sentido de odio y de venganza y va a ser una cadena de nunca acabar
3412859 after the glasgow east by election no one can doubt that labour is in a deep hole
3412860 this is much more serious than mid term blues which may be expected to evaporate as the general election approaches
3412861 so what types of digging need to stop first is the frantic search for some magic populist policy solution there is no single get out of jail card and it is foolish to believe that such simplistic solutions will do the trick
3412862 indeed some are counter productive inviting the publics contempt by implying a desperation to buy support by ditching unpopular taxes or offering dubious incentives
3412863 dangling the carrot of home ownership in front of low income council tenants in current market conditions for example is a deeply suspect proposition
3412864 just as dubious is the siren call for more initiatives one of the greatest mistakes in government is to confuse activity with outcomes just because ministers feel busy devising 101 new ways of tackling a problem does not guarantee the problem gets solved
3412865 much less clear is the inevitability of defeat the historical parallel is closer to 1990 than 1995
3412866 while the thatcher government was deeply unpopular in 1990 losing the eastbourne by election on a similar swing to glasgow east the electorate had not yet committed to labour as the next government
3412867 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3412868 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3412869 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
3412870 it is not our policy to reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption
3412871 this stance supports our view that a victim of rape is not in any way culpable due to alcohol consumption
3412872 it is never an individuals fault if he she gets raped regardless of how much he she has drunk
3412873 cicas policy is not to make a reduction on a claim for compensation following rape on the basis of alcohol consumption
3412874 the scheme was originally applied wrongly in this case but this was corrected at review and the award was paid in full
3412875 we deal with around 60 000 cases each year there may be times when an original decision is wrong
3412876 this is why we have a review process to allow the applicant to challenge that decision
3412877 i know that there is a huge appetite for read across and everybody wants to see me as the advance guard
3412878 london is meant to be the petri dish into which tory central office is introducing the bacillus of their policies but its not like that at all
3412879 we are developing a lot of new things and i hope they are broadly congruent with things that conservatives might like to do when they get into office
3412880 to a certain extent i think it would have been a dramaturgical cheat not to have had some sort of thing about which people could make exactly the point about incompetence
3412881 it would have been a fraud on the electorate not to produce something and there will be things like that of course
3412882 i think there are things to be done on the venues still and i havent lifted my reserve on that

3412912 its still early days the performances are there and were creating the chances weve got the lads to stick them away in an ideal world youd be winning every match comfortably last season we didnt start all that well but hopefully well start next week by banging the goals in and getting ourselves off the mark since the first game back against aberdeen weve all progressed and got better with every game sundays was a good performance but we want to improve and get better this is one step further in our preparations so im sure well be ready
3412913 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3412914 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3412915 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3412916 people who were hired in an improper way didnt themselves do anything wrong
3412917 well continue to watch them carefully and make sure the response is appropriate
3412918 we have a process that we run continually that just goes back and trawls through work thats been done and does another check to make sure everythings been done exactly as it should be
3412919 the guys have found an irregularity whenever we get that situation we have to make sure we have 100per cent done the work and if it affects an in service aircraft we withdraw that aircraft from service until were sure
3412920 sometimes you check things out and you find its all hunky dory and other times youve got to do some steps
3412921 we run an internal process to make sure we dont get into that territory
3412922 okay we have to win if he keeps us in it

3412934 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3412935 anything that we do to improve safety that we clearly have to do on our own i support
3412936 our action does not preclude the attorney general from making a decision
3412937 this is not a bill that should frighten lawful gun owners
3412938 the vision of the convention is to serve as the collective voice of the music a unifying force joining both fans and industry leaders while promoting the rich variety artistic value cultural and historical significance of tex mex music
3412939 the city of dallas and the state of texas have rolled out the red carpet and have made this fifth anniversary convention a true texas homecoming
3412940 as the economy and housing markets change in pennsylvania and around the country some mortgage companies are using aggressive new tactics to solicit customers
3412941 todays consumer protection lawsuits are an important step to protect consumers from illegal conduct and send a clear message that lending companies must obey the law
3412942 this is the most extensive campaign of telemarketing calls to consumers on the do not call list ever investigated by my office
3412943 using an international call center they invaded the homes of thousands of pennsylvania residents with unsolicited and unwanted phone calls marketing mortgage loans that they were not licensed to sell
3412944 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3412945 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3412946 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3412947 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3412948 jeg er s overtr tt at jeg ikke f r sove
3412949 the ballistic textbooks are very clear on this burning and blackening is a feature of very close range shots probably from less than a foot away if you see burning and soot type burning it indicates that the barrel of the gun was very close to the skins surface
3412950 due to a complaint being filed an investigation was initiated by internal affairs
3412951 in this case the officer is being allowed to work pending the outcome of the investigation
3412952 everything right now is looking on the low side so were not overly concerned about the rain
3412953 we think the streams can absorb the amount of water theyre predicting
3412954 if i have any regrets its not so much the question of the policies but the question of the speed and implementation
3412955 while i defended port hedland and curtin and woomera detention centres did i want to see improvement in amenity well obviously if you look at what happened over time infrastructure that was built we were seeking to do that
3412956 would i have been happier if id had more money to be able to do it sooner and earlier and to put in place alternative detention arrangements for kids yes of course i would have been
3412957 the circumstances about his rendition i think thats the word thats used we were aware that he was no longer in pakistan but were never informed about where he was or what had happened to him and we did make inquiries about those matters
3412958 and my understanding is then asio director general dennis richardson formed a view that thats where he might be but not on the basis of any advice but simply i think on the basis of supposition
3412959 i dont know that asio goes in and second guesses criminal investigations i think paul osullivan asio director general made it very clear that they were making inquiries against their remit and that they had no evidence through their inquiries that he was a security threat
3412960 that was known at the time it was certainly known to me
3412961 but the police commissioner mick keelty had one view based upon the evidence that they had and the evidence that they believed needed to be further examined and the security agents said we have none that doesnt surprise me
3412962 the beneficiary of the australian legal system the capacity to be able to test matters relevant to the handling of him and his circumstances
3412963 the rising cost of providing health care coverage for employees is the number one concern we hear from our member businesses
3412964 the state needs to actively take steps to drive these coverage costs down
3412965 it extends insurance to some low income working hoosiers offers tax credits for businesses with qualified wellness programs and encourages smokers to quit but theres more left to do
3412966 many hoosiers are still uninsured so further options must be explored otherwise those with insurance will continue to see their rates increase to pay for those without it
3412967 this will force smaller businesses to drop insurance programs altogether and lead to less people covered
3412968 what we need to do instead is reward businesses and individuals who take responsibility for their well being
3412969 the number of public houses is going down in total
3412970 theres been a steady growth in the allocations to homeless people they may well be squeezing out other people
3412971 over several years the amount spent on public housing has actually been falling in real terms
3412972 when i hit it from the back i got them mamis saying dammit man when i put it in they mouth i got them mamis saying duh huh huh muhh
3412973 i just dont think its going to do what its meant to do
3412974 theres a real problem that the bigger retailers will be able to spread the risk but at this point independent retailers could be at a disadvantage and it could deliver even less competition over the longer term
3412975 fuelwatch is dead just forget about it its all over
3412976 since petrol prices are driven mainly by global oil prices which will keep trending upwards as we hit peak oil fuelwatch is at best a political distraction from the main game of helping australians reduce our reliance on petrol driven cars

3412978 a more offensive or odious comment would be difficult to find
3412979 he mr cohen was elected after pledging not to tax health services only to betray that pledge because he was asked to by other members
3412980 i know exactly what the analogy meant i have jewish ancestry
3412981 gould was my mothers maiden name and my pregnant grandmother was deported by the nazis
3412982 melbourne is still a business hub but sydney takes the cake when it comes to banking
3412983 i know a few people have moved to melbourne but sydney is the place to be
3412984 im only surprised sydney hasnt always dominated the banking industry
3412985 at this time we do not have the black hawk helicopters with sufficient protection to allow them to allow us to send them into afghanistan
3412986 we would not be able to achieve an ame aero medical evacuation with adequately protected helicopters until almost the middle of next year
3412987 i am concerned about increasing our overall commitment which would mean we could take a lead role in oruzgan from 2010 we already make a substantial contribution
3412988 the information we have obtained is incredibly damaging to the credibility of the government and points very clearly to government failures playing potentially a major role in the explosion on varanus island
3412989 the serious question that has to be asked is if energy minister fran logans department had followed the technical advice they were given would the explosion have occurred at all
3412990 if fran logan had done his job properly is it the case that we wouldnt have had the explosion on varanus island and we wouldnt have incurred multi billion dollars of cost to the west australian economy
3412991 it is important the investigation is allowed to proceed without hindrance and without being a political football
3412992 the 16 inch line of the dual sales gas pipeline has been in operation for almost eight years and the 12 inch sales gas pipeline has been in operation for around 15 years for these periods the record will show that the conditions in the subject licence relating to safety and integrity management have not been addressed
3412993 matter remains outstanding and because of its criticality and significance docep recommends that this matter be brought formally to apache executive management attention
3412994 in other words in april of last year docep was saying to doir weve asked apache to fix this up they havent done it you have to do more about it
3412995 the blockade imposed by israel on the gaza strip over a year ago has left the entire population of 1 5 million palestinians trapped with dwindling resources and an economy in ruins some 80 per cent of the population now depend on the trickle of international aid that the israeli army allows in this humanitarian crisis is man made and entirely avoidable
3412996 i feel like ive got a lot of hair right now and a lot of its up in my face
3412997 i almost feel like my hair has a second life
3412998 since my near fatal hair growth episode im going to be doing things so differently from what i did in my first 64 years that its almost like my hair is living a life of its own and taking me along for the ride now time will tell if thats true thats the way it seems to me for today
3412999 but i feel like ive got a lot of hair right now and a lot of its up in my face
3413000 its almost like my hair is living a life of its own and taking me along for the ride
3413001 he has to take responsibility for his hair or it just wont work
3413002 i think it was very important for the employees to see physically and mentally to see his hair and know that his baldness is recovering and improving
3413003 this van was flying i dont know how fast it was going but it was well over the speed limit in that area
3413004 these two officers are great drivers neither have ever had an accident and both are well trained in high speed pursuits
3413005 when winquist came over the hill he had no idea that decaro was turning around
3413006 the two hit each other and the van got away
3413007 the cars were the two newest cars we had here
3413008 for right now we are going to have to pull community service vehicles and school resource vehicles until we decide what we can do about it
3413009 acho que eles n o imaginavam que o novo batman fosse ser t o grande
3413010 our strong second quarter results reflect continued momentum among our diverse set of businesses
3413011 we are encouraged by the robust revenue growth which we achieved despite the backdrop of a challenging economic environment
3413012 in light of our solid first half results and continued positive sales momentum across the company we are confident in confirming our full year revenue and margin outlook
3413013 we want freedom and we will continue our struggle until we are free
3413014 clear interference in the internal affairs of an integral part of india
3413015 until the kashmir dispute is resolved the anti india sentiments will stay
3413016 its incongruous that in perth consumers with cash in hand are denied the ability to shop or have a relaxing stroll through their local shopping mall on a sunday yet melbourne sydney brisbane darwin and hobart are afforded this convenience
3413017 yes yep but so was john cummings from the independent grocers association
3413018 the shop distributive and allied employees association is one vested interest group which has campaigned to prevent western australians from being able to shop on sundays
3413019 as a result the people of western australia will have to wait longer to enjoy the full benefits of shopping hours reform including greater choice more convenience and lower prices
3413020 ive had a lot of individual commentary to me about that issue more than i anticipated to be honest and i respect those views ive got to
3413021 brayden if you found a purse with no personal identification with cash and a nintendo in it do you really think most people are going to turn it in to lost and found and even if they did what was to stop a restaurant or store employee from taking it
3413022 this has been a good lesson to all of us about putting things where they belong right
3413023 now that you know how it feels to lose something im sure youll be more careful in the future
3413024 in a weird way we can even be grateful to kendrie for messing up your side of the room since otherwise you wouldnt have found it

3413030 il y a louverture de discussions internationales que ces discussions aient lieu
3413031 producers who come to ag progress days have an opportunity to see a wide variety of equipment and products anything from machinery and dairy equipment to animal housing feed seed and fertilizer
3413032 they also can talk to representatives of lenders insurance firms crop consultants and other business services
3413033 it really is one stop shopping which can save farmers a lot of the time and gas that they otherwise would have to burn traveling to different vendors to comparison shop
3413034 in one day they can evaluate models and brands that might not be readily available in their home area
3413035 eighteen of 23 drivers in a jerusalem taxi station have decided to resign after learning that their station is about to be sold to an arab businessman from east jerusalem
3413036 for us this is not a problem but truly a liberation
3413037 i do not have the habit of defending suspected riders and i believe that i have demonstrated this in the case of may and also in those more recently of ricco and piepoli

3413043 weve discovered that we can deliver the product at a fraction of what our original estimates were
3413044 jason while i understand what youre proposing is technically valid you have upset the marketing team
3413045 its just that theyve promised the customer that our product would use oracle 8i and now theyre going to be made liars can you just humor me and add oracle 8i to the design somewhere
3413046 i have enough trouble politically as it is i really appreciate this favor
3413047 i dont think homosexuality has anything to do with this
3413048 el desarrollo de cualquier juego siempre plantea desaf os es la naturaleza de todo lo que debe lograrse dentro de un plazo de tiempo determinado con algo as como pes los retos a los que enfrentamos son poner en marcha todas nuestras ideas en el plazo que hemos asignado y hacer que funcionen
3413049 este a o por ejemplo hemos mejorado los movimientos sin bal n para elevar el nivel de control que tiene el jugador
3413050 hemos implementado nuevos elementos de control que son reforzados con unas animaciones mejoradas hemos trabajado muy duro para garantizar que la animaci n de los jugadores es m s fluida mientras que muchas de las mejoras visuales har n hincapi en la individualidad de los jugadores en t rminos de apariencia y movimiento los movimientos a adidos y los peque os retoques mejorar n tambi n la jugabilidad y realmente no ha emocionado la manera en que mejoran el juego en pes 2009 estas mejoras llevar n a pes 2009 m s all del terreno de juego
3413051 hemos sido partidarios de ampliar los modos de juego en pes 2009 y hemos creado los nuevos convi rtete en leyenda y leyendas para el juego individual y multijugador respectivamente ambos convierten al jugador en uno de los jugadores durante el transcurso de un partido y fuerzan que el usuario pueda adaptar su juego para convertirse en parte de un equipo completo como con la vida real ello requiere una disciplina diferente de juego y cambio de jugadores y permite a varios jugadores jugar juntos online en el modo leyendas
3413052 the documents were seized shortly after the fall of baghdad by kanan makiya an iraq born emigre who teaches at brandeis university and heads a private group called the iraq memory foundation
3413053 rebecca and i are massive fans of the films and when were were planning the wedding we thought why not star wars
3413054 it was a lot of fun after all its not everyday you get to be married by yoda
3413055 the wedding was so informal at the start but obviously when the actual ceremony took place people became at bit more respectful
3413056 the wedding was presided over by yoda who had secured his marriage licence off the internet in the weeks beforehand and the ringbearer was none over than princess leia sporting her famous gold bikini
3413057 you have never seen people more excited to be dressed up in star wars gear everybody totally got into the swing of things
3413058 there was no division of the wedding guests between the jedi and the empire but that would have been a pretty neat idea if we could have done that
3413059 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3413060 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3413061 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3413062 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3413063 an so ein desaster kann ich mich nicht erinnern da kann man sich lieber w nschen nicht an den start zu gehen das steht ewig im lebenslauf der ruderer
3413064 wir sind aggressiv rausgegangen aber dann haben uns die kr fte verlassen

3413075 i have one question for mr karzai if this was your little girl what would you do
3413076 these criminals are never brought to justice because police and government authorities are either involved or they cant handle the crimes
3413077 with criminals and warlords in the political scene we cannot expect justice to be served
3413078 nouzha skalli the minister for family and social affairs is accused of seeking legislation to lower the volume on muezzins in tourist zones newspapers have asked whether skalli a feminist and former communist is trying to curb islam and impose secularism on moroccos overwhelmingly muslim society some hard line imams have cursed her during public sermons
3413079 if we feel the rule has been breached we will invoke it we will not turn a blind eye to issues of a serious nature as always we will take advice from the home office and the foreign office
3413080 i think there is a huge support for eliminating the eighth grade ceremony
3413081 queensland healths contribution in support of gp super clinics comes with a clear expectation that appropriate emergency department patients would be treated
3413082 how will they triage in emergency departments just on clinical need or are they going to triage on ability to pay
3413083 each and every patient will retain their right to attend public hospitals at no cost
3413084 every other young dude was put on were putting ourselves on

3413086 this really means a lot to me especially when you consider i started this business in the attic of my home 27 years ago
3413087 i feel extremely fortunate weve made sound business decisions that put replacements in a position to grow and continue to provide jobs to nearly 550 people at a time when other companies are struggling in todays tough economic climate
3413088 its very clear that it will be much more cost effective long term to expand as opposed to continuing to lease additional warehouse space
3413089 all men have the stars but they are not the same things for different people but all these stars are silent you you alone will have the stars as no one else has them
3413090 we are very pleased by the growth in revenue and gross margin through the first half of 2008 which we believe further validates our operating model
3413091 these improvements in quarterly performance coupled with the greater than 20 000 000 in project backlog gives us confidence in the strength and demand of our business and the services we offer in the marketplace
3413092 we fully anticipate this momentum to continue as we execute on our operating and financial plans for 2008
3413093 with the new 2 2l engine the 2009 g5 is a great looking low priced coupe that delivers fuel economy that pushes it to the top of its segment

3413096 the crime and misconduct commission understands public frustration at the delay in the queensland police services review of the initial police investigation into the death of mulrunji on palm island
3413097 the cmc is also concerned about the delay and has been in contact with the qps on several occasions requesting the final report
3413098 it is a complex matter and it is not in the view of the qps unusual or unreasonable that it has extended over the current time frame
3413099 it is all about projecting the right image of china with no respect for honesty or for the audience

3413110 we will decide who comes to this country and the terms on which they come
3413111 the reason i was appointed immigration minister i think was because in terms of internal social cohesion howard was strongly of the view that he needed somebody who had a track record in relation to immigration and the need for it to be non discriminatory
3413112 it went back to some of the earlier arguments and debates that we had and i think he wanted to put beyond doubt that those issues werent being reawakened
3413113 but there nevertheless was within the community tremendous anxieties people have forgotten the nature of those anxieties but they were exemplified by pauline hanson in particular
3413114 in my view that was flawed the reasons for the anxiety that people had was because over a period of time labor and i think theyre moving in this direction again had allowed the integrity of the migration program to be brought into question
3413115 do i look depressed and anxious at the way in which my colleagues have been described
3413116 the circumstances in which i was placed were matters of fact time and history
3413117 when i was first elected i was having to deal with the remnant boat arrivals that labor had received and the very reason mandatory detention was there up until about 99 or so i was getting chinese boat arrivals back home thats what i was doing and it was about that time 98 99 that the first boats started turning up and you had to deal with it
3413118 border protection is a necessary component of conducting an effective immigration program if you dont have it and people simply turn up unannounced you might as well have no rules
3413119 when you run a program like that and you know its going to be diminished by unlawful arrivals you still have lawful obligations to protect refugees if people are found to be refugees you cant return them to a situation of persecution and so you have a process by which you have to ascertain whether people are refugees
3413120 was i looking for ways and means of addressing those issues
3413121 are there aspects which if you had more resources more quickly you might have been able to temporise a little yes those things could have been pursued
3413122 well it depends on what youd call children in detention
3413123 i was responsible for releasing into the community and putting in place arrangements for essentially fostering into the community unaccompanied minors
3413124 i dont get given the credit for it but when i left office there were no unaccompanied minors in detention
3413125 my view was that the alternative detention regime which was based upon the swedish model where you would keep family units fairly close to where the detention facilities were so that they could meet the principal family member usually the father who would continue to be detained while mum and the kids would live in the community was an appropriate model
3413126 i would simply say that when people have an opportunity to be able to test to the limits to the most superior court in a country the lawfulness of the charges that have been brought and the tribunal or court that may deal with it you are a beneficiary of that system because you are in a position to benefit from the protection it offers
3413127 i think that is a proper use of the word its not suggesting he was benefiting in any particular way because of the fact that he was held its not that at all
3413128 you feel in relation to anybody who loses their life in tragic circumstances the compassion for their family and loved ones
3413129 he had the opportunity to test within the australian system the lawfulness of the decisions that were taken and he was in fact a rejected asylum seeker who had been heard not only by the department but through the administrative appeal process and had the opportunity to pursue litigation and it wasnt as if he was without advice
3413130 the refugee convention is not about accommodating people who believe their lives may be at risk because there are family feuds
3413131 i am strongly of the view that elections are determined by a multiplicity of issues not just one
3413132 in my view the government would have been very severely judged if we were seen not to be able to address the issue effectively of unauthorised border arrivals
3413133 there are some people who would like to characterise me as being the manager of an inhumane detention system that unfairly treated people who were the most deserving in the world and we just didnt recognise it what would i want to say about that what i would want to say is i would hope to be remembered for having put in place the building blocks for australias future the largest and most successful immigration program in australias history since the aftermath of world war ii

3413144 patricia was the lynch pin in the departments efforts to address the needs of the whole person for both the student athletes and the staff she provided significant effort in supplying the resources needed for success
3413145 she was our face to the ncaa serving on peer review committees management council and sport committees as well as the person coordinating our community involvement the main thing about patricia is that everyone touched by her was better for having had the experience
3413146 patricia was a pioneer in womens athletics whether you consider her creativity through the transition occasioned by title ix her leadership in the ncaa and big east or her serving as an advocate at georgetown
3413147 she started working for me as an administrative assistant and through all the positions she subsequently held from gymnastics coach to director of instruction at yates field house to associate athletic director and swa she demonstrated a willingness to take on any responsibility which would enhance the lives of those around her she maintained strong relationships with parents and alumni and served as a confidant and an advisor to students and staff for more than 30 years at georgetown she has helped those around her realize their potential
3413148 on behalf of the university community we thank pat for her service to georgetown

3413150 every police department has limited resources that must be managed and prioritized to best protect the publics safety
3413151 cooperation with other agencies and the resources they bring to the table have never been more important but we need to always keep our eye on the goal of making our communities safe while not sacrificing the rights and protections we value in this nation
3413152 americas local police are unclear about their role and responsibility in the enforcement of federal immigration law and worry that their participation in immigration enforcement undermines their ability to fulfill their core mission of providing for public safety which requires building trust and support in all of their communities police leaders know that without community cooperation their efforts to effectively prevent and address crime are severely compromised
3413153 how do we police a community that wont talk to us enforcing immigration law could be another unfunded mandate and be expensive for local governing bodies police agencies will be challenged by individuals arrested or by advocacy groups especially if there is a perception of racial profiling
3413154 our document management system is a big time saver for kcdc employees and legal professionals who regularly access court records
3413155 before people had to travel to the courthouse where the records were stored or the court had to mail files from one location to another in addition to the time and costs associated with searching for and copying records occasionally the wrong documents were placed in files
3413156 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3413157 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3413158 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3413159 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3413160 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3413161 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3413162 if we can perceive even a flicker of desire for communion in the church a desire also of these children who want to enter into communion with jesus i think it is fair to be more generous naturally of course one aspect of our catechesis should be to make it understood that communion first communion is not an ending event but rather demands a continual friendship with jesus a journey with jesus
3413163 in these sense naturally we should do everything possible in the context of the preparation of the sacraments in order to reach the parents as well and thus make them aware of the journey they are on with the children they should help their children to follow their own desire to enter into friendship with jesus
3413164 if parents have the desire for their children to make their first communion this desire often a social one should be extended to a religious desire in order to make a journey towards jesus possible

3413167 i think john edwards did one heck of a job of packaging his confession of infidelity in a manner that will quickly put the issue behind him as long as there are no other skeletons in the closet
3413168 he left at least two big loose ends that promise to keep the story alive awhile longer
3413169 he offered to take a paternity test to prove hunters child isnt his but the test hasnt taken place and the mother says there wont be one
3413170 hunter reportedly has received payments for some period of time up to 15 000 a month according to one report that claims the payments were hush money to keep her quiet edwards says he didnt make any payments to hunter and that any payments that were made were without his knowledge if she was paid who made the payments and why promises to keep the story alive if any laws were broken the story could become decidedly worse

3413180 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3413181 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3413182 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3413183 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3413184 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3413239 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3413240 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

3413247 it seems like the folks on bondage com are a little more kink lifestyle oriented more of a super niche than alt com
3413248 the competition for these memberships has to be fierce because its a relatively small number of people who are that kinky
3413249 its not like weve had a million new users come in during a day but the traffic definitely keeps increasing
3413250 we find that people enjoy interacting most with people who are already online or were most recently online and actively looking rather than people who havent been on for three years but maybe theyre the most attractive
3413251 with the recent backlash of profile cancellations and link and content censoring from other sites
3413252 our members appreciate being able to express themselves freely and to link freely on their profiles
3413253 so its common to see sites and forums dedicated to one niche within the bdsm and fetish umbrella and every time you niche out your audience gets smaller
3413254 i see personals sites that have some services but not enough
3413255 a fair amount of people told me that when they heard that i was ok about people posting pics of their bruises they signed up because bondage com does not allow them to anymore
3413256 they took away the reason that some people hang out there to show off their bruises and marks its hilarious that a bdsm site wont let you post bdsm pics
3413257 people from alt com and bondage com were posting all over the forums that things were going to get better and didnt they started taking features away they banned me for linking to a site that a guy had listed in his own profile
3413258 the only reason i managed to keep the site going is because people donated money
3413259 it was impressive to see how many americans donated money around christmastime that was really surprising to me i know things arent that great in regard to the dollar right now and theres a possible recession
3413260 i wasnt going after membership revenues but rather the ad revenues
3413261 i have about 10 advertisers now i dont make a lot of money just a little bit the whole point of the site wasnt to make money but to offer a versatile community where people who were interested in the lifestyle could come meet others and learn about the lifestyle
3413262 i cant say weve stolen anyone away from bondage com but there is a lot of negativity about bondage com on our discussion boards
3413263 while bdsm is becoming more mainstream there are still in some regional areas a social stigma associated with it
3413264 so being able to have the anonymity when you first contact someone is important
3413265 i dont think bdsm personals are more competitive than any other niche the problem is bdsm is a more focused niche than others in order to find what you want in bdsm over the years you start to self identify in a niche
3413266 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3413267 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3413268 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3413269 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3413270 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3413271 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3413272 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3413273 not like the writers and producers at motown or quincy jones but he was on that level in my opinion
3413274 he gave me my voice he taught me showed me and nurtured my voice he didnt teach me how to sing he taught me how to be a better singer that was isaac
3413275 he didnt have a choreographer he didnt have a show
3413276 isaac would just get up there and sit down and become one with the song he was doing and you would look out and the women would be hanging on every word it made me wish my voice was that deep
3413277 i met isaac hayes when i was on the road with james brown in the 70s
3413278 we played a few festivals together in my later years i got to know the man behind the music he was the first official black man to be known as a real rapper and he had nothing but praise for his queens and women of the world
3413279 hayes was so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best
3413280 although he was under the weather he was still performing
3413281 he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls
3413282 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure
3413283 isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator
3413284 i tried to be as real as i possibly could
3413285 and i keyed in on the character shaft the character himself
3413286 i think the songs out there today when the kids talk about romance i think theyre too blatant they dont leave enough for the imagination
3413287 i like to use metaphors thats right and take it slow and easy and then build its kind of like foreplay you dont want to get there too soon else its all over its like eating candy just gobbling it down and then i want some more and its gone you have to savor it
3413288 there are things that we did with watchmen that could only work in a comic

3413290 the most disappointing thing the most incredible thing is that nobody caught it
3413291 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3413292 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3413293 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3413294 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim
3413295 the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscars
3413296 movies about the mentally retarded is something we talked about for a long time my grandfather was adopted by a mentally retarded man a man who shouldnt have been allowed to adopt a kid
3413297 when he saw forrest gump you never saw a guy angrier than him it was not such a picnic to be raised by that guy
3413298 the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future
3413299 however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3413300 i lost my mama i went through so much drama i went through so much drama im for obama
3413301 its not a black or white thing its not a rap or rock and roll thing
3413302 its a good music thing we jam about good things from the heart how can you pick between me and trent reznor
3413303 i hope you had a good time f that the time of your life
3413304 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at his wife rhonda
3413305 she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3413306 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3413307 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3413308 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3413309 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3413310 he represented a kind of hood attitude and cultural phenomenon that was under exploited in america but had great potential
3413311 he was always honest and that honesty was what he exuded and what made him so great
3413312 its a terrible loss i mean you need funny in your life at all times he was definitely one who brought it one of the best comedians ive ever really experienced and condolences go out to everyone in his family
3413313 bernie is just ridiculous with it or he was so god bless his family god bless his soul but bernie was that dude for real so rest in peace man
3413314 warped tour was great but we cant wait to get back into venues that actually have roofs over our heads and arent 110 degrees
3413315 touring with the roots was something weve wanted to do for a while and were real excited its finally happening and estelle opening things up its over tour of the year fans are in store for a real special treat who knows whats gonna happen out there
3413316 surprise n a it was bound to happen sooner or later
3413317 yeah i went green and 26s on the hybrid smoke so much green that i cant open up my eyelids
3413318 wake up in london go to sleep on atlanta time still my paint got more candy than your valentine
3413319 trouble i dont shy away from it i annihilate suckas in their driveway in church on sunday morning praying bout what happened friday
3413320 basically were naming everything girls like in a song so when you hear it youll understand exactly what im talking about if you dont know what girls like then im going to tell you in this song im going to let you know exactly what they like just give you a couple points its going to help you with the entire rest of your life thats what its going to help you with for sure
3413321 were in the works of doing a whole lot of very creative stuff
3413322 the whole album every song is a movie thats basically how it comes down i dont even have features on the album the first single is not even featuring chris brown and sean garrett its co starring chris brown and sean garrett thats what i have on this album its all stars basically its co starring people because its a movie every song is a movie creatively and conceptually i think people are definitely going to understand that this is something that was very creatively put together it took a minute but every song is very serious
3413323 basically we make most of our money after 11 so its kind of forced us to close down
3413324 without us playing any music it was like 41 decibels
3413325 thats just background noise we want to go back to the judge and explain thats just the sound of the city
3413326 what ultimately caused them to be shut down is that they werent paying their electric bill
3413327 that came as a complete shock to us we didnt know that was happening at all
3413328 for the last three or four summers weve been going over to europe and doing all the festivals and it looks like we just totally ignored our fans in america but thats not the case as a consequence the american fans miss us and they want their metallica so this will be a good homecoming for them and us
3413329 we were talking to lars and he goes were going to take you guys on tour
3413330 there are very few people driving to this festival its a huge mass transit event and i think that alone must save a tremendous amount of fuel and help from an emissions standpoint
3413331 i think its great how transportation by ferry is being so encouraged
3413332 and they made it really hard to get parking passes so that keeps it green
3413333 the line was so long i was like what is this
3413334 that takes a lot of extra effort and extra money but the artists were very conscious about not throwing stuff away
3413335 were not adding tons of plastic and paper plates backstage but its a small thing and theres probably a ways to go there
3413336 my girlfriend drives a hybrid and i quit turning my lights on when i go to the restroom
3413337 these artists are out there not to beat people over the head but to increase awareness of a lot of different issues
3413338 in a pretty easy way it creates a little consciousness about what happens when you throw it away
3413339 lets pick it all up lets get a little reward for doing so and it will also keep the grounds looking a lot nicer for everyone throughout the weekend
3413340 tomorrow the new record releases its just a really amazing time in our lives
3413341 were so excited were going to go to virgin megastore across the street and wait in line a little bit longer
3413342 we do anything for our fans and we owe everything we have to them
3413343 we cant tell what were performing but it will be our second single
3413344 these monsters had started to eat me up on the inside
3413345 the teachers view the decision to strike as a last resort
3413346 tu sais que cest une fille qui couche rapidement tu sais quelle est bonne au lit
3413347 oh my god i hope her career is tremendous and full of really great work
3413348 american tony is a rapidly growing pharmaceutical company we offer unique traditional chinese medicines combined with elements of western medicine and market our products throughout china we are pleased to be taking the next step in american tonys history by becoming a publicly traded company we look forward to rewarding our shareholders with opportunities associated with our vision of becoming one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in china through acquisitions and organic growth
3413349 this is something major for the streets a lot of people who didnt or who dont normally get love from other outlets can count on ozone to shed some light on them
3413350 after all these years the only award ive ever received was a ozone award
3413351 so i love the show its the third year it keeps getting better
3413352 for us to accomplish that mission we needed to shed a lot of extra baggage
3413353 we needed to focus a little more we needed to make quicker decisions we needed to be ok saying no to certain stuff and we needed to weed through stuff quicker
3413354 one of the coolest things was rick actually suggested that we all stand up and rock out like we would live
3413355 and we did and it put a lot of life into the basic tracking of it all it was almost to the point where when i was retracking stuff i was standing up headbanging id never done that in a recording situation before hes a great song doctor and he has great ears
3413356 the great thing about working with rick is hes never around
3413357 i would say thats a very strong point in that it leaves the four of us to take on the entire brunt of the work and the planning that goes into the songwriting process and the recording process
3413358 bob would add a lot of his own musical input and with that came a lot of his own influences and style and jurisdiction and idiosyncrasies
3413359 and it would eventually make it into our sound but with rick because he wasnt there its almost 100 percent undiluted metallica hed come in and say thats good that isnt change that and we would have to figure that out for ourselves this is the most pure weve sounded in a long time
3413360 rick is not the kind of producer like a bob rock whos there every moment holding your hand making you step up
3413361 rock arranged everything all the time and wore many hats in the studio rick rubin no hat rick comes in and goes well wheres the songs ok thats good thats not so good more of this less of that see you in a few months goodbye and thats what we needed that brutal honesty to get through it and it worked
3413362 the slipknot that he did the system of a down records he did and even the johnny cash stuff where its the essence of him and you hear him you hear whats going on thats what i want i want people to really hear metallica
3413363 so in a way its got somewhat of an older sound songs and arrangement wise weve got a lot more diversity on the record instrumentals fast shorter songs epic ballady moments its quite different from st anger where if youre angry this is your album and if youre not it might take some work
3413364 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3413365 the latest coup in mauritania could never have succeeded without the agreement of america france and israel
3413366 for this reason we warn muslims to be wary of all forms of unbeliever democracy because they are just a ploy by the zionist crusader alliance to trick you
3413367 o people of mauritania you need to get back to islam and and dont hesitate to wage holy war jihad to fight the jews and the christians together with the apostate governments
3413368 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3413369 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3413370 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3413371 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3413372 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3413373 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3413374 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3413375 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3413376 were looking at opportunities up and down the track were bullish on mass transit and we think this area has terrific potential
3413377 there are going to be a whole lot of people working in that area and we want to give them a place to eat and shop
3413378 they gave us a lifetime supply of defeat we used it all up in one beat
3413379 so funky so fresh so fly we live like junior executives

3413385 his public career i suspect has been damaged irreparably as it should
3413386 i think the context and the circumstances and the timing of it and the attitude that he projected during the presidential race i think creates some very serious problems for him in terms of being able to redeem himself
3413387 i am constantly thinking about elizabeth edwards and his children this is a woman who is struggling to stay alive and kids who are seeing their mother struggle to stay alive and now they have to deal with this
3413388 thats a position that he would have assumed simply because his wife was elected president
3413389 always be on time always do your best remember to work hard always be honest strive for greatness go the extra mile theres no gain without pain and most important never give up
3413390 whats going on here how can those who are working so hard be receiving so little while those who seem to be working so little are achieving so much my expensive education hasnt paid off at all and yet that multimillionaire dropped out of high school my father worked hard every day of his life and yet our family had to borrow the money to pay for his funeral why doesnt my hard work pay off for me the way it was supposed to why do so few really get rich while most of us struggle to barely get by what am i missing what do those financially successful people know that i dont know

3413399 we are still psychologically not good enough when we were really going to win a game
3413400 we achieved our goal we tried to minimize the gap
3413401 playing the us was inspirational for us they are the best
3413402 today were not just looking at one of smooth creations pimped out cases but a complete system from them which includes everything from cpu to dvd rom
3413403 no will and no apparent heirs to claim the floor to ceiling stacks of paintings and art works crammed into his one bedroom apartment

3413410 we are pleased with our overall results in the second quarter and feel we have regained some of the ground we lost in the first quarter
3413411 we still have our work cut out for us in the second half of the year as we continue to compete in a challenging demand environment
3413412 the workers on the boat were used as guinea pigs

3413429 misguided and untrue view of sexuality whereby a woman with a dildo is seen as liberated strong and independent while a man with a blow up plastic vagina is viewed as disgusting and perverted
3413430 as i understand it there are no products of good quality on the market for men
3413431 should there be such products specifically for men then there is nothing stopping us from selling them
3413432 its conceivable that the surviving u s financials because i do think there will be continued mayhem in that space and mergers and so on its conceivable that you will see not writedowns but writeups in the next year
3413433 our view is right now that were definitely seeing a slowdown but the u s is continuing its rehabilitation and china will slow but not fall into recession and then europe and japan thats a different story theres a more pronounced slowdown there
3413434 hmm ben really does look kind of like a terrier now that he stopped shaving maybe i should get a terrier but not because it would remind me of ben it would be very strange to own a dog that reminds me of ben especially when its licking my face to wake me up in the morning or when its peeing on a tree in my backyard
3413435 since when in the hell did i owe you anything

3413438 strangers in strange lands the explorations of great french directors
3413439 the films are entirely site specific distinct products of their own place their own time and their creators strong authorial voices yet as each toys with traditional expectations of documentary travelogue and narrative they capture the universal experience of being an explorer a foreigner and a stranger in a strange land
3413440 there is a very active market eager to leverage the unique capabilities of the mainframe for business success
3413441 the conduct then was in the defendants scope of employment regardless of whether it was unlawful or contrary to the national security of the united states
3413442 it will require the signing of a legally binding treaty on the non use of force
3413443 thanks to god and to hugo chavez i have a house
3413444 look what hugo chavez who isnt our president has done for us the corruption here needs to stop because were human beings in need
3413445 the reconstruction has been frustrating the government missed an opportunity to show it could do things well
3413446 they are putting make up on pisco to say theyve done something
3413447 weve done all that is possible the numbers are there to for anyone to investigate
3413448 the anniversary is just a date the rebuilding work continues
3413449 top priority will be given to rescue work and delivering food medicine and other necessities to people in flood hit areas including foreign tourists stranded on national highways and at railway stations
3413450 its pretty clear there is a need for further clarification about the need for assistance
3413451 the government has a very long experience in dealing with these kinds of disasters
3413452 would you like to swing on a star carry moonbeams home in a jar

3413454 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3413455 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3413456 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3413457 people who were hired in an improper way didnt themselves do anything wrong
3413458 in a very challenging retail environment we delivered strong sales merchandise margins and profit increases on top of very strong operating results last year
3413459 web 2 0 things hopefully they will make the functionality pretty simple
3413460 lets not let the truth get in the way of a good argument
3413461 it is standard operating procedure for a judge to order no contact with any witnesses and that can include the family
3413462 because normally the written order controls a careful attorney will make sure its on the record
3413463 one has to assume the true motivation behind this action is to build campaign support for the next gubernatorial election and divert attention away from his own personal issues that may stand in the way of his ambitions
3413464 a violation of the terms and conditions set forth by the court on aug 8 2008
3413465 a film is a very specific and personal account of bill carters experience in sarajevo during the war and we would very much like to make the film here
3413466 this is a departure from the very big hollywood productions
3413467 im not in fact playing bill in this movie but i read the script and the very human story at the very core of this film spoke to me very clearly
3413468 hopefully we can get this movie to be made at the end of this year to come here and shoot would be just wonderful
3413469 theyre coming in having had a cell phone when they were 12 having had a myspace page through high school and theyre used to having things their way
3413470 theyre not making the purchase decisions yet but they will be
3413471 dells laptops probably were stockier than average in the past so it had more ground to make up
3413472 we the undersigned are in favour of creating a ban in which ptbulls will be prohibited from frequenting the dog park located on mackle road in c te st luc
3413473 a dog that has an appearance and physical characteristics that are substantially similar to any of the aforementioned dogs
3413474 one of the more famous cases is one in the supreme court where the challenge was rejected
3413475 and its interesting what the supreme court in the united states said in banning pitbulls pitbull attacks unlike other dogs occur more often are more severe and are more likely to result in fatalities
3413476 however interestingly the court did not cite any scientific sources for this legal conclusion meaning theres no reason why that happens other than a pitbull is a pitbull and we cant understand why it happens but it happens
3413477 many small children who frequent the dog run and its a concern for all of us and were very fearful of a tragedy
3413478 council will consider what steps we can take or we should take to limit or ban pitbulls from the dog run or impose restrictions on pitbulls such as wearing a muzzle or other types of possibilities
3413479 certainly its something that council is sensitive to so over the next month well try to make a decision as to what we would do with respect to pitbulls and other similarly dangerous breeds
3413480 the goal of this event is to show people that tennis is a fun sport
3413481 its not about winning and being competitive its about having a good time playing the sport you love
3413482 this event is a great opportunity for young people to try out professional gear that they might not be able to afford
3413483 the tourn e sports experts is an attempt to democratise tennis and make it accessible to everyone
3413484 the kids are having a great time im happy that all my students showed up for the event
3413485 my three eldest are enrolled in tennis classes and practice three days a week in somerled park i think its important for them to be outside and be active
3413486 its not what we were used to in c te st luc or what any other municipality was used to prior to merger and we really need some better fire prevention and inspection we knew this was going to happen when they merged the fire department
3413487 obviously we had very little impact during the merger years even though we werent merged with lachine and lasalle these cities had very effective fire inspection services as we did
3413488 it was when i learned that there were 20 million children in africa infected with aids that i shifted my energies to helping those children
3413489 these children wrote their own songs made a cd and asked me if they could come to canada
3413490 ma chi te lo fa fare di iniziare a 31 anni
3413491 its time for a change here in westmount ville marie
3413492 i need to be able to look her in the eye and say ive done something
3413493 in the last term there were 43 confidence votes and the liberals voted with the conservatives on all of them
3413494 its generally acknowledged that laundry on outside clothes lines is one of the primary characteristics of a slum
3413495 aside from matters of aesthetics and appearance the presence of laundry definitely has a major effect on property values in the neighbourhood
3413496 we couldnt come to a decision to change the bylaw
3413497 while i personally would agree with you that it is environmentally friendly to hang clothes on a clothes line to the best of my knowledge no ticket has been given out in many many years for anyone hanging clothes on a clothes line
3413498 public security told me no tickets were given out in a long time
3413499 if you can tell me its legal i will use it and i wont use my dryer as much
3413500 after working in the restaurant industry and filling every position from hostess to management to cook at 23 i decided to open a catering business
3413501 the business flourished and i even had the great honour of catering the studys 75th anniversary in 1991 but in the past few years i decided to downscale and go back to the basics
3413502 based on the orders that have been placed by thursday i shop accordingly

3413507 emotional reactions gut feelings thoughts and impressions that dont seem entirely rational
3413508 its thinking that moves a little faster and operates a little more mysteriously than the kind of deliberate conscious decision making that we usually associate with thinking
3413509 hey were going to run to a meeting be back in a couple of hours
3413510 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3413511 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3413512 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
3413513 natos decision to withhold a membership action plan for georgia might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia and i urge the nato allies to revisit the decision

3413734 whats more with a system that ties health insurance to increasingly precarious job security almost any american working or middle class person may have to decide whether to pay the mortgage or pay the health insurance premiums if someone is too ill to work he can lose his job and mecdical coverage in one fell swoop
3413735 initially they told me you dont stand a chance to win but we need to put someone on the ballot
3413736 as a totally new person working within a party that has not had a great deal of success in recent years i really felt i needed a coach
3413737 after his death 13 days before the election the campaign staff decided that paul would have wanted to keep organizing and keep fighting for the little guy
3413738 dont have that regular weekly or monthly reminder that we need to be out engaging the community building our base
3413739 now that the house and senate have agreed on a compromise bill we are so close
3413740 this is literally a life or death issue for millions of americans suffering from mental illness and addiction
3413741 and im grateful we are so close to enacting legislation for which weve fought so long and hard
3413742 an unauthorized tour of the populist revolt scaring wall street and washington
3413743 i think were in for a cracker this time round
3413744 i dont like to see him on the ground but hes an athlete
3413745 i think the newest guy here defensive end jason taylor ran into him we hold our breath a little bit he doesnt want to hit him but when he beats our offensive players so bad its hard for him to stop because hes generating a lot of speed
3413746 marcus washington came in today and tagged the quarterback like in two hand touch and i dont even want him touched and he knows that i think in the heat of battle these guys get so fired up and the intensity level is high the strain is high they just find it hard to pull off it got a little dangerous today
3413747 ipod users immediately had access to thousands of songs they already owned the minute they synced their machines to their computers and they could get anything else they wanted for free if they chose to steal kindle users however are pretty much forced to pay 9 99 each time they want a new title
3413748 after reading this ad you will be 15 seconds closer to your next amstel
3413749 its cool to stay at my place in case any of us is too drunk
3413750 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3413751 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people were just like any other people out there we want to be ourselves and not be discriminated against
3413752 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3413753 no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3413754 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3413755 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people were just like any other people out there we want to be ourselves and not be discriminated against
3413756 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3413757 no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3413758 if you want to pick on people as the old playground saying goes pick on people your own size
3413759 this population struggles too much with the basics to have to struggle against hollywood were sending a message that this hate speech is no longer acceptable
3413760 im the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude
3413761 all i know is that we wanted to try one field using the organic treatment product
3413762 that particular product we felt was not effective and decided to stop using it
3413763 i think that the school district generally had an unrealistic view of the treatment
3413764 within the first application of any lawn it needs to be watered and i dont think they did that
3413765 im not going to dispute potters comments on watering the field
3413766 if i were him i would protect my product by making that claim i cant prove or disprove the claim on watering and not watering and neither can he
3413767 if you cut the grass too short the roots arent down as deep and therefore you get dirt spots
3413768 hes not trying to kill weeds hes trying to nourish the root systems weeds are always going to be a problem
3413769 compared to the rest of the campus its definitely better
3413770 the question you want to ask yourself is what are they doing for that amount of money
3413771 we did get the okay from the school board to spot treat areas using a chemical treatment in order to get ready for the school year
3413772 but we really want to stay with the policy of only using organic treatments
3413773 im much more aware of the stresses in my life and minimize it where possible and connect with people whenever i do have it so i have social support systems there when i need them
3413774 theres a lot more going on in the relationships ive had with my colleagues in the last year than just the politics
3413775 its made my service here my work here so much more enjoyable on a day to day basis a richer experience
3413776 i just take it you know life as they say to take it one day at a time
3413777 gain access to the kind of treatment i had thats why im so passionate about it
3413778 ultimately this is a civil rights battle because none of the people who suffer from a mental illness asked to suffer from a mental illness
3413779 thats going to be my volunteer job over the next six to eight weeks to try to make this thing happen
3413780 and to try to have a bill that my dad would be proud of
3413781 what else in the last 50 years has gone up only a dime
3413782 it has taken me 5 years going on 6 to convince the media that the tollway is not the bad guy
3413783 this is not just another public policy issue this is a life or death issue for millions of americans
3413784 i think the house bill would be a huge legacy for my dad
3413785 i know he would be opposed to the senate bill
3413786 obviously my father and i are trying to get the strongest bills through our respective chambers
3413787 the house bill is stronger in that it lets the medical community define mental illnesses rather than the insurance community
3413788 our bill has brought the senate bill together in a lot of ways
3413789 i dont think the senate bill would go as far it does had it not been for our bill
3413790 states have been very aggressive in going the extra mile we dont want to see that usurped by our work we want to see states be able to go further if they choose to
3413791 unequivocally protects the mandated mental health conditions covered by each state parity law including state medical management mandates and contractual arrangements
3413792 the senate parity bill gives 82 million people the assurance that their mental health benefit will be treated the same as their medical surgical benefit
3413793 it is a historic step forward in addressing the long standing discrimination against mental health
3413794 i wouldnt have wanted my dads name on that senate bill
3413795 it is a very strong bill that would end insurance discrimination against people with mental health illness and their families
3413796 we do support our troops but theyre just caught in a bad situation
3413797 i know those arent any profound words but its the truth
3413798 the lesson of vietnam should be that half of the american troops killed in vietnam were killed after the generals knew the war was lost
3413799 he was not that way at all he was very subdued he was very matter of fact he knew what the deal was
3413800 we werent prepared when bush stood on that aircraft carrier and said mission accomplished if that had been true my son would have been alive today
3413801 and i hate to see young men lose their lives in a country that doesnt want us there
3413802 healthcare qwest bargaining stewards army the 2008 presidential campaign and legislation are all part of a cycle of advocacy
3413803 i dont represent the big oil companies i dont represent the big pharmaceutical companies i dont represent the enrons of this world but you know what they already have great representation in washington its the rest of the people that need it i represent the people of minnesota
3413804 politics is not about left right and center it is about speaking to the concerns and circumstances of peoples lives
3413805 people yearn for a politics that speaks to and includes them
3413806 i dont always agree with you but i like it that i know where you stand
3413807 with a commitment of advocating for those who were afraid to use their voice or who were unable to
3413808 having lived in the community for the past fifteen years ive been really disappointed that i havent seen our representatives taking on that role as advocates for the people i feel the voice that really needs to be reflected is the voice of the people and so it was a natural lead for me to move into this new venue and new opportunity
3413809 it just made complete sense we would do this as a team
3413810 when i considered running it was never a question of who i would ask i could count on them we have the same vision and passion
3413811 the skills that we were introduced to in three days i cant tell you how many times ive pulled pieces from that training and been able to use
3413812 you have to get out of your comfort zone enough to knock on a door at a training or face a press conference crisis
3413813 party affiliation counts for less than i once guessed there are decent folks on both sides of the aisle take jim ramstad the guy is well really hes a total mensch
3413814 jim and i have fought like forever to win equal treatment for mental illness and addiction and im telling you hes just not giving up hes a recovering alcoholic he knows this stuff no big bucks insurance lobby will ever get him to back down i mean were definitely passing these bills next year no question but if it takes another 10 years that guy wont quit and neither will i
3413815 the future will not belong to those who sit on the sidelines the future will not belong to the cynics the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams
3413816 o pa s segue com forte taxa de crescimento mostrando resist ncia crise internacional e elevada taxa de juros que tendem a atrair as opera es de arbitragem
3413817 connecticut has probably one of the more advanced parity laws but it only applies to about a third of insurance holders
3413818 for those covered by group insurance there wouldnt be any benefits necessarily one way or the other
3413819 some people might have group coverage and still be in a self insured plan
3413820 the company itself kind of funds its own insurance costs
3413821 you may still have your coverage through aetna but rather than the insurer taking on the risk the company takes on the risk theyll have aetna serve as the third party administrator
3413822 our interest in this is that we want to be sure that anything that passes at the federal level doesnt pre empt doesnt negate some of our laws
3413823 we do have a fairly comprehensive mental health parity law
3413824 we are very hopeful that connecticuts mental health reform statutes are not undone or superseded by any federal statutes
3413825 if someone has a broken leg you know when its broken and you know when its fixed
3413826 its very difficult clinically to differentiate between people with depression and people who are sad it is in essence a self diagnosed illness
3413827 its not free if you make it appear to be free
3413828 not to make mental health special but to make it the same
3413829 there shouldnt be a disincentive for seeing the psychiatrist rather than seeing a doctor
3413830 inside the obama campaign an eclectic team of field organizers is attempting something that has long been considered impossible building a precinct level field organization large enough to affect the outcome of super tuesday now february 5 or super duper tuesday if successful aided by email lists web tools and old school organizing techniques long missing in electoral politics these organizers could rewrite the rules of presidential politics dramatically raise the profile of field organizing in the campaign world and help rebuild democratic party structure in states such as california that have been long forgotten to electoral field organizing
3413831 what gave obama an edge his strategists say was a heavy investment in grass roots organizing all campaigns try to build grass roots organizations especially those of charismatic challengers like obama but those efforts which often rely on neophyte volunteers whose enthusiasm exceeds their political skills often fade in the stretch obama sought to avoid that problem by organizing intensive regional training camps designed to help his volunteers function with near professional proficiency the precinct level operations were to employ theories of community organizing obama practiced in chicago before getting into electoral politics the purpose figueroa wrote is to provide supporters with the tools to create self sufficient interdependent teams that take responsibility for all aspects of a campaign within their congressional district trainers encourage volunteers to set up quasi independent local offices that tailor a personalized door to door pitch based on local circumstances or the latest campaign development
3413832 the teachers view the decision to strike as a last resort
3413833 my hope is that these settlements will help the survivors and their families begin to heal and move forward
3413834 i apologize again today to the survivors and their families and to the whole catholic community we must continue to do everything in our power to ensure the safety of the children in our care
3413835 the mediation process with the archdiocese of chicago was particularly effective because of the courage of the survivors and the personal involvement of cardinal george
3413836 cardinal george was actively involved in this process he has demonstrated his commitment to healing these survivors the release of his deposition today is a significant step toward openness and transparency and helps the survivors and the church community in healing and recovery
3413837 this mediation process sets a standard for best practices and can serve as a model for future mediations
3413838 i would like to acknowledge the efforts of all the people who worked so hard and overcame many obstacles to achieve this result for the survivors
3413839 i think there is a huge support for eliminating the eighth grade ceremony
3413840 i think about the influence of the internet and cable television and globalization
3413841 i am a multiplicity of identities maybe unresolved and maybe one possible contemporary proposition is that it doesnt have to be a resolved linearity i think thats part of the liberation of being a musicmaker today we can engage with all of these things
3413842 usually you think of technology and recordings as something that enhances the means of art in reproduction but ive been interested in ways that that can be kind of subverted
3413843 if you privilege the live experience then you privilege the fact that its ephemeral
3413844 the audience knows theres a certain part of it that is not reproducible through mechanical means that having gone to see it they know that theyve shared in this communal thing that happened and then at that moment realize that if they were to experience a cd or dvd representation of what had happened they know that they would have definitely lost something
3413845 its one of the things i have to think a lot about who am i writing for what would make them feel comfortable and in what ways can i engage with what theyre good at doing so that together we can create something thats meaningful for all
3413846 i get a look at the guy and ask so are you going to wear this on your wedding day or is it everyday youre going to wear this
3413847 the oil pipeline was never a target that needed to be bombed
3413848 were not aware of any attack at all we have no report at all of an attack
3413849 russians bombed the btc pipeline south of the city of rustavi
3413850 we dont know yet whether it was damaged its the second attempt to bomb this pipeline since august 10
3413851 if nothing is done there wont be any brown bears left in austria in a few years time its an endangered species
3413852 weve considered everything disease migration but some of our bears may also have been killed illegally
3413853 the absolute weight doesnt matter it depends on how long you try to hold it if i hold it for a minute thats not a problem if i hold it for an hour ill have an ache in my right arm if i hold it for a day youll have to call an ambulance in each case its the same weight but the longer i hold it the heavier it becomes
3413854 and thats the way it is with a bad marriage
3413855 those who dont think miles davis was a sellout for going electric and who dont think cecil taylors whole style is merely derivative of the european avant garde
3413856 to me the conception of the bad plus is actually derived from the way coltrane and his band played my favorite things
3413857 i think theres a lot of what wynton is doing thats great this guy can play his ass off
3413858 thats ridiculous music isnt a war its not a competition
3413859 what if a politician were to see his job as that of an organizer as part teacher and part advocate one who does not sell voters short but who educates them about the real choices before them
3413860 since embarking on a political career obama hasnt forgotten the philosophical and practical lessons that he learned on the streets of chicago and that are now central to his campaign for the white house
3413861 its teaching people how to organize and mobilize people so they can build respectful coalitions
3413862 this is what i think a once in a lifetime opportunity we are thrilled to offer it
3413863 the main thing for me is i want to try to bring more grassroots groups together
3413864 its more about a community and really getting people together and it doesnt have to be so radical
3413865 sometimes id get down about how difficult its been to get this passed
3413866 paul would always say jim remember it took 40 years for civil rights bills to get passed
3413867 but hed also be really proud davids got a great heart and hes doing everything he can to get this done
3413868 it feels good to work on this it brings back a lot of good memories
3413869 after the crash it was just a little too hard to try to live up to his name in minnesota
3413870 the hypocrisy of the international community knows no bounds for if the west forced the issue of kosovar independence then the independence of south ossetia should also be on the cards
3413871 israel is following with great concern the developments in south ossetia and abkhazia and hopes the violence will end
3413872 israel recognizes the territorial integrity of georgia and calls for a peaceful solution
3413873 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
3413874 a small group of georgian soldiers were able to wipe out an entire russian military division thanks to the israeli training
3413875 georgian minister tells israel radio thanks to israeli training were fending off russian military
3413876 the fact that georgias defense minister davit kezerashvili is a former israeli who is fluent in hebrew contributed to this cooperation
3413877 internalized israeli military technique and if the special reconnaissance forces have chalked up any successes
3413878 idf vets who trained georgia troops say war with russia is no surprise
3413879 every bomb that falls on our heads is an attack on democracy on the european union and on america
3413880 give volunteers power and treat them like people not cattle
3413881 i tried to get as much face time with voters as i possibly could
3413882 theres all this talk about whether we should move right or move left
3413883 i say before we do that we need to move down down into the communities and into the grassroots
3413884 after knocking on their doors and actually talking to them i felt a stronger connection to them
3413885 i could just say to them i dont care who you vote for just vote
3413886 in the next election well keep seeing the fruit of this cross pollination
3413887 they gave me goldwaters the conscience of a conservative to read on the plane
3413888 paul replied that he too had read senator goldwaters book at a young age and explained
3413889 i also told them that i admired barry goldwater for his political integrity
3413890 people yearn for a politics of the center not the center so widely discussed by politicians and pundits in washington but rather a politics that speaks to the center of peoples lives affordable child care good education for children health security living wage jobs that will support families respect for the environment and human rights and clean elections and clean campaigns
3413891 the house always seemed dark to me even when the lights were on it was such a sad home
3413892 if i had a heart ailment they wouldnt think twice about sending me to a cardiologist
3413893 this isnt something ive chosen anymore than people who suffer from diabetes or heart disease chose their conditions
3413894 our country must make a commitment americans with mental illness deserve our understanding and they deserve excellent care they deserve a health care system that treats their illness with the same urgency as physical illness
3413895 what if a politician were to see his job as that of an organizer as part teacher and part advocate one who does not sell voters short but who educates them about the real choices before them
3413896 since embarking on a political career obama hasnt forgotten the philosophical and practical lessons that he learned on the streets of chicago and that are now central to his campaign for the white house
3413897 for five years i have heard promise after promise that congress will pass mental health parity legislation in my fathers honor
3413898 the american people should not have to wait any longer to receive the same access to treatment that members of congress have
3413899 constrain employers flexibility in plan offerings and ultimately cause employers to cut or curtail voluntary benefit offerings
3413900 with passage of this bill in the house we are one step closer to ending the discrimination against those who suffer from debilitating mental health disorders
3413901 we feel good about having senator wellstones name on it
3413902 we have submitted a bid and we are waiting for arsenal to respond
3413903 there is a financial responsibility on behalf of the state of minnesota to ensure that taxpayer dollars are not being abused
3413904 the welfare system is growing exponentially and receiving a greater share of the states budget we want to take care of families in need but also ensure that no one is abusing the system for their own financial gain at the expense of minnesota families struggling to pay their own bills
3413905 worrying about everyone and everything you both have to be on the top of your game i wasnt on top of my game but tom was nowhere near the top of his
3413906 somewhere along the line the reality of the situation was going to hit home its a typical partnership they finished eighth and had high hopes of doing well and the emotion came out the fact tom has a partner who is 26 there are going to be differences
3413907 to us it was good because we can say right what did you learn from this with the world championships next year they are going to be so much better
3413908 tom and blake are looking forward to regrouping and looking forward to the future
3413909 sometimes things are said in the heat of the moment which shouldnt be said out in public im sure blake in hindsight would have decided to act differently
3413910 the gold medal is the best birthday present i have ever had
3413911 i hope the luck can be with me all the time
3413912 engaged in the business of discovering and developing artists in the music industry
3413913 espn viewers were shocked to discover this morning that there was an
3413914 steve laments his impending post espn life which basically means appearing on
3413915 i can do everything through him who gives me strength
3413916 when we lost the two of them and their daughter the two surviving sons got together with colleagues and close associates of the wellstones for many years and said what can we do to make this tragedy not so tragic by carrying on the work that paul and sheila did
3413917 they need to know how to do it they need to know how to organize on their issues how to have a message that communicates with the broader public how to get volunteers involved all the kind of skills which come with many years of organizing
3413918 this is a great opportunity to learn some leadership skills and strategies
3413919 and paul wellstone was a very inspirational and motivational person and so i think i can learn a lot from that this weekend
3413920 ive been working on campaigns for a long long time so thats what im doing
3413921 i am very concerned that a lot of citizens at least a lot of the citizens that im in contact with on a regular basis they dont really seem to follow politics that much they dont really seem to be very aware or active on civic duties
3413922 i want to inform myself so that i can hopefully motivate some of my fellow citizens and neighbors
3413923 im thinking about perhaps some studies in international relations or public policy so i thought this would be a good way to get information ive also thought about working with some candidates too so this is a great way to learn about all that at once
3413924 in the last election the number was in the 30s i would say
3413925 right now we have 17 in the legislature who are union members and it was probably 12 or 13 before the last election
3413926 id be surprised if we dont get into the 20s this time even 25 or better i think thats going to encourage other people to run as well
3413927 there are a lot of people who say they understand working peoples issues and some do
3413928 but the fact is unless youve been a union member or been on the picket line or been without a paycheck because of a strike unless youve gone through that you really dont understand
3413929 they are very good but they dont necessarily understand what it means to deal with intimidation at work and that sort of thing
3413930 similar to what some people talk about having a calling for religion i felt i had a calling to get involved in politics people are ready for a change thats what i put on my literature
3413931 the main reason was that i saw so many things that were going the wrong direction that i needed to get involved everything from the high cost of health care in minnesota to the way there have been huge cuts in funding for education resulting in higher class size
3413932 i live outside the twin cities our roads and bridges are getting in worse shape and the money is not coming back to greater minnesota for fixing them
3413933 they say okay youve got my vote there have been very few instances where its been a negative reaction
3413934 my feeling is there are too many business interests injecting their philosophy on how quality of life in minnesota should be
3413935 a big move to unseat the incumbents throw the incumbent out
3413936 i think they have a grassroots organizing capability that the republicans dont necessarily have access to
3413937 i think a lot of the union members are much more educated in politics now than they were in the past theyre really realizing how it affects their daily lives things they worked for for years can be erased with the stroke of a pen at the legislative level
3413938 i decided to run because i became frustrated like many of my union brothers and sisters by the lack of investment in minnesota
3413939 its become very clear that what i feel about the failings in health care environmentalists are feeling about the environment a failure to address the future were just treading water and that hasnt been minnesotas tradition
3413940 the beginning of a shift in the way labor sees its power
3413941 for years and years they saw their power as being a lever on those in power which is something you can do when you have 30 percent union density and when 50 percent of households are union households
3413942 i think with declining union density theres also a realization that if we are to build union power in this country we have to become decision makers
3413943 the infrastructure is just getting into place now the problem is that theres no institutional support outside of the work were putting together to train union folks to run for office and speak to a broader office
3413944 i think its one of the missing pieces in terms of looking at labor as an overall political program
3413945 i think we need to start in the off year and do that
3413946 i think thats the biggest hurdle that theyre seen as a narrow special interest
3413947 thats one of the key reasons for doing the wellstone action training to teach people to talk about a broader worker agenda so that its not just a union agenda with 8 5 percent of the population represented by the unions the rest of the population has to see themselves in that or they wont buy it
3413948 the folks i deal with every day in labor are a whole lot more connected with their community and are more with it than other people
3413949 they bring an understanding of what it means to make ends meet today
3413950 i think what union members bring that regular workers dont is that the power of collective action can actually improve your life theres such a missing piece in politics right now that believes that as collective action we can make things better and thats what unions do
3413951 i knew i wanted to get involved but i didnt know how
3413952 so i decided to go to camp wellstone and see what i could get out of the experience
3413953 i started asking myself how can i do this and be in a leadership role
3413954 the people doing the training knew what they are talking about and the participants had a lot to add it was empowering to see how i could transition my organizing skills into being a senior staff member
3413955 acms helped with the work im doing now organizing and having a strategic plan
3413956 putting together an actual plan is something i had never done before acms i had always been the one implementing a plan that others wrote
3413957 it allows me to make a difference and do what i love
3413958 i had only done lobbying once in my life and was painfully shy about it however due to my experience at camp wellstone and the lobbying simulation i was able to feel confident enough to phone state legislators regarding a bill i was concerned about and give my message
3413959 i am putting to use the skills i got out of camp wellstone by meeting with public officials knowing how to perform gotv operations and staying on message for the upcoming battle
3413960 i think camp wellstone for me was another step in the process of me getting more active politically again
3413961 thanks to wellstone action for all your help and support especially moral support it feels like this will be our year
3413962 the camp was the best money my campaign has spent

3414227 this was kind of like using the hand grenade on the horsefly if you throw the book at this guy then what do you do about there are plenty of guys down there that are really bad guys that need to have the book thrown at them but if you do a 30 year minimum sentence which was the prosecutions request and they would have preferred life where do you step up from that
3414228 in none of the evidence presented did you ever see him brandishing a weapon at all even when he was captured and the evidence all showed that there was an ak 47 right there in the front seat the guys behind him and in front of him deployed weapons he bailed out of the car and ran
3414229 when he knows that hes in u s hands when he is relatively secure that no one is going to bring harm to him or his family you can understand that the level of cooperation changed and thats very understandable again from our point of view as armed forces members
3414230 it was a framework which we were told to operate in its different from a regular ucmj uniform code of military justice court martial type proceeding we understood that from the get go we understood the judges instructions

3414238 we see little to stop google from reaching 70 percent market share eventually the question really comes down to how long could it take
3414239 we believe that search is a natural monopoly business and expect that over time google will continue to gain share until they have effectively reached 100 percent
3414240 over the last two years google has gained 50 basis points of share month in the u s and 60bp globally we expect these share gains to accelerate as declining scale makes it more difficult for competitors to justify the technology investments needed to maintain search result quality
3414241 the real estate market crashed gas prices are horrible for a destination driven market the economy in the world today is down and its an election year

3414243 so you get to a point where you cant do it anymore because youre putting good money after bad

3414249 the clouds you so much fear will break with blessings upon your head to quote william cowper whom ferguson does often
3414250 they may know that god is sovereign but they have no idea how he will demonstrate his sovereignty that is the position we ordinarily occupy in our own lives we do not have direct access to the mind of god to know the details of his plans and purposes
3414251 for this purpose he has given us the written word to be a lamp to our feet and encouraged us to pray for the teaching of his holy spirit that we may rightly understand and apply it in general he guides and directs his people by affording them in answer to prayer the light of his holy spirit which enables them to understand and love the scriptures
3414252 that is why we can be quietly confident not because we know exactly what god is doing in this unpredictable world but because we know that what is unpredictable to us is already predicted by him he has written his purposes for us in his own book and numbered out days before one of them was given birth or saw the light of day
3414253 if god does not do things speedily enough for us in our way then we will take matters into our own hands we devise our own ways of bringing to pass what god has promised to give to us we refuse to wait for him to bring his own purposes to fruition

3414256 our results could contribute to the development of targeted therapies and thus improve the treatment of cerebellar tumours in children
3414257 but for that to be possible we first need to understand the principles of how the tumours develop
3414258 if we know how a tumour arises at the molecular level we can also develop specific therapies that actually treat the cause of that particular condition
3414259 normally the signalling pathway ensures a balance of growth and maturation of cells
3414260 but if disrupted it can lead to uncontrolled growth of cells and thus the onset of cancer
3414261 all of our studies have shown that medulloblastomas can only develop from granule cells and their progenitors
3414262 other cells on the other hand such as the large purkinje cells of the cerebellum do not become tumourigenic they dont seem bothered by these mutations at all
3414263 but we also found olig2 in progenitors of the granule cells of the cerebellum and in tumour cells
3414264 that means this protein also influences the formation and multiplication of cancer cells which makes it clear once again just how closely normal and malignant development processes resemble one another we hope our results will contribute to a targeted therapy for medulloblastomas that will require further research however which we already have in the planning

3414269 this brings me to the definition of scientific research scientific research is not something produced by universities institutions and other building confined thought nor is scientific research a practice defined by the changing fads and feelings of academics scientific research is not what is reported in the media as weve found the cure nor is it the product of partisan funding which dictates the outcome before the project is begun scientific research is a process of establishing verifiable patterns of activity without bias on the part of the researcher or observer bias exists in all research but the trick is to identify the presence of bias within the researcher s and the research environment and actively and consciously bracket this out or build in safety controls to prevent contamination this is not taught in academic research class anymore i have seen more valid research performed statistically and qualitatively by non affiliate academics and by run of the mill ba degree owners than by institutionalized scientists who seem always to miss the point yet the work that gets acceptance is the work produced by institutionalized minds and the research that could make a real difference is consigned to the trash heap of history it remains one of the greatest sadnesses for me that friends who are brilliant academics and contributing minds have been sidelined because their research no longer fits the fad it is no wonder we are still dogged by aids and by other social issues that could be solved but for the lack of the right people in the right places
3414270 most of us fled from kumisar afdub rebo omar don and dhur dher locations in kalafe district of the somali region of ethiopia
3414271 we were farming communities some of us fled during the war while others arrived following the drought that hit the region

3414279 with a single command linmin detects all networking attributes then downloads installs and configures a database network services and other required software components and presents to the administrator a fully configured provisioning and imaging server in about 5 minutes
3414280 even non it software can trigger the deployment of new systems or the repurposing of existing ones for example human resources information systems can now instruct linmin bare metal provisioning to prepare office or technical desktops and laptops for new employees
3414281 ipnetzone has come to rely on linmin for both the provisioning and imaging of servers in our various co location sites
3414282 linmins new api will enable us to offer even better responsiveness to customer requests for additional and or differently configured linux and windows servers
3414283 now with the new linmin api customers can optimize it resources physical virtual and human around business processes not the other way around
3414284 linmins ability to install applications and management agents during the provisioning process is even more valuable with the api bringing a closed loop process to customers existing environments automatically select an appropriate and available physical or virtual system invoke the linmin api and after the system is provisioned these agents identify themselves to their respective management monitoring policy enforcement availability compliance and other applications that then take control of the system

3414294 by combining the vulnerabilities with the series 40 issues one could develop malware which could be simply deployed and that malware wont be visible to the user

3414296 there are six long months of work in this research
3414297 some will be against this and some will be for it
3414298 they have a choice whether they want to sign up for our security research or whether they want to devote research engineers of their own to investigate the vulnerabilities
3414299 this is the first time that such a widespread and critical attack has been demonstrated against nokias series 40 devices
3414300 we have proved that these devices can be hacked and infected with malware in a very similar way pc computers are

3414304 by partnering with surgient we can now offer clients access to environment configurations through a centrally managed shared service eliminating manual provisioning work and delivering much higher utilization of expensive pre production infrastructure the results expected are shorter response times reduced costs and ultimately better business support
3414305 the surgient platform provides organizations insight into enterprise wide inefficiencies granting their it departments extra time to uncover defects and improve software quality prior to going live
3414306 our growth both externally as well as internally was massive the sheer number of new servers and their associated applications proved especially challenging as we attempted to reconcile our business expansion within the physical limits of our current infrastructure we knew virtualization was a means through which we could effectively and intelligently approach our integration challenges

3414349 this year they can count on the best attack in europe everyone talks of the problems that ranieri will have to manage trezeguet del piero iaquinta amauri but i think that the coach will be very pleased to have so much offensive quality at his disposal
3414350 in particular del piero has had an extraordinary rebirth and im beginning to think that the demotion to serie b has been beneficial
3414351 such an extraordinary player can lead juve to a new triumph
3414352 i have focused on my squad who i have complete faith in had he come great he didnt but nothing to worry about were still on track to have a successful year

3414354 am i relying on julio baptista we hope to have everyone play but metzelder ramos and de la red will see their first action and we have to see what state they are in
3414355 we have to keep a close eye on others because they have played every game julio will get playing time in the second half because he is a member of this squad
3414356 this weekend marks the start of the season for both sides its a very important test and its crucial that we feel good out there heading into the super cup
3414357 eintracht are a strong rival and your typical german team its a good chance to see what our limitations are and to prepare in order to be in top form at the start of the season
3414358 will i use the super cup line up similar but not exactly the same we already know that pepe cannot play the super cup but he will start tonight
3414359 we hope tonights opponent wants to win but not by any means necessary hopefully nothing will happen and that we all return safe and sound the super cup is an official title and we want to win it it is extremely important
3414360 weve got some good young players and we will give them a go but we need to get that understanding of what we are doing

3414370 cari amici grazie per tutto questi giorni finiscono ma porto con me un tesoro di ricordi

3414374 bella e buona ma per il fatto di essere cos ardua e pesante difficilmente pu essere utile la legge di maometto invece ha preso la via di mezzo e dando disposizioni che si possono soddisfare ben pi miti e adatte alluomo supera del tutto le altre leggi proprio per il fatto di essere moderata
3414375 sicuramente argomentava tempo fa il cardinale joseph ratzinger questo un esempio estremo ma mostra pur sempre che non si devono vedere automaticamente in tutte le religioni vie di dio verso luomo e delluomo verso dio
3414376 laddove non sussiste prima la fede esse non sono sufficienti per convincere della verit del mistero
3414377 riconoscere il loro carattere di avvento che le rimanda a cristo
3414378 questa la grande pretesa con cui la fede cristiana entrata nel mondo ci implica lobbligo morale di mandare tutti i popoli a scuola da ges poich egli la verit in persona e perci la via per essere uomini
3414379 quel divino che pu essere percepito dallanalisi razionale della realt
3414380 poich cristo a un tempo il mistero rivelatore e il mistero rivelato il mediatore e la pienezza della rivelazione ne segue che egli occupa nella fede cristiana una posizione assolutamente unica che distingue il cristianesimo da tutte le religioni compreso lebraismo il cristianesimo lunica religione la cui rivelazione si incarna in una persona che si presenta come la verit viva e assoluta altre religioni hanno fondatori ma nessuno di questi buddha confucio zoroastro maometto si proposto come oggetto della fede dei suoi discepoli credere in cristo significa credere in dio cristo non un semplice fondatore di religione egli contemporaneamente immanente alla storia e suo trascendente assoluto non uno fra mille ma lunico il totalmente altro

3414552 when you get criticism as long as its fair and honest players will always accept it and kevin can do that its quite insightful how he sees the game and if he gives feedback it will be fair and honest
3414553 if that was the situation and they thought they should cop it then theyd be happy to take it they would take it on the chin and respond to it
3414554 i think players like to be supported because its a tough environment out there
3414555 there will be a case to be supportive but also there will be times when he will have words with players because that will be the right thing to do at the time
3414556 what they will know with kevin is that hell be in there scrapping with them he will put his own neck on the line and hell get stuck in and go with it and i think theyll respect him for that

3414799 rhode island is already feeling the pressures of the national economic downward spiral with increased unemployment and decreasing general revenues the single largest expenditure of the states budget is health and human services and the simplest way to balance the budget would be to eliminate programs and reduce eligibility that may save a few dollars in the short run but it does not address the problems that only systemic change can solve
3414800 fiscal pressures service demand and institutional bias have colluded to push rhode island further down the path toward comprehensive medicaid reform the global medicaid waiver allows the state to implement reforms to protect the long term viability of the program i am encouraged by recent conversations with cms in expediting the approval of the waiver which is critical to achieving maximum budget cost savings
3414801 we are optimistic that we will get a favorable response from cms that will allow us to delve into the detailed planning of how best to deliver the services that medicaid supports

3414823 the audience is the most important part of your team blog
3414824 i think after we rocked the high bar we were like this is happening its happening after that moment we felt like we couldnt do anything wrong
3414825 if i was there by myself i wouldve been crapping my pants
3414826 but these guys theyre all yelling come on i could hear them stay confident swing big we dont have anything to lose
3414827 i had so much energy i felt like i couldve done another routine after that
3414828 weve said this is a family of nine and those guys were pulling for each other out there
3414829 its just been a tumultuous roller coaster ride and i couldnt be prouder of these guys this whole entire collective and collaborative effort really showed today
3414830 probably the most clutch performance ive ever seen in my whole life
3414831 but the real winners the real competitors in a sport like this are the guys that can overcome those nerves and thats what we did today
3414832 we have enough game ideas to do geometry wars for probably about 10 games it depends on what will work
3414833 we have begun expanding our markets internationally and not confining ourselves to the domestic market
3414834 i think it is about time to have our reference price
3414835 if the plan goes through what we should also take into account is whether or not a cpo spot market in rupiah denomination is complementary to malaysias futures contract
3414836 our aim is to create a benchmark for the spot price not for the futures contract
3414837 it wont be too difficult for the exchange to make it happen what is more difficult is how to encourage the players to participate thats beyond our control it may require the sense of nationalism
3414838 as a result a lot of property developers are reviewing not only their sales prices but their ability to launch the project however for properties in the higher end i think the demand is still very strong and margins are quite healthy
3414839 we believe that based on the product offerings that we have and the demand we are seeing today our numbers for the year will still be very strong
3414840 we do not comment on our pregame or halftime show plans until we announce the talent i would have said the same thing to the new york post if someone from there would have called before it ran the item
3414841 i didnt know i was down i thought i was ahead
3414842 there was so much going on in the crowd everybody was yelling and screaming
3414843 i was looking at my teammates and it sounded like they were saying move and it also sounded like they were saying fight i just thought i was up because i was scoring
3414844 when you get to july 1 terms and dollars you dont want to go there but sometimes you go there
3414845 when you make a trade or draft a player you want guys to have a passion to bring in that player

3414860 iggy has now basically reduced himself to three things quoting in full although usually not linking the occasional newspaper article on something poker related quoting in full articles related to the us presidential race usually with a very obvious slant of pro obama con hillary and posting poker stories by johnny hughes unfortunately the lions share of his posts are in the second category and if youre wondering what exactly it is iggy writes himself in all of this youre touching a good point i think my post here today contains more words than hes written himself in the past year

3414866 i hope well never come to the question of what we do if russia refuses to observe international law
3414867 the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3414868 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3414869 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3414870 public place copies or those given away by a third party partner
3414871 definitely im happy for him i know this is his life and being neda chair this is his forte we all know he is an economist i know he has a vision for neda
3414872 by and large all government agencies need to be transparent and thats part of my philosophy anyway
3414873 oil prices we will have a discussion on friday the neda team is already working on getting information and determining what would be these benchmark rates but i think easily we can expect a rollback in oil prices soon
3414874 when the dollar appreciates oil prices go down as well as other commodities like gold they have been going down and i think it is important to note that people can expect a reduction in oil prices soon a rollback soon
3414875 i am not against it specific tax on oil particularly but if you do that who gets hit
3414876 so thats one concern that we would look into as well
3414877 at the moment as far as vat is concerned i think for the first six months of the year we have already attained roughly p53 billion thats within target the next six months we are expecting the same amount more or less so you might even have a better than expected collection as far as vat is concerned
3414878 i dont want to put too much emphasis on it
3414879 its special for me because i remember her playing hockey with all the boys
3414880 i remember her changing her name to carl to play in a tournament because girls werent allowed to play i saw her putting her ponytail under her helmet so nobody would know she was a girl i saw all that theres someone who plays hockey for the love of the game
3414881 and its not just cammi but all the girls who played in the first olympics and world championships they didnt play for any other reason except they loved the game what they did for the womens game and womens sports you cant take your hats off enough
3414882 they didnt listen to no you cant do this cammis answer always was why not when she was a little girl she said im going to play for the blackhawks what do you mean youre going to play for the blackhawks well why not
3414883 she heard you cant play in the tournament she said well why not im a good player so all along thats the way it was she taught me a lot about the fire inside the drive to motivate yourself
3414884 they told me we succeeded we are the world champions i told them we reached our target
3414885 other teams were good but we were better we performed perfect today everyone was excellent
3414886 it bothers me a lot especially if people from home kind of put down our team saying count the u
3414887 i wish more people in the u s believed in us like we believed in us now i hope more people realize the u s is a force to be reckoned with
3414888 since athens the chinese team has run into a lot of failures which tested the team

3414899 when you lose a race like that it motivates me even more to try to swim faster
3414900 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3414901 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3414902 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3414903 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3414904 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3414905 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history
3414906 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
3414907 i set up an opportunity to have a perfect swim tomorrow
3414908 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3414909 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3414910 its his physical ability its his ability to race its his ability to keep focused to get excited when he needs to and to come down when he needs to come down
3414911 last year in melbourne at the world championships one swim started it and then swims just started happening one after another after another we had a great morning this morning and hopefully we can set up some more good swims tonight and keep the ball rolling
3414912 i just wanted to win my heat and set everything up for tomorrow
3414913 just get through that and prepare myself for tomorrow thats the most important thing an afternoon off and its time to just sort of get as rested as i can recover and i probably have to re shave get all of that stuff down
3414914 when it comes to the challenges of ownership i think that decentralization of ec aid is an important factor decentralization to the delegations so that the dialogue can take place on a level where the partnership is taking place and that goes for all the member states but certainly for the governments and the civil society and that is something for what we have to work stronger for the decentralization of the delegations
3414915 i was satisfied with the vote i thought it was fair im glad to have this over and im ready to move forward

3415021 like ive done throughout my career whether its been with england or at county level ive proved people wrong and i will certainly prove the cricket management wrong next season and hopefully keep proving them wrong
3415022 its a decision our cricket committee have made to enable a little bit of movement to open up opportunities for some of our younger players in the wings
3415023 with a player such as dominic in the last year of a contract he was obviously looking for a little bit of clarity to whats going to happen to enable him to plan for the future
3415024 hes put his heart and soul into lancashire cricket and its with a heavy heart that he moves on
3415025 hes still very committed to lancashires championship campaign this season
3415026 and he would enjoy nothing better than to have success in that competition
3415027 dominic is a top performer and is one of my signings as well i brought him to lancashire

3415062 as a former australia test player a coach and someone who lives in pakistan he is in a unique position to give his perspective to those stakeholders
3415063 i dont want to comment on what is good and what is not good but i hope the icc addresses the players concerns adequately and not only convinces me but also players who have shown concerns over playing in pakistan
3415064 pakistan has been given the all clear to hold the champions trophy
3415065 i think personally from what i have seen and what i have heard and beginning to witness some of the actual security implementation measures i am quite impressed with the level of security in place
3415066 to convince them is a big challenge and its upon us to convey the message and to raise the confidence based on what we have seen and experienced that the security arrangements in place should be sufficient to have the event safe and secure
3415067 ive definitely got reservations 100 per cent about going to pakistan

3415091 we held two trial matches where akhtar proved his fitness and he is willing to return and since he is determined he is an asset for pakistan
3415092 his lawyer has argued that akhtar can pay the fine once the appeal against the reduced ban is heard in the court so we have decided to keep the legal matter and cricket separate
3415093 we rested akmal and he too showed improvement in the trial matches so we have included him

3415104 you never really know why somebody wants to be around you or if they do genuinely like you

3415118 the problem is the number of public companies has shrunk every year for the last eight years
3415119 that means fewer buyers every year it puts more power in the hands of select buyers
3415120 theyre vcs consuming the wealth of the generation of vcs that preceded them that created the companies that are buyers that are in place today and theyre not repopulating the system the ecosystem with more buyers
3415121 the three british soldiers were evacuated to a military hospital where one of them sadly died from his wounds our thoughts and condolences are with his family friends and comrades
3415122 it is with deep regret that we must announce that a soldier from 16 signal regiment has died and two more from the same regiment wounded in a suicide attack on a vehicle patrol in kabul afghanistan
3415123 we denounce this heartless act and i offer our condolences and sympathies to the families of those killed and injured this attackers target might have been isaf soldiers but he only succeeded in proving the insurgents utter disregard for the lives of the afghan people
3415124 acts such as this will not deter isaf in our commitment to help afghans create a better afghanistan

3415129 as soon as you think youre pregnant and you want to go private get in and see your gp and ask for a referral
3415130 we also do testing for down syndrome at 12 to 13 weeks
3415131 so its nice to be able to see the woman earlier
3415132 the mater and the wesley were doing between about 500 900 a year when i started
3415133 in brisbane and in sydney its the same but the problem is probably worse in provincial areas
3415134 if pregnant women cant get in it usually does mean that they have to go into the public system
3415135 but that 1 million wont all go into his pocket hes running something similar to a small business
3415136 that can be why obstetricians limit the number of mothers they take on
3415137 people might say we should train more obstetricians but theres a limit to how many the college can train
3415138 with workforce issues you have to look at are people really missing out on the care that they need
3415139 it really becomes incumbent to look at what they can do to attract people to the area
3415140 as soon as i was eight weeks i asked a couple of friends for recommendations for an obstetrician
3415141 i just felt like ok now i can have this baby
3415142 but ive heard other mums say they felt the same with their midwives
3415143 its just who you have built up that relationship with
3415144 being an older mum i wanted to have every test possible and the best possible care so thats why i went private
3415145 it is very important that all parties go back to the status quo as it existed on the 6th of august
3415146 all forces must be in the position they had on that date
3415147 reiterated in very strong terms the full respect for the territorial integrity of georgia
3415148 i dont honestly think that the bombardments we have seen the naval blockade we have seen and the massive use of force by the russians we have seen is in conformity with its peacekeeping mandate it has not much to do with peacekeeping
3415149 given the remarks the allies and i have made about the use of excessive and disproportionate force i cannot imagine that the allies and russia will quickly see eye to eye on this one
3415150 a number of allies suggested that there could not be business as usual with russia
3415151 clearly we will have a relation with russia we have to but we have to think through what that means when we have an ongoing military conflict in which russia is engaged with a partner country of nato
3415152 we think we need to look at how we are working with russia
3415153 i will have plenty of pasta and pizza and then try to get as much rest as i can
3415154 the aggressor must know that the attack against a sovereign country will bring international sanctions

3415175 we wanted it to be like a community fair like our own little block party but contained within the store
3415176 weve always had this idea of doing a 72 hour store and this seemed like the perfect time to celebrate
3415177 whether it be the olympics or a restaurant or anything we always just liked this idea of celebrating something and thats the kind of feel we want the store to have all the time
3415178 i would love to design something for gymnastics and the swimming would be fun because its so little but it can be so much
3415179 totally id love to do something really graphic in black or blue for gymnastics or ice skating
3415180 i understand its a performance and people are viewing it from afar and thats why they put all the bells and whistles on them but think they can be equally effective if they were like really graphic and well designed
3415181 its a fascination with egypt like francophile but were doing it in a subtle way so that its wearable
3415182 all the shapes and details are a little bit more special and theres more beading and hardware theres just a bit more of everything
3415183 i might try to go home and sleep when the store is opened during the normal day hours

3415186 im sure he has petry syndrome those people walk just like that
3415187 no i dont think so the old man surely has zovitzki syndrome he walks just like we learned in class
3415188 were medical students and couldnt ignore the way you walk but we couldnt agree on the syndrome you might have could you tell us what it is
3415189 ill tell you but first youll tell me what you think
3415190 i thought i needed to fart i thought but i was wrong
3415191 you know what i dont even believe half the things they say anymore theyve been writing bad stuff about me for a long time i remember one time this lady came up to me and said im not gonna see your movie but my friend said it was good
3415192 its distressing that there were citizens that thought they were doing a job and they were asked to resign

3415197 pay increases are only one way an organization attracts and retains talent regardless of the overall economy
3415198 organizations continually evaluate the attractiveness of their entire rewards package and develop new programs accordingly they are investing in other areas of total rewards such as employee development training and work life balance for example the number of organizations offering telework as a flexible work program is up significantly 40 percent compared to a year ago
3415199 it is good to rub and polish our brain against that of others
3415200 but it sounds like we wont be able to get tickets to that
3415201 im happy overall i crossed the finish line laughing and its been a great experience
3415202 i got four runs at the olympics my family got to watch brother sister mom and dad my grandmother aunt and uncle
3415203 the whitewater here is more difficult than any other course in the world i think
3415204 if you got off line just a little bit on this course its hard to get back on because there arent many breaks its pretty constant and pushy all the way down
3415205 and saw an opportunity to go into gate 4 and cut the line and take a bit of a risk it didnt work out exactly like id hoped but i guess thats the inherent nature of risk sometimes it doesnt work
3415206 but i guess ive never finished a competition where i didnt feel that way there are a lot of positive things i can take from this
3415207 its like the old soviet days they were making an example of us for ukraine and others to see
3415208 what we need is to get out of a crisis i just want to push people to dialogue
3415209 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3415210 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored the aggressor has been punished and has suffered very considerable losses
3415211 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3415212 if we have received the order to ceasefire this does not mean that we have stopped all actions including reconnaissance
3415213 tskhinvali doesnt exist its like stalingrad was after the war
3415214 schools hospital houses all infrastructure is ruined theres no water no electricity we will rebuild it
3415215 i dont think russia will feel like talking with mr saakashvili after what he did to our citizens
3415216 no plans to force anyone from power this is not in our political culture at all
3415217 our technological innovations allow our reporters to be at the center of more breaking news events and developing stories across the united states with greater independence and mobility than ever before
3415218 this expansion is a critical component of cnn worldwides overall strategy for increased content ownership
3415219 everyone was saying that this team is not even going to make it to the second day we read all that yeah we did
3415220 we sat up in the computer lab and said we cant believe theyre writing this stuff we always knew at the least that we would be a team that would be in position to be looking at a medals podium
3415221 we talked every night we never stopped believing in ourselves
3415222 as far as im concerned this is gold for us
3415223 i said you guys this meet has been great regardless of what happens
3415224 i told them that i loved them no matter what happens
3415225 its every single tear shed and all the toil in my life the emotional heartbreaks it all seems worth it now
3415226 and theres my knee and im favoring my bad left ankle with my bad right leg which is where i had my knee surgery
3415227 i never would have expected it just a few weeks ago
3415228 personally i exceeded all my goals here today what a tremendous honor to be up on the podium at the olympic games

3415252 anyone can see this is not the case of the century the fact is that britney is being treated differently
3415253 this should be just treated as a fix it ticket or an infraction
3415254 accept both the demons it creates and the consequences of it
3415255 if i hadnt gotten these vip passes for free i would be pissed

3415259 it was really loud and rollicking everybody was keyed up the costumes were great the lyrics were funny and it was really good rhythmic bouncy music they kind of set the mood
3415260 oh hes screaming from his window and his screaming wont stop screaming i am not an animal and i am not an animal he cried
3415261 well i have a friend who looks like a bear whenever he throws his big hands in the air people tend to leave and people tend to cry he lives in a cave right down the street and this time of year youd think hed be asleep but hes not hes admiring his porcelain spoon collection his porcelain spoon collection
3415262 im kind of intrigued as to how they create their songs because its so well composed between so many of them i wonder if they have a central person whos really composing it
3415263 you can definitely hear that there are more musical brains going on in there
3415264 its like they took as much care as they could with the songs
3415265 the way i kind of think about it is that im right handed and with my left hand i kind of build this thing sloppily then i bring it to the band and i have no clue what were playing
3415266 they take this junk third grade drawing and when i get it back its beautiful
3415267 lets try something different tonight just bring a floor tom and a snare drum

3415269 the judge says because he cant locate the check its a moot point
3415270 its not moot in fact its time for the judge to come clean about the contribution then do the right thing and turn the money over to charity
3415271 to return the cash to the working oklahomans alliance would do no good for the aggrieved workers comp claimants
3415272 we suggest that murphy feed a few hungry oklahomans by donating this cache of cash to the regional food bank of oklahoma city an organization that serves hungry oklahomans throughout the state including feeding centers in senate district 21
3415273 this is only just as oklahomans from across the state unknowingly and unwillingly contributed to murphys campaign
3415274 the contribution was made on july 3 forty days ago were waiting to see how long it takes judge murphy to track down that elusive check and do the right thing well be watching
3415275 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3415276 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3415277 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3415278 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world

3415280 the total toy market has not grown during the period while the lego group has achieved a double digit growth rate in sales to consumers on many markets and increased its market share on all markets
3415281 people have reduced spending in their daily groceries new furniture or their summer holidays but they havent yet cut down the occasional shopping this behavior goes against the economic cycle
3415282 in addition the new licensed line lego indiana jones has sold extremely well especially on the north american market
3415283 the effect of the dollar is having a relatively profound effect over the wider metals complex
3415284 sentiments having a big impact whats driving the market at the moment is the fear of weaker economic growth in the united states and the europe
3415285 sometimes the cause and effect is difficult to define its a self perpetuating vicious circle going on where oil falls strengthens the dollar then the strengthening dollar forces oil down more

3415294 y en breve ya se podr escuchar recordemos que la gira
3415295 a quadro plex d series vcs can turn workstations and servers into
3415296 you need to record something like this because its not everyday you find something that looks like this running around out in the middle of the county
3415297 you know its just kind of one of those things to hear about and talk about but to actually see something on video that may actually be a live one thats pretty amazing
3415298 maybe its better to just think it is the chupacabra and just leave it at that
3415299 by moving the couch over to this side and the loveseat over here it will give us a bit more space
3415300 when the potential buyer comes in and they see personal photos they feel they are invading your space
3415301 i staged the house on friday and by noon sunday he had a contract
3415302 and this was after being on the market for seven months
3415303 once that for sale sign comes up in the yard your home becomes a product
3415304 and youre wanting it to stand out among the rest
3415305 every single unit has a water view of some kind whether its the reflection pools in the actual complex or the ocean
3415306 there are units there where you can actually swim up to the edge of your unit with steps that go up to a veranda
3415307 its second to none in townsville and there is nothing that will compare to it
3415308 its a very grand design and its very opulent without that opulent price tag unless you want to buy a penthouse
3415309 there is no reason why three or four families couldnt get together and buy them as tenants in common
3415310 say they were from mount isa collinsville or anywhere out of town they basically have the ability to have somewhere really nice and homey to stay
3415311 some people dont want to do a list because they dont want to make a menu
3415312 the time you take to plan your meals before heading to the store will pay for itself in results at the end of the week first make a list of healthy meals that fit your diet and are highly appealing
3415313 the participants who did the online ordering said it helped them stop impulse purchases and make healthier choices
3415314 you actually order less because you go look in the cupboard and make sure you dont have three boxes of rice already
3415315 its going to help you fill up more without the high calories on the main entree fruits and veggies fill your stomach without loading up calories
3415316 skip the bagel in the morning and fuel up with protein its going to stick with you longer
3415317 i really believe in eating the whole egg because there are some valuable nutrients in the yolk that you dont get other places so easily
3415318 consider that the healthiest foods in the supermarket the fresh produce are the ones that dont make fda approved health claims which typically festoon the packages of the most highly processed foods
3415319 the food label can be a consumers best shopping tool
3415320 you can compare nutrients and ingredients between similar products determine which nutrients the food contributes to your total diet safe preparation methods and much more
3415321 avoid portion distortion a muffin that you make at home would have 210 calories but the size you get in a bakery is 500 plus calories
3415322 there is a growing band of accidental millionaires out there who are profiting from property purely through good fortune rather than good design
3415323 they are the unexpected beneficiaries of one off anomalies in their local market which push values through the roof
3415324 no one in their wildest dreams least of all the residents themselves could have predicted the financial windfall that would fall their way
3415325 it may be lucky but the bottom line is it is just like lotto you have to be in it to win it
3415326 anyone who owns property could potentially become an accidental millionaire due to a completely unforeseen event
3415327 if you own a property no matter where it is you are holding a ticket in the draw
3415328 the difference with the general hotspotting process is that accidental millionaires are usually the beneficiaries of events that are totally unexpected and impossible to predict
3415329 these property owners stumble across unforeseen riches through no doing of their own except owning property
3415330 ben and his family are happy that this case has finally come to a close and that ben is now able to move on to the next chapter
3415331 the size of the award made by the court reflects his talent and potential as one of the brightest young footballers in the country
3415332 having said that ben would have preferred to earn this sum through a full career as a professional footballer
3415333 the club is falling apart and nobody knows how much longer shinawatra will hang around
3415334 it feels as though were in meltdown and all mark is trying to do is hang on to everything for the sake of the club
3415335 but if it carries on and players are sold without his consent he wont stand any more hell just walk
3415336 some harsh words were exchanged and mark left everyone in no doubt how he felt
3415337 i hope the community shield wont be the last trophy we win this season
3415338 weve worked hard in pre season and ive seen the hunger in the players eyes
3415339 we are ready to win more trophies because there exists a winning mentality at united
3415340 paul scholes gary neville and ryan giggs have been at the club for so many years but they are still so driven to win trophies
3415341 we saw in the community shield that they are ready to fight for every ball
3415342 gt lincoln residents bernard and anastasia behrends and postville courthouse volunteer coordinator shirley bartelmay right pose monday afternoon beside the new wayside exhibit funded by the behrends that was unveiled and dedicated today on the postville lawn
3415343 on may 8 1958 the first breaker was assembled and shipped from the brand new innovative cutler hammer manufacturing facility in lincoln
3415344 that year the plant was named as one of the ten top plants in the u s by factory magazine
3415345 a half century has passed millions of breakers metering devices loadcenters and air conditioning disconnects have been built and shipped thousands of people have walked through the doors representing the loyal and dedicated workforce that exemplifies the midwestern work ethic
3415346 the plant was built here in 1958 and they actually transferred work from a plant in new jersey that was outgrowing its building
3415347 weve evolved into sheet metal processing metering devices and loadcenters
3415348 i think that one of the reasons were still here is because we have changed a lot
3415349 we change when we have to and we have good support from our employees and good support from our corporation in terms of capital and keeping the plant up to date and efficient
3415350 i think the changes that weve been able to make have allowed us to stay viable
3415351 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3415352 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3415353 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3415354 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3415355 for god sakes have some courtousy i am aware that i lost both my arms but do you have to make such a big deal put down that god damn camera yankee and your kid just sneezed on my leg again give him a kleenex will you great my robe is slipping can somebody pull it up

3415358 with her tremendous athletic ability dance training and striking look we feel alison embodies all the assets required to be the live model of lara croft and we are really looking forward to working with her
3415359 those that work in the kitchen are kind to everyone but themselves
3415360 all we heard was a loud boom and we werent sure if it was the dumpster out back being emptied or a heavy truck traveling past our building or whatnot
3415361 in this world there is a tsar he is without pity hunger is his name
3415362 the horesman grasped him in his terrible hand and raised him in the air then laughed once more and flung his terrible prey into the abyss and all the corpses seized him and sunk their teeth into him
3415363 starting this morning we could not power on nor vmotion any of our virtual machines

3415368 women kind of wilt as men sort of achieve as they get older like wine or whatever
3415369 its like oh shes past her prime and she cant play a sex symbol
3415370 its just a preconceived notion about women in general and particularly in this industry its a very vain vain industry
3415371 when i went to the oscars it was like oh theres been an archaeological dig and look what weve found a 40 year old
3415372 the system in europe is nothing like in hollywood it is not so barbaric in terms of the ageing process
3415373 its been a challenging few years being the age i am
3415374 almost to the point where i felt like well they dont know what to do with me
3415375 we are stepping up and doing what we need to do to straighten this thing out
3415376 there are two good people that for different reasons arent part of this organization today and thats a shame
3415377 the fact is the players have to look deep inside themselves and understand they have to be responsible for some of this
3415378 am i angry we find ourselves in the situation we find ourselves in yes this is not a fun week the galaxy hasnt made the playoffs for a couple years punting on this season is not acceptable it starts thursday
3415379 i think this was a tough move professionally and personally for ruud
3415380 i dont think it was working out for him and his family i have no issues with ruud i appreciate what hes done for us and we move on
3415381 we respect cobi hes stepping in and filling a void whether or not cobis comfortable being the head coach or whether or not he has the experience well play that one by ear cobi certainly will have a voice in this
3415382 that said well see where we go with the head coaching position
3415383 i dont think were going to mandate or dictate that
3415384 we certainly could make a quick decision if thats whats necessary my guess is a lot of people will want to throw their name in the ring here
3415385 i think because of the ruud situation it was an opportunity to once and for all look for a fresh start
3415386 alexis been with us a long time im very appreciative of everything hes done for the galaxy that one is painful we havent made the playoffs for two years running and were headed for a third year you cant blame alexi entirely i do think we need a fresh start

3415392 after several tests we decided to put lin miaoke on the live picture while using yang peiyis voice
3415393 the reason for this is that we must put our countrys interest first
3415394 the girl appearing on the picture must be flawless in terms of her facial expression and the great feeling she can give to people
3415395 all the sites are opened on time and furnished the way they are supposed to be
3415396 weve worked very hard to remedy the problems we saw in 2006
3415397 there are two basic problems we run into with voters
3415398 one is that they show up tat the wrong polling place another is that they go to the wrong precinct table the passport system is particularly useful for those without a sample ballot

3415404 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
3415405 to the mall the playground playdates to target just to go somewhere
3415406 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
3415407 we just dont have as much money as we used to
3415408 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
3415409 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
3415410 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
3415411 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
3415412 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
3415413 we are not staying home with our children by default
3415414 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
3415415 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
3415416 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
3415417 but i dont think it would pan out in the end
3415418 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out
3415419 maybe it was my birthday in may last year not this year
3415420 to find a job that pays something decent i would still have to drive an hour each way at 4 30 a gallon
3415421 i go to five places in one day with three kids its horrible
3415422 how can we justify eating out when we could go to a store and buy enough for a couple days worth of meals
3415423 theres just no time to regroup none left for ourselves
3415424 im trying to work out a baby sitting swap arrangement with friends

3415429 at any concentration even 2 5 benzoyl peroxide can bleach fabric
3415430 even if you use a benzoyl peroxide cleanser and dont rinse well enough itll bleach your towel and sheets but it doesnt bleach your skin retin a can also stain because it has a preservative in it but generally if youre getting stains from using a retinol product chances are youre using too much
3415431 part of it is you do something rather than just talking about doing it its part of you
3415432 just doing that i got such a profound respect for the men and women of the armed forces and what theyre doing
3415433 the more i traveled the more i realized what a wonderful country we have and how blessed we are to live here
3415434 as an advocate for the university he raised funds from corporations and individuals as well as donating his time and financial support to ensure the success of the universitys mission
3415435 his dedicated service in support of the universitys international student program helped fund projects ranging from cultural tours to english language instruction the distinctive accomplishments of mr peacock reflect great credit upon himself the national defense university the national defense university foundation and the department of defense
3415436 one of the most important things i look for when i evaluate a healing community and i think has that raw material is how well they provide the holistic care to their patients do you go past just the automatic reflexive life saving intervention you made on somebody to open a closed artery and make sure it doesnt happen again do you educate the community do you see each patient as part of an army that can go home and share the lessons youve shared with them so they can pass on the information and if we can do this intelligently we can build an america thats a lot healthier to live in

3415441 mr suskind reports that the bush administration in its pursuit of war created and promoted forged documents about iraq

3415443 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
3415444 the farther we get in the process the more we use a qualitative judgment process
3415445 sen cochran feels confident in the proposal mississippi put forward
3415446 were sure that when people look at the strengths of the mississippi research facilities they will be convinced that we are the number one choice
3415447 it is no secret that mississippis entire congressional delegation is supporting this project
3415448 mississippi ought not to be criticized for having one of the most unified bipartisan and supportive congressional delegations in the nation some are trying to use the media to damage mississippis application the fact is mississippi and our consortium partners represent the best proposal
3415449 we had easy places to train staff and a pool of trained individuals ready to work in that kind of facility we thought we had a very strong proposal
3415450 within proximity to skilled research and technical staff with expertise and within proximity to training programs to develop skilled research and technical staff
3415451 in the end the critique we got back was the high density of skilled personnel would create a lot of competition
3415452 so itll be harder to find good people in maryland than anywhere else
3415453 the government is committed to providing comprehensive fire safety coverage in the capital hence it has planned the commissioning of more fire stations
3415454 i will adopt three poor girls from my village chincholi near shegaon taking care of their education and marriage put rs 1 million in fixed deposit to organize bhandara free meals for the needy and donate a car to tejaswi maharaj a saint from nearby village warodi this is what i can think of immediately

3415701 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3415702 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act

3415708 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us

3416117 what victorian treasury does is take into account all of the estimates theres always a range of estimates of growth
3416118 theres a lot of private forecasts some have been above 3 per cent some have been below

3416123 this trend is likely to continue and is a remarkable success story for software once ridiculed as unfit for corporate use the rise of linux in enterprises has so far come largely at the expense of older proprietary flavours of unix such as hewlett packard ux aix and solaris rather than windows although this is changing and the more direct open source challenge to microsofts market share is growing

3416125 we are trying to get an assessment of what a halt means and whether it is taking place of course
3416126 president saakashvili is the duly elected president of a sovereign democratic nation and so the determination of him as president is his decision and a decision for the georgian people and not for any outside nation to make demands on whether he is the appropriate person
3416127 the escalation on the part of the russia was disproportionate to their stated intentions
3416128 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3416129 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3416130 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3416131 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3416132 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling
3416133 thats why im glad finals are in the morning because you wake up you race and youre not sitting around thinking about it all day
3416134 i was totally clear not too many nerves excited but pretty calm it almost didnt feel like the olympic games that was probably good in a sense
3416135 we knew we were going to put up a fast time we just didnt want to screw it up
3416136 we were about as safe as you can get i basically waited until they touched the wall before i even started my windup
3416137 the fact he even went through that at trials and still came out on top way he did says so much about who he is and what he is
3416138 you hype it up so much in your head and then you get out there and youre like wow this is just another meet im here to do the same thing
3416139 but at the same time that was still a dream come true for me just to be able to race in the games
3416140 the first one is always the worst one to get under your belt im just glad that one is over with
3416141 im right where i need to be it was tough race but i know theres a little bit more in there
3416142 it was definitely difficult because last night was a finals situation
3416143 i really didnt have the focus i did yesterday i was just looking to get out of my heat ive got more races ahead of me that are more important
3416144 i just wanted to get to the semifinals and not make the same mistakes as athens so i went out hard
3416145 i think emotionally it probably did take a little bit out of me but ive been very careful about what ive been doing and reacting to that
3416146 just play it down and enjoy the moment and focus on the days ahead thats why i was trying to hold back a little bit so i didnt blow my tank and i can swim fast tomorrow morning
3416147 im fourth knowing that at the end i slowed down a bit so everythings cool
3416148 it was hard after losing the race yesterday but afterwards i realized i am happy with the silver medal
3416149 i was so excited the whole day it was just truly spectacular
3416150 now we need to move on and swim fast i know im capable of doing a lot and thats what i plan on doing
3416151 weve reached the point where caller personalization can be a standard capability that companies can offer to their callers

3416155 by using seals we have increased the number of hydrographic profiles 30 fold
3416156 what we know about the southern ocean is very limited which makes predicting the formation of sea ice difficult
3416157 these animals are filling a blind spot in our sampling
3416158 occasionally they stay long enough for the data loggers atop their heads to send the data via satellite
3416159 on average we can collect two profiles a day from each seal
3416160 in the antarctic when seawater freezes to form sea ice the salt usually suspended in the water is ejected into the water beneath the ice
3416161 we wanted to understand the foraging ecology of elephant seals and study their role in the marine food web
3416162 we think the seals at the bottom try to catch deep dwelling animals like squid and fish at these depths the seals lungs and body can be compressed to overcome the great pressures at 2 000m
3416163 what happened to all the people who used to work here all those who used to torture and kill what do they do with themselves with those skills where are they now

3416169 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3416170 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3416171 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3416172 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3416173 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3416174 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3416175 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation

3416210 we ask motorists to take care be patient and observe the safety speed limits while road works are under way
3416211 in an effort to minimise the impact to motorists were trying to keep things consistent during the day and schedule works needing major speed reductions at night or in off peak
3416212 this is a 1 billion plus project they really should be giving motorists a better deal
3416213 we are aware of the problem of covering old line marking
3416214 we are looking at what technology is available in the short term to make line marking clearer for the motorist before we do the final resurfacing of the whole road
3416215 during construction we are monitoring this and undertaking maintenance where and when required

3416225 obviously were aware there are pilgrims out there who have been given three month visas so it might well be at the end of those three months we see a spike in applications for protection
3416226 at this time we do not have the black hawk helicopters with sufficient protection to allow them to allow us to send them into afghanistan
3416227 we would not be able to achieve an ame aero medical evacuation with adequately protected helicopters until almost the middle of next year
3416228 i am concerned about increasing our overall commitment which would mean we could take a lead role in oruzgan from 2010 we already make a substantial contribution
3416229 well continue to watch them carefully and make sure the response is appropriate
3416230 we have a process that we run continually that just goes back and trawls through work thats been done and does another check to make sure everythings been done exactly as it should be
3416231 the guys have found an irregularity whenever we get that situation we have to make sure we have 100per cent done the work and if it affects an in service aircraft we withdraw that aircraft from service until were sure
3416232 sometimes you check things out and you find its all hunky dory and other times youve got to do some steps
3416233 we run an internal process to make sure we dont get into that territory
3416234 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3416235 its a very plausible possibility there could be some reduction in rates
3416236 the extent to which theyre quantified depends on the situation at the time
3416237 st george bank makes its own pricing decisions independent of everybody as a courtesy we alert people to those decisions after the decisions are made
3416238 the excuse they gave for lifting mortgages more rapidly than the rba lifted the cash rate was because of their blowout in things such as the bank bill rate relative to the cash rate which had some justification
3416239 not only is there a pretty compelling case for them to pass on the full rba rate cut but theres a case for them to pass on more than what the rba reduces the cash rate by
3416240 if the rba cuts by 25 basis points then depending on how the bank bill rate moves after that on current indications theres a case perhaps for the banks to cut the mortgage rate by 35 basis points
3416241 if that stayed down where it is now you could argue the case for them to pass on more like 40basis points if the rba eased by 25
3416242 given the sharp rally in local interest rate markets banks could cut mortgage rates today if they wanted
3416243 my guess is that major banks probably will pass through most if not all of the rbas first 50 basis points worth of cuts to headline mortgage rates
3416244 probably the best relations that have been there for quite some time
3416245 they of course had to hang saddam hussein for destroying several shiite villages
3416246 russian actions in clear violation of international law have no place in 21st century europe
3416247 no settlement can be just and complete if recognition is not accorded to the right of the arab refugee to return to the home from which he has been dislodged it would be an offence against the principles of elemental justice if these innocent victims of the conflict were denied the right to return to their homes while jewish immigrants flow into palestine and indeed offer the threat of permanent replacement of the arab refugees who have been rooted in the land for centuries
3416248 i will never accept a solution that is based on their return to israel any number i will not agree to accept any kind of israeli responsibility for the refugees full stop it is a moral issue of the highest level i dont think that we should accept any kind of responsibility for the creation of this problem
3416249 these operations can be carried out in the following manner either by destroying villages by setting fire to them by blowing them up and by planting mines in their debris and especially of those populations centers which are difficult to control continuously or by mounting combing and control operations according to the following guidelines encirclement of the villages conducting a search inside them in case of resistance the armed forces must be wiped out and the population expelled outside the borders of the state
3416250 the palestinian refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbors should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property which under principles of international law or in equity should be made good by the governments or authorities responsible
3416251 everyone has the right to leave any country including his own and to return to his country
3416252 state parties undertake to prohibit and to eliminate racial discrimination on all its forms and to guarantee the right of everyone without distinction as to race color or national or ethnic origin to equality before the law notably in the enjoyment of t he right to leave any country including ones own and to return to ones country
3416253 no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country
3416254 a just solution to the palestinian refugee problem to be agreed upon in accordance with un general assembly resolution 194
3416255 the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live in peace with their neighbors should be allowed to do so

3416257 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
3416258 i realize that there are conscientious parents who genuinely try to feed their children what they need but they should have no objection to filling out the forms we are introducing describing each of the meals they give
3416259 pro active steps are necessary to insure we are protecting all children
3416260 it is ridiculous not to monitor what all children are fed because of a misguided concern for privacy or freedom and such lack of regulation allows children to slip fatally through the cracks
3416261 parents cannot possibly keep up with each breakthrough in nutritional science and give their children these benefits
3416262 who knows what changes we may need to make next year to improve childrens nutrition
3416263 at a minimum homefeeding programs must be carefully monitored in the domicile to make sure all the latest advances are represented
3416264 during meals at the public cafeterias these children watch educational videos about crucial subjects like the environment sex and the evils of capitalism the food itself is culturally diversified and each day the children are taught a different set of table manners from another culture around the world
3416265 as recently as 1992 the majority of children in the united states were homefed
3416266 even when kids went to school they were allowed to bring lunches packed by their moms
3416267 yes there may be some impact on public hospitals but our estimate is that its likely to be modest

3416286 pierre bordieu desarroll la diferencia entre cultura y sociedad al mostrar en sus investigaciones que la sociedad est estructurada entre dos tipos de relaciones las de fuerza correspondientes al valor de uso y de cambio y dentro de ellas entretejidas con esas relaciones de fuerza las de sentido aquellas que organizan la vida social las relaciones de significaci n el mundo del sentido de las significaciones constituye la cultura por qu circulan hoy en el campo de la literatura juvenil tantos textos que toman el tema del otro del que es distinto qu significaciones se ponen en juego por qu estas tem ticas aparecen editadas en su gran mayor a despu s de la crisis pol tica y econ mica del 2001
3416287 escribo desde los perdedores porque me gusta hacerlo porque mi literatura sonar a falsa si lo hiciera desde otro lugar
3416288 de modo que cuando me naci la idea de escribir la historia de dos pibes de la calle no tuve m s remedio que hacerlo desde ellos o al menos desde lo que yo siento que ellos vivir an
3416289 dicho de otro modo no quise escribir un texto neutral quise s escribir una buena historia no s si lo consegu
3416290 nos resulta evidente que m s all de las representaciones de joven que estas novelas inscriben en su textualidad es posible leer en sus estrategias escriturales una representaci n de lectores poco asiduos c modos en tanto requieren de baja conflictividad est tica y tem tica para sentirse atrapados por un texto literario el circuito parece cerrarse en la convicci n de que el primer pacto de lectura de la literatura juvenil se establece con el mundo escolar con lo cual sta se publicita a trav s de cat lagos dirigidos a docentes
3416291 frente a esta oferta del mercado editorial nos interesa hoy orientar nuestra lectura a perros de nadie de esteban valentino
3416292 tanto la tem tica propuesta como las estrategias escriturales desplegadas dan cuenta de una serie de representaciones de la literatura y de los potenciales lectores que transgrede el c rculo de la identificaci n f cil y del realismo simplificador bombini 1993
3416293 la intertextualidad se presenta como uno de los recursos de escritura que m s fuertemente construye una representaci n de lector cr tico y competente en esta novela as encontramos en perros de nadie una diversidad de intertextos que remiten al imaginario colectivo pero tambi n a otros textos de la literatura
3416294 la ruptura de la linealidad temporal es otra de las opciones escriturales distintivas de esta propuesta narrativa en el caso de la novela que analizamos se registran diversas analepsis as perros de nadie se construye con distintas alteraciones en las que el relato retrocede en el tiempo para contar sucesos anteriores
3416295 en otra estrategia escritural desafiante perros de nadie construye su desenlace desde las elipsis y la alternancia de focalizaci n narrativa que permite al lector no s lo inferir el final de las historias de nueve y de bardo sino incluso tener cierta empat a con ellos
3416296 en este final hay otro recurso interesante es posible detectar una especie de fusi n de los discursos de narrador y personajes que va volviendo ambigua la procedencia de cada voz obviamente este recurso exige del lector un trabajo mayor de construcci n de sentidos en tanto a partir de esta confusi n de voces pensamientos y discurso puede entender c mo termina cada protagonista
3416297 ante todo me preocup de dejar en claro por si la novela llega a manos de alguien que est viviendo esta enfermedad que no es culpa de vidas anteriores que no hizo nada malo para que le sucediera que es una enfermedad un accidente de salud y es una enfermedad adem s que afecta a las personas no a las estad sticas
3416298 es un tema tab que no espera el joven encontrar una tem tica sobre la cual no se habla y ah es donde parece que quedan sorprendidos
3416299 ha sido tan importante la lectura en mi vida que a veces siento que la literatura me salv la vida
3416300 esa literatura no es una literatura que est marcada solamente con un se alador me marc a m y me dio esa luz al final del camino desde entonces aprend que cuando leo un libro puedo tener la suerte de encontrar otra salida
3416301 necesito estar muy s lida porque a m la literatura me retuerce cuando la escribo y tengo que poner el cuerpo para poder bancarlo me parece que por eso a veces algunos proyectos de escritura demoran tanto es que es in til lo confieso no soy yo casi siempre la literatura es quien me escribe a m
3416302 escribir sobre el c ncer en una jovencita de diecis is a os no es sencillo hay que tener agallas porque a esa edad la de la protagonista la vida est comenzando a escribirse
3416303 la novela describe sin caer en golpes bajos pero tampoco en facilismos atrapa como el tent culo porque la narradora tiene ese registro justo ese que hace que los j venes piensen que est n leyendo a un par
3416304 de mi infancia tengo un par de im genes que s lo con los a os habr a de entender un malv n que vi florecer en una casa abandonada sin riego y sin cuidados de nadie s lo por su propia voluntad de vivir y una estaca de la que se esperaba nada m s que hiciera crecer derecho un rosal y que sin embargo larg sus propios brotes humilde y en silencio
3416305 esta es la lecci n que nos propone la piedra de toque de montserrat del amo comprender que aquellos a los que err neamente llamamos discapacitados o minusv lidos son en realidad personas con capacidades trabajosamente desarrolladas para sobrevivir en el mundo brutal de los que nos creemos normales o personas cuando en realidad no actuamos m s que como gente
3416306 la piedra de toque abre muchas puertas para un abordaje multidisciplinario literatura biolog a derechos humanos educaci n c vica
3416307 apasionada por la escritura la literatura y la period stica sus novelas cambiaron el rumbo de la literatura juvenil y le abrieron el camino a los temas dif ciles la dictadura militar en as en la tierra como en el cielo y los ni os golpeados y maltratados en una autora comprometida con su tiempo y con la historia reciente
3416308 la lectura y la literatura han sido mi suelo y mi cielo y lo ser n siempre sin duda
3416309 creo que hay temas universales que se transmiten de generaci n en generaci n
3416310 c mo ves hoy el panorama de la literatura juvenil en nuestro pa s
3416311 creo que hay tres grandes cuestiones que son una tiene que ver con el mercado se est publicando demasiado y hay una generaci n de escritores que escriben lo que pide ese mercado lo que se puede vender hay escritores por prescripci n y los editores los eligen porque se dejan corregir recortar porque hay una concepci n desde la edici n de trabajar con la escuela y porque como consecuencia son maleables no tienen un concepto de lo que es literatura infantil y juvenil y subestiman a los chicos en este punto mi temor es que todo lo que se logr hasta ahora se desmorone dos hay una especie de virus que les da a las personas que nunca escribieron o que escriben para adultos que tienen un nieto o un hijo y le escriben un cuento que adem s le publican esto me parece una falta de respeto a los receptores tambi n tres hay una lij que resiste y es una de las mejores del mundo con grandes de verdad que hacen las cosas bien que tienen oficio no aceptan censuras y trabajan el lenguaje
3416312 soy terriblemente ca tica y escribo simult neamente dos o tres cosas y salto de archivo en archivo sea cual fuere el destinatario me gusta forjar el lenguaje usar recursos narrativos apelo mucho a la descripci n me meto en la historia leo al respecto si necesito olor a flores las consigo si necesito un lugar viajo si necesito historia me meto en ella pero por sobre todo trabajo la escritura la estructura suelo hacer varias versiones de cada libro no subestimo al receptor no dejo de decir nada me entrego a la escritura con mucha transparencia y pasi n
3416313 la novela de santa ana aparecida en 1998 pone en foco entre otros cosas la relaci n entre hermanos en una etapa de la vida en que todo es complejo informe y poco preciso la entrada en la adolescencia y esos dos hermanos que tienen que encontrar el puente para reconstruir un lazo en suspenso hacen de la diferencia su riqueza y su fuerza en un mundo en que parad jicamente lo diferente es algo estigmatizado y a veces visto como repudiable
3416314 no recuerdo demasiadas novelas en la que los lazos fraternos sean centrales pero lo cierto es que el narrador despliega a lo largo del relato las distintas etapas de una relaci n que empieza en la admiraci n heroica por el hermano mayor que se ha ido de casa para pasar por la rabia de saberlo enfermo la aceptaci n y finalmente un regreso a la admiraci n pero no ya heroica de la infancia sino la heroicamente humana del final
3416315 el sida es tratado de manera sutil e inteligente de hecho nunca se revela c mo se ha contagiado ezequiel no lo hace porque no importa lo nico que importa es c mo se enfrenta lo que queda y c mo se lucha y esto es mucho m s importante que detenerse a sopesar si se contagio por tal o cual camino o qu opinar n los dem s si se enteraran por qu est muriendo la enfermedad sirve m s para develar las reacciones de los otros frente a lo desconocido y dejar en evidencia el ego smo que conlleva la falta de solidaridad y de comprensi n
3416316 plantear para esta novela un solo eje de lectura es reducirla en la riqueza de sus sentidos desde lo gen rico cumple con los dos requerimientos de la novela de aprendizaje esto es el paso del h roe de un estado de ignorancia de s mismo a otro de conocimiento de s a trav s de una prueba de interpretaci n de lo vivido y por el otro el paso de la pasividad a la acci n
3416317 siempre se escuchan voces que dicen que la lectura no le interesa a nadie durante todo el verano en distintos puntos tur sticos del pa s la campa a nacional de lectura del ministerio de educaci n reparti libros publicaciones y organiz diversas actividades etruria quiso saber m s acerca de estas acciones para fomentar la lectura y decidi ponerse en contacto con margarita eggers lan quien accedi a la entrevista
3416318 las campa as de lectura deben sostenerse en el tiempo y obedecer a una pol tica de estado cuando es el estado quien asume la responsabilidad de sostener un derecho como es de leer y lo hace desde todos los flancos posibles el resultado es significativo
3416319 tal vez lo que diferencie espec ficamente es la entrega gratuita de material de lectura en enormes cantidades con un gran alcance a toda la poblaci n y los lugares a los cuales se dirige la campa a estadios de f tbol tax metros lugares de veraneo comedores salas de espera de consultorios etc
3416320 el acto de justicia de tener un material que cada habitante se pueda llevar a su casa es el punto distintivo
3416321 mariana furiasse nos presenta a rafaela una adolescente de 16 a os que llena su cuerpo que lo engorda con una ausencia y conserva en el viol n que dej su padre en la casa algo que suena y resuena desde su infancia la comida y su perra son sus nicas aliadas su madre es muy social demasiado por varias razones rafaela le da a la comida todos los valores la comida atraviesa su tiempo su espacio su mente come sin hambre come sin compa a y su personalidad explota a la vista de los otros que no pueden acomodar esta otra persona tan diferente a sus rutinas
3416322 rafaela aparece con su escritura en primera persona nos cuenta que m s que los kilos le pesan las miradas de los dem s y nosotros lectores empezamos a sostener algo que pesa m s que un libro
3416323 v ronique a diferencia de rafaela quiere volverse invisible conocemos su historia a trav s de gabrielle ellas se juntan por primera vez en el calendario al nacer las re ne la misma cl nica donde sus madres fueron a parir una al lado de la otra siguen en la vida amigas entra ables v ronique como en un juego se va proponiendo metas tantos kilos en tanto tiempo m ximo desaf o desaf o al m ximo pero pierde el reglamento y es entonces cuando el rigor y la tiran a de su imagen la empiezan a gobernar pierde gana la anorexia
3416324 sonia sarfati describe minuciosamente c mo es el camino de regresi n de una adolescente atrapada por la enfermedad duele pero rotundamente destaca la convicci n y el apoyo equilibrado de gabrielle quien hizo lo que se deb a hacer a pesar de que v ronique la hab a expulsado de su vida
3416325 en estas dos novelas la literatura denuncia y arroja luz
3416326 el manga es la historieta japonesa que surgi como una adaptaci n nipona al c mic occidental tratando de imitar los dibujos de walt disney de all que el rasgo m s distintivo de estos dibujos sean los ojos desmesuradamente grandes y expresivos
3416327 es un g nero muy amplio y popular que va ganando lectores alrededor de todo el mundo esto es gracias a la din mica de lectura y la vastedad de historias nuevas innovadoras e interesantes que van surgiendo d a a d a
3416328 estas historietas se leen al modo japon s de derecha a izquierda y de arriba abajo al autor se lo denomina
3416329 originalmente los mangakas publican sus trabajos en revistas semanal o mensualmente y luego las recopilan si han tenido mucho xito en tomos de aproximadamente doscientas p ginas llamados tankubon es en este formato como se recibe en occidente
3416330 es importante aclarar que no todos los mangas son para todo el mundo debido a que los distintos tipos van dirigidos a un p blico espec fico
3416331 en 1986 v ctor heredia present su obra taki ongoy la misma daba cuenta de las otras voces las de los pueblos originarios
3416332 fue declarada despu s de veinte a os de inter s educativo por el ministerio de la naci n
3416333 durante mucho tiempo se ha pretendido ocultar bajo la falacia del legado de una civilizaci n superior la enorme tragedia de los pueblos ind genas de los pueblos originarios de esta am rica mi obra no trata de enjuiciar a nadie la historia es lo que es ya no hay forma de modificarla como as tampoco podremos ignorar la potencia cultural que desde el castellano y el conocimiento cient fico y literario euro c ntrico nos hizo tal cual somos
3416334 ser a imposible negar todo ese torrente cultural que nos lleg de la mano de espa a colonizadora pero apunto que detr s de ese legado hay otro quiz mucho m s valioso para nuestro sentido de pertenencia y es el de las culturas precolombinas por qu perderlo
3416335 nac pobre hijo nico en la posguerra espa ola con un padre que jam s me cont lo que hizo en la guerra por miedo ni me habl de su pasado hijo ileg timo de una mujer sencilla y un hombre importante y adem s fui tartamudo lo ten a todo en contra pero me gustaba leer y leer me salv la vida
3416336 soy apasionado pero tambi n soy rom ntico y s que tengo una sensibilidad especial a flor de piel si no tienes esa sensibilidad aunada al hecho de ser escritor lees la noticia y te quedas s lo en eso yo veo m s all me hago preguntas interpreto por lo tanto parto muy a menudo de la realidad del horror humano y lo desnudo pero en el 99 de mis novelas hay siempre una palabra final esperanza
3416337 acabo de editar la p gina escrita mi m todo para j venes escritores

3416339 el fant stico es un eutopos un bello lugar donde dialogar con los sue os un reencuentro con lo no perdurable en el preciso instante en que nos decidimos a merodear mundos sin confines definidos
3416340 etruria les propone ascender o descender de las cumbres entrevistarse con lo veros mil detenerse en la constelaci n de los grandes maestros del g nero percibir la vacilaci n interna de la palabra viva y celebrar la par bola narrativa
3416341 cort zar dec a que lo fant stico es como un extra amiento algo que no se puede explicar con las leyes de la raz n como una excepci n de las leyes que dominan nuestra l gica y nuestra inteligencia tambi n aseveraba en el mismo art culo acerca de lo fant stico que la habitaci n de lo fant stico es el cuento y ejemplificaba sus afirmaciones citando cuentos de borges de felisberto hern ndez y propios
3416342 asimismo todorov intenta armar una teor a sobre el g nero una teor a que se le hace dif cil porque el g nero fant stico es un g nero de fronteras difusas y se vale de otros g neros para poder explicarse
3416343 y en cuanto a la selecci n de este n mero todo recorte implica dejar textos afuera muchos se preguntar n por qu no pusimos a jorge luis borges a cort zar y a otros autores porque son can nicos y creemos que casi todos los profesores y maestros de literatura trabajan con ellos y a nosotros nos gusta desafiar las barreras de lo seguro y proponer otras lecturas
3416344 y algo que me parece importante de este g nero es la invenci n del lector creo que junto con la subjetiva por naturaleza el g nero fant stico hace intervenir al lector de una manera particular la tensi n que crea el mundo narrado la rareza del hecho que se est contando hace que mantengamos en vilo hasta el final que sigamos leyendo atravesando p ginas que nos hagan sostener nuestra curiosidad que a veces se mezcla con un poco de miedo y con un poco de horror hasta el final del texto
3416345 la incertidumbre del fant stico hace que la novela o el cuento en cuesti n nos sorprenda siempre
3416346 la literatura fant stica nos puede mostrar lo il gico de nuestra l gica y tambi n puede abrirnos la mirada hacia otros mundos posibles
3416347 la escritura de textos fant sticos como ejercicio de composici n siempre es una tarea grata a los chicos y es el momento en que se pueden explicar someramente las diferencias entre lo estrictamente fant stico lo maravilloso lo sobrenatural la ficci n cient fica o el horror macabro como docente suelo ser generoso con todos aquellos que trabajan sus textos seriamente sin importarme mucho cu l de los muchos caminos que ofrece lo fant stico deciden probar s lo una cosa me hace perder los cabales y me transforma de profesor bonach n en un maligno mister hyde pedag gico que un alumno despu s de escribir un buen cuento fant stico lo arruine con la frase y al final se despert
3416348 la diferencia que se puede establecer entre las obras que perduran o las actuales que no est n fabricadas para el mercado con respecto al diluvio fant stico que es como una especie de literatura para televidentes con repeticiones y estereotipos y abuso de todos los recursos chabacanos es que su fin el de las buenas obras las que tienen un fin sin fin es absolutamente literario
3416349 la prosa de calvino es plena de destellos de instantes inolvidables que nos iluminan para siempre es este autor italiano un creador de milagros que dialoga con la eternidad y le encuentra identidad con un estilo ajustado a lo imprevisto a los confines por donde merodea la aventura y se multiplican las miradas
3416350 qu es el fant stico para calvino quiz una antigua mirada sobre la literatura g tica inglesa o su propia clasificaci n sobre el g nero lo visionario que permite concluir en la duda de un fant stico cotidiano donde la explicaci n racional se evapora y la llegada de elementos anormales genera todo tipo de temores y hasta la muerte
3416351 as como en los cuentos maravillosos de origen tradicional el n mero tres y la triplificaci n estructuran la historia m rgara averbach se inspira en la visi n hol stica de los pueblos indios de los estados unidos para construir un universo fant stico en el que la clave es el n mero cuatro los puntos cardinales marcan el rumbo de cada historia cada novela esta dividida en cuatro partes y cuarto son los magos que protagonizan una b squeda constante con todos sus desaf os
3416352 un relato fant stico nunca debe oponerse al mundo conocido m s bien debe ponerlo entre par ntesis de un modo sutil
3416353 siempre me gust mezclar los g neros armar los textos a partir de un enigma de algo que no se sabe un cuento o una novela siempre cuenta un secreto algo que no se sab a al principio
3416354 siempre estoy escribiendo alguna novela me es m s f cil inventar la trama y escribir a mano el primer borrador que pasarlas en limpio la escritura es para m una actividad en la que hay un elemento casi infantil de puro juego y otra fase adulta de correcci n de equilibrio de paciencia y responsabilidad
3416355 en 1940 adolfo bioy casares dio a conocer la que l considera su primera novela publicable la invenci n de morel
3416356 creo que lo esencial de su argumento remite al g nero fant stico con todo derecho y leerla desde l abre un espectro mayor que si la remitimos s lo a la ciencia ficci n porque los t picos que despliega son los que han configurado la tradici n de la literatura fant stica y que aparecen en todas las consideraciones del g nero
3416357 el tono de la novela es seco y efectivo pero los t picos combinados remiten a la tradici n del fant stico combin ndolos en una matriz m s aparentemente racional pero que en realidad instalan y reformulan esas reglas o leyes que se le piden al g nero fant stico que arranque al lector de la comodidad del mundo conocido que lo someta a la ambig edad y la zozobra que lo haga vacilar en sus certidumbres que acepte mientras dura la lectura las grietas que pueden abrirse en la c scara l bil de lo cotidiano
3416358 cuando se plantea un debate moral es dif cil responder hasta d nde es posible adaptar sin traicionar a un texto y cu l es el margen de maniobra para el guionista quien adapt una obra literaria alguna vez sabe que existe un delicado equilibrio entre lo tico y los est tico a la hora de tomar decisiones por eso las respuestas se encuentran durante el proceso de trabajo
3416359 a la hora de escribir un gui n adaptado hay que resolver varias dificultades hay que cortar abreviar sintetizar a adir dilatar y complementar situaciones hay que resolver cuestiones ligadas a la dramaturgia como la divisi n en actos el ritmo los decorados hay que resolver la puesta en escena poner personajes en acci n armar una nueva estructura y todo bajo la propia premisa en definitiva hay que hacer pr cticamente una obra nueva
3416360 se dice con raz n que una adaptaci n muy fiel al texto traiciona al cine y que una demasiado libre traiciona a la literatura
3416361 ver una adaptaci n y aceptar un nuevo punto de vista enriquece nuestra percepci n ya que nos permite ampliar la visi n sobre un hecho determinado adaptar no significa ser fiel al original sino todo lo contrario pensemos que la audacia y la conciencia de quien trabaja con la idea es determinante para la pel cula de esta forma comprenderemos que muchas de nuestras cr ticas tienen un punto de partida equivocado
3416362 creo que es absurdo indignarse por la p rdida de calidad de una obra literaria cuando es llevada al cine ni siquiera en nombre de la literatura ninguna adaptaci n puede producir da o en la obra original por el contrario muchas veces los espectadores de cine se interesan por los textos y la literatura gana en ventas en otras ocasiones ocurre lo contrario nadie pierde nada en este camino
3416363 hay bell simas escenograf as dentro de tu obra desde d nde se recrean
3416364 los paisajes de la saga los extensos y los dom sticos no est n recreados desde el conocimiento geogr fico y cultural que suelen procurar los viajes en casi todos los casos se trata de paisajes internos construidos a trav s de la lectura el trabajo de rastreo bibliogr fico me llen de im genes y al mismo tiempo me otorg libertad para trabajar con ellas en funci n ficcional nunca a pesar del intento por honrar el referente americano tuve intenci n de hacer una reconstrucci n hist rica y geogr fica estrictas
3416365 cu les son las ausencias que convocan a la polifon a de tus personajes
3416366 creo que siempre escribimos desde la ausencia desde las carencias desde el primer momento de mi escritura pens en la ausencia de justicia para con los pueblos originarios y sus descendientes pens en la necesidad todav a insatisfecha de realizar reconocimiento pleno de uno de los m s grandes genocidios de la historia desde lo literario me convoc la carencia de un relato pico y m gico sobre nuestro continente en tiempos de la conquista espa ola desde lo personal la ausencia de seres amados a los que les deb a este intento
3416367 cu l es la idea de belleza dentro de tus relatos
3416368 en la saga de los confines casi no hay feos creo que la fealdad es un invento del prejuicio de la tristeza del desamor la belleza tiene que ver con la propia y plena aceptaci n la belleza tiene que ver con la diversidad
3416369 mis brujas forman una sociedad femenina que coexiste al margen de la realidad en ella los rangos y jerarqu as no son disputados a los hombres sino repartidos entre las mujeres
3416370 mis protagonistas son profesionales que abordan con entereza su profesi n su vida privada y sus compromisos ideol gicos todo ello conlleva contradicciones triunfos y tambi n p rdidas estoy hablando de mujeres de carne y hueso de madres hijas y abuelas que se reprochan unas a otras sus equivocaciones pero que al fin se ayudan y se reconocen en sus flaquezas
3416371 por qu crees que la gente sigue leyendo literatura fant stica
3416372 responde al deseo humano de explicar el mundo construyendo un imaginario que supla nuestra ignorancia
3416373 en este autor los personajes protot picos de la literatura infantil cambian de funci n presenta conductas en los adultos opuestas a las socialmente establecidas o esperadas en su obra abunda el humor que llega al sarcasmo y rosa lo macabro y lo que m s me gusta es que ve al ni o con la mirada de un ni o a qu me refiero dahl construye con su literatura una idea de la soledad que siente un ni o del dolor del mal y del hambre hay varios donde los personajes son muy pobres y tienen hambre que se asemejan a la mirada de cualquier chico
3416374 la literatura de dahl atraviesa el g nero fant stico en su frontera con lo maravilloso y lo hace con maestr a y genialidad con una genialidad tal que ve a en el maestro y en los adultos a los enemigos que los ni os deb an combatir tal vez su maestr a resida en que siempre estuvo del lado de los ni os
3416375 ang lica gorodischer es muy elegante para escribir si bien no se ha concentrado en hacerlo espec ficamente para ni os o adolescentes su estilo es llevadero y sobrio sin embargo tiene ciertos recursos de la literatura infanto juvenil como por ejemplo hipersimplificar hasta lo est ril explicaciones de estructuras u objetos fant sticos que ella misma se encarga de poner en nuestro camino creo que esta particularidad a la que me vengo refiriendo justamente radica en el tema elegido el imperio m s vasto inabarcable que haya existido en consecuencia no se responde a un concepto lineal nada se afirma de manera categ rica la duda es sembrada en todo momento esa p tina hist rica es una constante en todos los cuentos provocada quiz s por el nico personaje presente a lo largo de toda la obra el narrador con una buena pero no infalible memoria que olvida y recuerda seg n los designios de la autora todas las historias est n contadas por este narrador atemporal como una voz anciana que habla siempre del pasado y trasciende la imposibilidad de conocerlo todo
3416376 en resumidas cuentas dos cosas encuentro en esta honestidad fant stica de ang lica gorodischer la primera tiene que ver con que kalpa imperial es fantas a pica pura sin ninguna pretensi n ni hilo conductor y quiz s en eso radique su genialidad no hay historia central ni portador ni misi n ni enmienda moral ni magia ni nada lo que tenemos es un archivo hist rico de vivencias de naturaleza humana de lucha por el poder y de intensa b squeda de respuestas que no llegan la segunda radica en que es completamente original kalpa imperial no sabe a nada m s que a kalpa imperial
3416377 las personas con capacidades diferentes en este caso puntual relacionadas con la visi n cuentan con bibliotecas especializadas para cubrir sus necesidades intelectuales y recreativas
3416378 en la ciudad aut noma de buenos aires funcionan la biblioteca argentina para ciegos y la biblioteca del libro parlante ambas cuentan con infinidad de obras grabadas que abarcan todos los g neros y las tem ticas
3416379 la literatura fant stica cuenta con un nutrido sector donde conviven borges cort zar tolkien bioy casares calvino y otros muchos que conforman un cat logo variado y selecto de autores
3416380 durante los d as 4 5 y 6 de mayo de 2007 las bibliotecas populares de nuestro pa s y sus bibliotecarios estuvieron de fiesta el motivo de la celebraci n fue el encuentro nacional de bibliotecas populares en el cual estuvieron presentes para conversar e intercambiar opiniones con los bibliotecarios mediante conferencias charlas y debates mempo giardinelli n stor garc a canclini osvaldo bayer carlos ulanovsky liliana hecker entre muchos otros
3416381 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3416382 in exchange for release of all past present or future liability the tigers baseball team agrees to pay season ticket holder stephens 35 000 00

3416390 why absolutely no transaction from the tag should be trusted
3416391 we are profoundly concerned that huds proposed respa rule will hinder rather than help the recovery of the housing market
3416392 we request that hud withdraw its proposed respa rule and immediately commence a joint rulemaking process with the federal reserve board
3416393 we believe that respa reform cannot be resolved in one sweeping change without considering and appreciating the many moving parts of a residential real estate transaction
3416394 recent events demonstrate that borrowers also need additional clarity about the terms and cost of credit which falls under the feds responsibility under tila
3416395 for that reason we strongly believe that hud should link its efforts with the board of governors of the federal reserve so that both agencies work together in a careful coordinated and comprehensive manner to truly simplify and improve the mortgage process for consumers
3416396 simplify clarify and reduce the cost of the mortgage and real estate settlement process
3416397 im sure my wife didnt realise her message would be public knowledge or that youd get access to photos
3416398 its just such a good example of what can go wrong
3416399 just as a good athlete does clearly steve young as a quarterback has thought a lot about which receiver he wants to throw to in what situation but when hes out on the field its become so ingrained that he does it automatically in the same way good salespeople who are adaptive do it automatically too for others it takes time to learn these skills ideally both groups get to a place where they dont have to think about it anymore
3416400 when sales executives and managers get together to discuss and swap experiences they can work on establishing some generalized principles
3416401 lets say for example that a pharmaceutical salesperson has a new product line hes been selling for a month in that time he notices that his customers who are primary care physicians care more than other doctors about one of that drugs particular benefits or perhaps the manager has noted that small private practice physicians have more concerns about one products costs compared to other customers this is information that can benefit everyone on a sales team but there has to exist some means to catalog and disseminate it to the other salespeople
3416402 think about what went right what went wrong and what you would do differently the next time what you want to do is figure out what was it that i did that worked and why did it work with this type of person so then when you confront that situation again youll know to try the same approach
3416403 will attribute their poor performance to something thats beyond their control they may blame the customer their manager the product the weather anything or anyone besides themselves so then they say i dont have to learn how to be better its something i cant control this contrasts with capable salespeople who believe that they can always improve and that results are within their control these salespeople always want to learn to do things better and deal with a variety of circumstances
3416404 when you walk out of a call with a salesperson dont say this is what you should have done and then give your opinion of what he or she did wrong instead ask what do you think went well what can we do better next time does this remind you of any sales situations youve encountered before good salespeople think about these things and good managers get their salespeople to think that way

3416486 if congress can do whatever in their discretion can be done by money and will promote the general welfare the government is no longer a limited one possessing enumerated powers but an indefinite one subject to particular exceptions

3416488 it is a principle incorporated into the settled policy of america that as peace is better than war war is better than tribute
3416489 for the same reason that the members of the state legislatures will be unlikely to attach themselves sufficiently to national objects the members of the federal legislature will be likely to attach themselves too much to local objects
3416490 the legislative department is everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex
3416491 a universal peace it is to be feared is in the catalogue of events which will never exist but in the imaginations of visionary philosophers or in the breasts of benevolent enthusiasts

3416506 though mortgage mail volume remains far lower than a year ago this is the first uptick weve seen in two years

3416517 im looking at this period as one of those that i am coming out stronger with experience and im putting a lot more things together im making things happen on the golf course
3416518 its a long way to catch tiger at the top
3416519 but i know that the only way of focusing on doing that is focusing on me controlling what i can do thats the only thing i can ask of myself
3416520 i obviously hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem
3416521 to believe that i achieved something they hadnt is very special

3416778 and it has been especially interesting and valuable to learn about the strategies of brazilian trade union leaders in dealing with vale management and the way brazilian unions are building a union network inside of brazil and how they are building community support and involvement around issues of the environment and balanced economic development at some point in the future after we get the kind of collective agreement our members deserve im looking to be part of a steelworker delegation to brazil that would allow us to experience first hand how brazilian workers build workers power and deal with vale on their home turf

3416825 we wanted it to be like a community fair like our own little block party but contained within the store
3416826 weve always had this idea of doing a 72 hour store and this seemed like the perfect time to celebrate

3416828 i would love to design something for gymnastics and the swimming would be fun because its so little but it can be so much
3416829 totally id love to do something really graphic in black or blue for gymnastics or ice skating
3416830 i understand its a performance and people are viewing it from afar and thats why they put all the bells and whistles on them but think they can be equally effective if they were like really graphic and well designed
3416831 its a fascination with egypt like francophile but were doing it in a subtle way so that its wearable

3416834 our original plan was to review the companys financial package but we quickly realised that we could achieve greater efficiency gains through the implementation of an automated document management system
3416835 we were tasked with reducing the amount of paper that was physically being processed and stored in the business
3416836 by investigating the value of automating our inbound invoicing and billing we could comply with this business aim while also driving the larger corporate strategy of reducing costs and reducing our carbon footprint

3416839 five years ago president bush challenged americas innovators to develop new hydrogen technologies to help reduce our nations dependence on oil and today we have a fleet of hydrogen vehicles making their way across the country
3416840 these hydrogen vehicles are the non polluting cars of tomorrow and they are being demonstrated today on our nations roads
3416841 the technology necessary to put these cars on the road and keep them moving exists today
3416842 the question is not if hydrogen powered vehicles will be available commercially but when
3416843 hydrogen is part of a balanced and diverse energy portfolio that will help address our future energy environmental and economic security needs
3416844 this tour provides americans an opportunity to see what the future could hold for hydrogen powered vehicles as we work to help make these vehicles cost competitive and available for all
3416845 our primary focus right now is on ensuring the safety and security of our students and fully investigating these allegations which we consider very serious
3416846 in addition to the offices mentioned above the college of liberal arts and sciences and the rape victim advocacy program have worked together to ensure that these allegations are investigated thoroughly fairly and professionally
3416847 its much better for employee morale if a small business owner never offers health benefits than it is to offer them and then be forced to take it away because it is too expensive to continue
3416848 small business owners experience considerable turmoil in their early years they often experience cash flow problems and are reluctant to incur additional expenses such as health insurance whats new to this picture is that it appears that new small business owners are waiting longer or choosing not to offer health insurance benefits to their employees at all
3416849 the vast majority of those who benefit from pay or play mandate live in families with incomes twice the poverty line or more and depending on how coverage is determined the mandate will leave a significant share of the working poor ineligible for such benefits either because their hourly wage rate is too high or they work for smaller exempt firms

3416853 we are pulling out all the stops to deliver a more efficient package for customers who need the capability of full size pickups and suvs and want the very best fuel economy
3416854 our pickups and suvs are already the fuel economy leaders of their respective segments but our engineers knew greater efficiency was achievable we fast tracked the xfe models to get them into dealer showrooms as quickly as possible
3416855 in addition to the xfe models gm already offers hybrid versions of the tahoe and yukon that achieve up to a 50 percent improvement in city fuel economy and coming in the first half of 2009 are the silverado and sierra hybrids
3416856 these hybrid pickups offer up to 25 percent overall increased fuel economy and greater than 40 percent improved mileage in city driving
3416857 there are thousands of models like all other models naomi campbell is the same way

3416861 they think that early humans domesticated wild wolves to make them useful companions and work animals since that time selective breeding has produced the many varieties of domestic dogs some of which are very un wolflike in appearance and habit
3416862 canis familiaris is the scientific name for the domesticated dog he belongs to the same genus as the wolf canis lupus scientists after many years of controversy now agree that wolves were domesticated about 12 000 years ago by various indian tribes throughout the world
3416863 although wolves and dogs are both members of the canid family wolves rarely bark

3416874 i would say that without getting the business background it would have been fairly impossible to take an invention anywhere
3416875 so what we had to do is start teaching entrepreneurship to engineers
3416876 not so long ago if an engineer had a small invention he would just hope that there would be someone on business side that would recognize brilliance and see the application
3416877 most of the time it would have died right there
3416878 to help develop and motivate the next generation of energy entrepreneurs
3416879 what we try to do in terms of the course is to give them the sense that there is a structure in place for how to present your ideas
3416880 we give them a framework for how to approach business situations
3416881 ability to analyze problems in a different way by focusing on a need in the market and working backwards to an invention
3416882 visual studio 2008 sp1 and the net framework 3 5 sp1 had an extremely positive impact on our ability to develop a web based application that our customer misys healthcare systems could use to manage patients records in fact it helped us boost development speed by 60 percent
3416883 the microsoft asp net ajax improvements and new capabilities such as ado net entity framework and ado net data services meant we didnt have to worry about any of the underlying plumbing and could simply focus on building a highly responsive and interactive experience for users
3416884 the beauty of the net framework has always been that it makes it easier for developers to build applications that are visually stunning well connected and highly secure
3416885 however we want to make sure we are keeping the end user experience in mind as well which is why we created the net framework client profile the net framework client profile significantly speeds up the installation of windows and enables a much more consumer friendly experience this is a huge step forward for the more than 4 million net developers worldwide
3416886 using the entity framework has significantly sped up our development cycle by removing a lot of the custom code we have to write
3416887 the entity framework took away the tedium of having to write standard data access code and business objects which gave our team a big productivity boost

3416960 at least one deal on the table that will move bryan out of toronto
3416961 all is not as quiet as it appears and a major announcement will take place in the next 7 10 days that will define sundins future
3416962 however i dont think the teams have the slightest idea what team he will pick
3416963 sundin is playing this year in the nhl however we have yet to see the scope of the bidding at this point since sundins statement in early july many more teams are in the game he is a high powered addition and certain teams do believe he is the missing piece
3416964 look out for colorado with mats i am not convinced that sakic and sundin arent talking or in on something together
3416965 it is a tough sell to let him back to the preds if for some reason he does decide to return the preds fans and the people in tennessee feel completely betrayed here they will let him go for almost nothing based on principle there is a reason terrell owens has never played for the titans that game wouldnt fly here
3416966 two big time arguably future all star forwards are on the table but there is more to it than that dig deeper and you will find another team is trying to snag the montreal kid and may have a better package to offer
3416967 there are some pretty confused people by many of fletchers moves and yet it also is widely looked at that cliff may actually be setting things up to stay in the gm role for a while

3416969 its complicated in my contract with s dert lje there was an clause that said i could go to the nhl before june 15 but the rangers werent able to sign me as a free agent until after july 1 i thought id be free to go because i agreed to a deal with the rangers in june but s dert lje stopped the transfer they said i was a far too important player for them to let me go
3416970 i understand s dert ljes position and ive got a good contract with them too

3416978 the company confirmed the slips and appears unlikely to deliver as much upside revenue upside as we had modeled previously
3416979 notwithstanding the game slips and the likely delay of a return to profitability for another year

3416992 the influx of bangladeshi nationals who have illegally migrated poses a threat to the integrity and security of india the frro is duty bound to take all necessary measure
3416993 on account of variety of reasons including religious and economic it is difficult to make a realistic estimate of the number of illegal migrants

3416999 in the decades of the 1980s there was a very rapid reduction in poverty
3417000 the decade of the nineties and the beginning of the two thousands the last 15 years has been a little slower but theres still been a perceptible decline
3417001 we are not including people who do not have access to running water sanitation schooling health and education they may well not have any of these things yet still not be considered poor because they earn enough to have the minimum calorie requirement
3417002 this is the tragedy of indian policy the government is sitting there paying its teachers and they dont turn up to school
3417003 what is happening is that as the country prospers the willingness of educated and skilled people to stay in the villages is going down
3417004 the first is not to resort to the use of force the second is to halt all military action the third is free access to humanitarian aid the fourth is that georgian armed forces should return to their bases the fifth is that russian armed forces should pull back to their positions prior to combat
3417005 the sixth is the beginning of international discussions on the future status of south ossetia and abkhazia and on ways to ensure their security
3417006 they will give an unequivocal answer an answer that cannot be given by russia or any other country
3417007 as to the statement made by the georgian president that a ceasefire has been in place for two days this is a lie
3417008 if russia had had another way to react to georgias aggression against south ossetia we would have done this there was no other way to respond
3417009 bullies differ from normal people in that when they sense blood its very hard to stop them and then one is forced to employ surgical methods
3417010 has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3417011 it is highly probable that this time the duma will recognize south ossetias and abkhazias independence
3417012 legally both abkhazia and south ossetia have more of a basis than kosovo to claim independence
3417013 turkey has the turkish republic of northern cyprus not officially recognized by the international community so russia will have two of them said alexei makarkin vice president of the center of political technologies a moscow think tank
3417014 will mean that the two republics will never again be a part of georgia which would eliminate the very problem of its territorial integrity
3417015 russias recognition of south ossetias and abkhazias independence would open natos doors to georgia and foreign troops will be deployed there in addition georgia could provide all out support to any terrorists separatists and extremists who made a request
3417016 while russia was sending humanitarian aid packages making efforts to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and trying to oust georgian forces from south ossetia it kept to international law and its international commitments and cannot be blamed for it now but further shelling of georgias territory and recognizing the two self proclaimed republics would strip russia of its current moral superiority at least within the cis
3417017 10 or 15 billion rubles is a negligible amount for the russian budget russia wont even notice
3417018 cnn the bbc and other major news channels have direct influence on the size of that influx and these channels are not presenting a very good image of russia
3417019 fluctuations following unexpected major events are typical of any market
3417020 a war is always more costly for a small economy said ruslan pukhov director of the center for analysis of strategies and technologies think tank
3417021 even before the war flared up russias economic blockade was costing georgia a lot ordinary georgians whose salaries are not paid by the government were hardest hit the war is yet another blow to the economy it will require a rise in government expenditure and compensation to the families of those killed or injured in the conflict
3417022 in armaments our army is as good as georgias but we are woefully inadequate in technical command and control equipment
3417023 night vision devices and high quality communication facilities are things we do not have

3417025 the expenditure in the military industrial sector was set in line with the requirements of the 2007 2015 state program for weapons development and all extra programs suggested by the siloviki have been turned down by the finance ministry
3417026 the batumi port has shut and is only accepting freight for storage but we have evacuated all our tankers and dry cargo ships from it
3417027 we decided to halt exports along this route until the situation stabilizes
3417028 georgia has been playing an increasingly important role in transiting crude oil and petroleum products mainly to europe in the past 5 10 years that country is considered by several major international oil and gas projects as one of the possible routes to transit fuels from central asia to international markets including to the black sea states
3417029 the geopolitical instability in the caucasus could push producers to use other oil transportation routes
3417030 it is also true of russian gas shipments across the black sea south stream and blue stream
3417031 most of the pipeline projects considered by the international community including those involving georgia had political motives rather than economic ones final decisions will therefore be made based on political practicalities which havent changed
3417032 the best thing for gazprom neft would be a vertically integrated structure for the delivery of oil products which could be secured by buying a stake in the mmg but we are also considering the option of purchasing individual filling stations to form a chain
3417033 when a company is assessed the focus is usually placed on output and current oil prices besides in buying a complete chain gazprom neft will also get an up and running logistic base

3417043 well i think the shows earlier years on the wb are clearly better than those last two seasons on upn the supernatural elements were perfect metaphors for the difficulties our young people have in high school and when buffy saved the world from the evil glorificus her sacrifice was the logical end to her service on this earth after she was resurrected the mood changed and despite the musical episode i dont think all that gloom and doom sent the right message i mean did they even finish college i dont think so
3417044 despite the emergence of the brown lippa lachiusa triptych and younger diy voices like lopez marx and joe iconis and in the post larson era no one writing today even approaches the emotional depth harmonic complexity and the spiritual clarity evident in the work of the still living legend stephen sondheim maybe adam guettel but he supports drilling

3417052 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history

3417058 i can copy him but i dont think i could be as good as phelps
3417059 theyve been resting all week and just gearing themselves up for one race where every time michael gets up on the block he has to gear himself up for his performance that night or that morning

3417071 this would undermine current environmental initiatives and would be at odds with the reviews objectives
3417072 im not sure i can get back to my basement to re charge i might die right here in this rotten apartment if you dont help me i need your light to heal me baby boy

3417075 im whats known as an active link beings more powerful than you can conceive of who are directly involved in the fate of this planet
3417076 youre a jewel georgias still gone but that beautiful coat of yours janine i want to feel its silk lining again on the floor underneath us
3417077 but to tell you the truth im getting antsy i need to go its best if i wake up in my own bed do you understand i hope you dont mind i havent been able to concentrate at work and theres a pile of stuff waiting for me
3417078 thats ok but i have a favor to ask remember i told you how georgia and i burned everything from the past including our ids well things are getting tight for me now i may be coming up against the creepy men who never smile do you understand the ones who swoop down out of the sky in black helicopters without asking questions ill have to move fast it would help tremendously if im carrying some kind of identification do you have any ideas
3417079 youre not in trouble are you do you need more money here
3417080 good isaac i have to tell you that the last time we were together after i gave you that money i felt lighter than air it freed up something inside me janine the controller exhaled and rolled overboard into the ocean
3417081 isnt that wild thats the image that came and it stayed with me all day at work swimming naked in the sea one of the worst days ive had in a long time by the way i almost quit for gods sake can you imagine that i really did i fantasized about taking you away with me flying down to the caribbean playing with the dolphins never returning but then i came to my senses i love my work id be lost without it i mean normally when i go on vacation after two or three days i cant wait to get back like that cabin i have upstate i hardly ever use it
3417082 and im so happy i gave my cross to you i never would have done something like that before we met its very special i wore it every day for years and years how liberating just to give it away
3417083 im not sure isaac not exactly my kettle of fish although come to think of it i do know some people in the bahamas offshore banking theyre pretty sleazy this one guy owes me a favor or he will after tomorrow
3417084 thats good it just has to be soon is all
3417085 actually my name is isaac and i know you from somewhere
3417086 if you dont get lost in the next ten seconds
3417087 i remember now on houston street wasnt it during that hot weather at the end of january georgia and i ran into you you tried to latch onto us you thought you recognized her from down in mexico tulum
3417088 adonis how could i forget a name like that adonis god of youth and beauty
3417089 you dont own me your image of me as your consort all that garbage its just your projection i belong to adonis
3417090 remember the last time we saw each other in the hallway outside the old mans apartment you begged me not to go down there but i did and when he opened the door you called him papa well hes a lot more than just your father something really heavy is going on sweetheart i need your help
3417091 youre nothing you revel in it but its a black hole thats eating you up you saw the light radiating from us that day and it drove you crazy you wanted to suck the light right out of us you sensed the goddess standing there on that sidewalk and you tried to glom onto her with your phony story about tulum youre consumed by your own darkness you cant see a way out you believe youre stuck forever what a hell realm
3417092 but i know where it all started adonis i see your childhood i see so much cruelty and abuse you think its impossible to change you think you dont deserve to change but i know otherwise i see the tender boy inside you fearful and alone crying out for someone to love him he never went away you know hes been hiding in there your whole life
3417093 that light you want you can have it for the time that remains to you but its your choice a choice you have to make now because youre dying adonis dont try to deny it either you risk changing or in another couple of months six at most am i right your liver something im sorry angel
3417094 let me be your dog isaac please whatever you want just dont abandon me
3417095 i know you have a room someplace in the city go there for seven days see no one else face yourself its up to you theres nothing i can do for you now but im trusting you adonis im going to give you our address a week from now come to us your new life will begin then
3417096 we have to go now my darling i told you i need your help and you need mine thats the way it is
3417097 i wanted to come back here but i couldnt figure out how to do it i sat on the curb until he rushed outside and it all started up again
3417098 no its not i lost my way with adonis i dont know what happened i cant remember how you and i got separated i cant remember where he came into the picture i cant remember how long i was with him but out there on the street when you mentioned standing in the hallway i instantly turned into a little girl again i could feel it in my body looking up at my father with adoration wanting him to love me wanting it so bad
3417099 and even then at that age i knew how sick he was cruel and heartless but i would have done anything for his approval for his acceptance why is that
3417100 listen nobody knows who they are thats the big secret its just that most people refuse to admit it theyll do anything to keep from falling into that hole so believe it or not the fear youre feeling is good because if you can pop it then youre free then not knowing who you are is liberating
3417101 you dont get it the undertow was too strong it pulled me out to sea i was drowning with adonis totally lost what kind of freedom is that
3417102 just breathe georgia whatever thoughts arise know that they dont own you i have a mind but im not my mind i have emotions but im not my emotions i have a body but im not my body and wheres that smile
3417103 do you know about scrying its when you journey by using another persons eyes as the jumping off place the field of vision look directly into my eyes georgia youre going to journey to the upper world where a spirit guide awaits you a being of light who cares about you take your time we have all day all night now you find yourself in a luminous expanse look around you see many different beings theyre all smiling at you wordlessly you inquire which one is your guide he or she approaches you ask for help ask for cleansing for renewal trust this let yourself go
3417104 because i found a friend up there someone who loves me unconditionally who accepts me he said i have every reason to be proud he told me the goddess lives inside me always even if i sometimes forget even if i lose track he said no blame no matter what happens no blame and he showed me how to get out of my own way how to let the goddess take her rightful place
3417105 we lost track of each other didnt we but now were together thats what counts im exhausted it feels wonderful to be home and that beard isaac it looks great never shave it off
3417106 in previous simulations this region came out smooth but now we have enough detail to see clumps of dark matter
3417107 some of those clumps are so dense they will emit a lot of gamma rays if there is dark matter annihilation and it might easily be detected by glast
3417108 there are several candidate particles for cold dark matter and our predictions for glast depend on the assumed particle type and its properties
3417109 for typical wimps anywhere from a handful to a few dozen clear signals should stand out from the gamma ray background after two years of observations that would be a big discovery for glast
3417110 it simulates the dark matter distribution from near the time of the big bang until the present epoch so practically the entire age of the universe and focuses on resolving the halo around a galaxy like the milky way
3417111 we see a lot of substructure even in the inner part of the halo where the solar system is
3417112 every substructure has its own sub substructure and so on there are lumps on all scales
3417113 we can make comparisons with the dwarf galaxies and stellar streams associated with the milky way the appearance of these stellar systems is closely linked to the substructure of the dark matter halo

3417133 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions

3417201 unapparente gentilezza non corrisponde sempre alla disponibilit a sottostare alle regole per esempio la bandiera del paese ospitante per quanto pi grande delle altre deve essere pi piccola di quella olimpica non stato facile convincerne i cinesi alla fine siamo arrivati al compromesso asta e bandiera cinese erano pi piccole di solo 30 cm in modo che non fosse percettibile la differenza ma allo stesso tempo che il protocollo fosse salvo
3417202 normalmente la bandiera del paese ospitante viene issata allasta e solo quella olimpica viene portata allinterno dello stadio
3417203 lunica eccezione fu fatta per salt lake city nel 2002 la bandiera che era stata trovata fra le macerie di ground zero pochi mesi prima fu fatta entrare trionfalmente nello stadio alla fine come si visto la bandiera della repubblica popolare stata portata fin sotto al pennone da otto soldati in alta uniforme

3417241 and accounted for 52 of the photo merchandise market value last year by the end of 2008 were going to see this figure reach 57 looking further ahead nearly 30m photobooks will be sold in western europe in 2012
3417242 online is still the channel of choice for most consumers in this market
3417243 accounting for nearly 90 of orders across western europe it makes sense that people are more inclined to create and order photobooks in the comfort of their homes due to the amount of time involved in the creation process and from a retailers perspective theres little appeal in consumers tying up in store kiosks for relatively long periods of time though there are a number of time efficient solutions coming to market calendars and single image gifts require far less creation time and are therefore better suited to the retail environment
3417244 overall the photo merchandise market will be fuelled by falling prices and a growing availability of services at retail which will also drive cannibalisation of the 6 4
3417245 china is a closed society so nbc is essentially opening doors for the other parts of ge
3417246 for those reasons the olympics are working out quite well for ge
3417247 the ratings have been generally higher than what people thought
3417248 there is certainly a core audience for the olympics but there also is a tremendous interest in china
3417249 besides that the economy is lousy gas is too expensive and people are taking fewer vacations that might make them amenable to stay home and watch something where they can root for the athletes
3417250 we expect a profit here but its still too early to tell exactly where it is going to be
3417251 just one of the many benefits of having nbc as part of the ge portfolio
3417252 our results could contribute to the development of targeted therapies and thus improve the treatment of cerebellar tumours in children
3417253 but for that to be possible we first need to understand the principles of how the tumours develop
3417254 if we know how a tumour arises at the molecular level we can also develop specific therapies that actually treat the cause of that particular condition
3417255 normally the signalling pathway ensures a balance of growth and maturation of cells
3417256 but if disrupted it can lead to uncontrolled growth of cells and thus the onset of cancer
3417257 all of our studies have shown that medulloblastomas can only develop from granule cells and their progenitors
3417258 other cells on the other hand such as the large purkinje cells of the cerebellum do not become tumourigenic they dont seem bothered by these mutations at all
3417259 but we also found olig2 in progenitors of the granule cells of the cerebellum and in tumour cells
3417260 that means this protein also influences the formation and multiplication of cancer cells which makes it clear once again just how closely normal and malignant development processes resemble one another we hope our results will contribute to a targeted therapy for medulloblastomas that will require further research however which we already have in the planning
3417261 acquisition of granule neuron precursor identity is a critical determinant of progenitor cell competence to form hedgehog induced medulloblastoma
3417262 medulloblastoma can be initiated in lineage restricted progenitors or stem cells
3417263 the virus is not that clever we can overcome but it works on our ignorance both political ignorance economic ignorance and personal ignorance
3417264 this was proof of principle in patients who had failed the standard therapies and had few if any remaining options
3417265 we had encouraging results including several long term survivors in patients with stage iv cancers that had spread to distant sites
3417266 previous studies determined the maximal radiotherapy doses for single organs
3417267 but this technique has not been tested for simultaneous use on multiple organs so we designed a dose escalation trial to determine the optimal dose starting with fairly low levels and increasing the dose in later groups of patients
3417268 we have seen improved response rates with higher radiation doses without an increase in side effects yet
3417269 and several of them remain disease free one of them three years after treatment
3417270 at the same price terms and conditions as the state purchases for its full time state employees
3417271 the stated intent is to provide an amount sufficient to buy single insurance
3417272 but this is a reach in that traditional plans can be purchased for around 5 500 and higher deductible plans enabling hsa contributions can be purchased for 3 500
3417273 legislators could buy a 2 850 deductible plan for 3 500 take 2 850 and put it in an hsa and pocket the other 650 left from the 7 000 sum
3417274 i guess the upside would be that they are given an incentive to engage in consumer driven health care but id bet most would be too complacent
3417275 it is not really a health care issue as the general assembly members number 113 total with several on other plans anyway
3417276 the baldelli hunt legislation appears to be an end around to increase the buyback stipend amount if nothing else it makes general assembly candidacy a little more appealing to those already covered by the state plans through their employment or their spouse
3417277 i would say that if the representative baldelli hunt was sincere in saving the state money she would simply propose a 50 percent co pay for insurance or eliminate the perk altogether
3417278 her proposal leaves the door open for an increase in the amount of money received with a buyback considering the large number of legislators who are union members it is likely that they are covered by their employer and would opt to take the larger buyback
3417279 if the benefit is eliminated altogether it might save the state something well south of 2 million but the likelihood of that happening is slim at best
3417280 it takes a lot of guts for a state to submit to a cap on federal transfer payments and gov carcieri should be complimented for doing so
3417281 how can bureaucrats in washington dc decide what medicaid services rhode islanders need
3417282 most states prefer to invest in creative ways to raid the federal treasury to fund their out of control medicaid programs rather than taking responsibility for managing a limited budget in the interests of their own citizens
3417283 states need maximum flexibility in managing their medicaid programs and i congratulate the governor for taking advantage of the freedom that president bush has given every state
3417284 what hes looking to do is to give the money to the seniors allowing them the purchasing decisions so rather than going into a group home or nursing home they can elect to stay at home and use that for in home care
3417285 but when it was first introduced we thought it was a great opportunity to give seniors power rather than giving that to the governor rather than setting up a government run system if we can get people to stay in their homes we can save money and provide better support
3417286 if consumers have more information about and control over their health care and community support options they will make more reasoned and cost effective choices about their health especially if their good decision making is rewarded
3417287 the medicaid program must enable consumers to receive individualized health care that is outcome oriented and that is focused on prevention recovery and retaining and maintaining independence
3417288 as the costs of coverage rise so too should the contributions of beneficiaries within certain income limits
3417289 moreover as medicaid coverage was not intended to be a substitute for commercial insurance it is important that beneficiary cost sharing reflect albeit at lower levels other forms of health coverage benefits available to most medicaid enrollees particularly on the children and family side are more comprehensive than most plans in the commercial market

3417308 we have an understanding with cooke aquaculture officials in terms of how the lease is going to be extended so i dont see any issues there at all

3417311 the camp boggy hatchery has been plagued with furunculosis a disease which causes salmon smolt to be weak and unhealthy prior to being placed in grow out sites for about 25 years
3417312 our company has spent a lot of money to try and make salmon smolt at the hatchery healthy but we have not been successful we may be turning the hatchery back to a smolt hatchery for steelhead trout as it used to be furunculosis is not a nig a problem for trout as it is for salmon
3417313 if were going to have a successful salmon aquaculture industry in this province we need a new hatchery facility that has some integrity we dont have such a facility at the present time
3417314 we need to produce good newfoundland salmon smelt as opposed to bringing them in from other areas as other jurisdictions have diseases which are susceptible to the smolt
3417315 i think these people are salmon farmers and their mold is to farm salmon in the ocean from our perspective were more in the mold to be processors and hatchery people because its more in line with the things that we do
3417316 its a mater of us doing what we think were best at and letting other people do what we think theyre best at

3417334 it is a distinct privilege to be the first president of the isf and i look forward to working with the dedicated professionals that have brought the isf to the position it is today i will strive to help raise greater awareness of the information security challenges faced today from the increase in cybercrime to the growing burden of compliance companies need to adopt a risk management perspective and recognize that information security is business driven and not crisis driven
3417335 we are delighted that howard schmidt has accepted this important position at the isf
3417336 the value of the isf has always been born out of the people in the organization its members our expert consultants and the management team it is clear that howards unparalleled experience and knowledge will make a major contribution to the future of the isf and its members he will also be driving our ambitious plans to expand the scale and reach of the isf building on our existing membership from europe and scandinavia through the americas to the middle east india africa australia and the pacific rim

3417353 caregivers have a long exposure to stresses and losses from the dementia and fatigue that comes from caring for their spouses so they experience fewer positive emotions

3417356 this number is an important reminder for physicians and patients that antibiotics can have serious side effects and should only be taken when necessary
3417357 for conditions in which antibiotics have questionable benefit such as many mild upper respiratory tract infections weighing the benefits of antibiotics with the risks of a serious adverse event will be especially important
3417358 because antibiotics are frequently used both appropriately and inappropriately if doctors would reduce the number of antibiotics they prescribe to their patients by even a small percentage we could significantly reduce the number of emergency visits for antibiotic adverse events physicians need to communicate to their patients that antibiotics are not harmless

3417371 the service that we had at the lions club for our 34 community members serving in the canadian armed forces exceeded all expectations
3417372 there were two sub committees setup to work on the high school reunion and the service and they just ran with it it was really well done and everyone was talking about it once it was over
3417373 we had a list of 70 or 80 volunteers when we started and thats not counting the people on our committee people that came home even volunteered the allen and bugler families came in and gave a few hours at the bar nobody had to do anything they just took over
3417374 the hynes family pitched in and maureen ion stepped in and she did all sorts of things people jumped in and helped out the two sub committees high school reunion and tribute service and of course and jeanette taylor took control of the tribute service and they did a smash up job

3417378 you could manage having red head rocks somewhere like the tennis court for a one day event but after breaking rest for five or six nights straight and doing it again its a different story
3417379 everything that i heard was positive and there wasnt anything negative at all i had compliments on how well things were organized how well everything went off and those that havent been home in a while were quite impressed with the town there were people here that hadnt been home in 15 or 20 years and they were really taken back at how the town has progressed
3417380 those that came home were suggesting that high school reunions and come home years should be held every five years people are getting older and you dont know when a particular come home year will be your last the last come home year was 1989 so thats 19 years ago and thats too long we need to have them more often
3417381 als je goede spelers hebt en een groot stadion denk ik dat je op het hoogste niveau van europa moet spelen maar dit is voetbal als we deze twee wedstrijden niet winnen kwalificeren we ons niet en moeten we in de uefa cup spelen

3417385 im telling you when we win the world series ill high five everyone but then you and me are going into the outfield and were going to have a fistfight and no ones going to separate us

3417387 he and i work out at the same place in arizona in the off season and ive seen him call out nfl players during ping pong games asking them when theyre starting jenny craig he told brady quinn who is a monster a physical specimen im going to rip this ball right off your throat hes a piece of work
3417388 theres plenty of room in the car so we dont know why she did it it really looks like poor judgment

3417390 i am appealing to motorists to implement some simple crime reduction measures in order to reduce their chance of becoming the next victim of vehicle crime

3417392 most of the time road rage comes from getting cut off guys taking your parking spot and the first thing you want to do is reach under the seat and now youre going to have problems

3417394 with all i see reportedly going on in washington harrisburg and philadelphia i understand peoples outrage when it comes to public corruption
3417395 the public has lost confidence in many of their elected leaders and in government as a whole we want to do what we can to help restore that confidence in government at the local and county level
3417396 we held two trial matches where akhtar proved his fitness and he is willing to return and since he is determined he is an asset for pakistan
3417397 i am gearing up for the champions trophy after putting the terrible last few months behind me
3417398 his lawyer has argued that akhtar can pay the fine once the appeal against the reduced ban is heard in the court so we have decided to keep the legal matter and cricket separate
3417399 we rested akmal and he too showed improvement in the trial matches so we have included him
3417400 since we would miss yousuf we have included a specialist batsman bazid khan and have also brought in opener khalid latif

3417424 when you look at the big picture we have capital projects going on all over the province during the summer our heaviest maintenance season is from may to november and we have a lot of crews in the field then because the weather is good we do several types of maintenance work on our assets which are our poles our lines and our generators
3417425 we do preventative maintenance corrective maintenance and then we do non maintenance type work over previous inspections we found that the poles in the distribution system between st albans and morrisville are quite old almost 40 years old which is about the lifespan of a service pole through maintenance inspections we found that the poles are basically deteriorating
3417426 our crews will go in and replace about 50 poles on that distribution system and it will cost just over 320 000 its fairly significant because youre basically replacing the lines the contractor will go in and plant the new poles and the hydro crews will go behind them and move the hardware over the conductor the line the insulator etc
3417427 itll take a few months to complete once we get started and thats a common timeline for that type of work its not easy work to do as you can imagine
3417428 its quite extensive and obviously youre not going to get all of them because of how fast the rot is this is a much bigger issue right across the province for us and thats why we have a pretty aggressive maintenance program underway
3417429 a lot of our poles right across our system are aging because the system was built in the 60s as a result of that were doing a lot more replacement and a lot more capital investment
3417430 you dont actually see the damage from the outside you can be driving by and see these poles and not think much about it the poles will often rot from the inside out and ive seen members of crews literally put their fist right through the pole
3417431 we often see ants in the poles as well these ants go on the inside and chew their way out of the pole that makes the lines more vulnerable if you have ice storms high winds or any type of weather that can compromise that pole as well unless were close to the roads our crews will climb the poles most of the time they have spurs on the side of their boots that they use to climb so if they dig their spur in and theres nothing there or the pole collapses thats an obvious safety concern
3417432 dont worry i am going to talk to so and so and we will get this resolved
3417433 those type of kids should be in a school of their own

3417453 the story resurfaced when i was a member of the cabot 500 committee in 1997
3417454 it was noted as having great potential for a play and i was given the task of developing a play from the story
3417455 the project included meetings with the coast of bays corporation and numerous conversations with the town of grand bank which resulted in pages of recommendations as to the pros and cons of developing a play of this nature the project also involved consultations with rising tide theatre contacts with several people and groups such as the superintendent of muns folklore department newfoundland archives the newmans of england and joan horwoods son who compiled a history of harbour breton
3417456 i also drew up a contract between rising tide and the town of harbour breton about the play i also spent considerable time in revising the first draft as i wanted to make sure the dialogue emanated from harbour bretons historical background
3417457 due to the economic crisis that our community found itself facing in 2004 the script was placed on the backburner however with the interest of miranda maddox the towns current economic development officer the play is finally being presented during 2008 because we wanted to tie it in with the come home year activities ms maddox and the cast has done an excellent job with the project which is resulting in excellent performances of the play
3417458 the project has also provided employment for 13 young residents who are all promising actors the play and the cast may be the start of bringing theatre to our community on a more permanent basis overall the play is great entertainment and is an excellent example of an economic development initiative
3417459 the mildred baxter story has nearly all the makings of great theatre there must have been some basis for the story and to me this production is a way of providing history on a personal basis a basis you cant always find by reading a book

3417646 i never got invited you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
3417647 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time
3417648 some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me yes i am a bit upset about it

3417661 i dont think michael will let his guard down until the last relay race
3417662 i dont think he has a comfort zone at all until the whole meet is over the whole olympic games he will not let his guard down because theres always someone out there
3417663 i can copy him but i dont think i could be as good as phelps

3417743 she never behaved like a chief executive and her own staff proved to be her achilles heel what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from any specific decision she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency

3417753 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3417754 unacceptable the new code word for mutually assured self destruction
3417755 before there was a purple revolution in iraq or an orange revolution in ukraine or a cedar revolution in lebanon there was the rose revolution in georgia bush said to the cheering crowd in tbilisi three years ago
3417756 your courage is inspiring democratic reformers and sending a message that echos across the world freedom will be the future of every nation and every people on earth
3417757 first georgian troops should return to their initial position and be partly demilitarised second we need to sign a binding agreement on non use of force
3417758 i repeat now what i said several days ago namely that russia has historically always been the guarantor of the security of the peoples of the caucasus he said
3417759 this is our mission and our duty we have never been just passive observers in this region and never will be
3417760 i have said that our tactic with regard to the georgian leadership which unleashed this aggression is that of enforcing peace in accordance with the united nations charter he said
3417761 we consider this tactic absolutely effective and the only possible option
3417762 soul bush knows so well added this via the pr team
3417763 i dont think russia will feel like talking with mr saakashvili after what he did to our citizens it is not in our tradition to topple anyone or put someone on a throne the bet thing would be for him saakashvili to resign russia has no plans to force anyone from power this is not in our political culture at all
3417764 if we have received the order to ceasefire this does not mean that we have stopped all actions including reconnaissance

3417767 i want to have a president thats not a too smart socially awkward guy i want him to be affable cool and unintimidatingly a bit dull minded exactly like me and my beer buddies cuz it would make me feel vicariously powerful bush
3417768 i want my president to be a poetically ingenious according to dan brown fans world promising cool preacher rocker that oozes happy emotions and sprinkles them into everybodys hearts obama

3417772 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3417773 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code

3417784 rapidly rising health care costs are not simply a federal budget problem

3417786 india has the largest filmmaking industry in the world and i think for all of us we quickly decided we were going to take bollywood 101 and were going to learn the cast of characters there
3417787 there are no casting agents there are no agencies such as we know them so casting is done by relationships and we had to first figure out the lay of the land and finally casting agent judy taylor came and sat in a room in mumbai for a week and literally day and night auditioned people so its just different but we had the most amazing indian crew
3417788 i think the one thing we realized was that there was no like departments everybody just wanted to be helpful in anything they could be helpful in so that was really awesome
3417789 we brought over a lot of our crews from here in the united states
3417790 mona may did our costumes and we had our line producers we worked with an indian production company we liaisoned with them but by and large the bulk of our crew was indian and the last day we were all in tears because they were so dedicated and we just loved them
3417791 after the second movie and they asked us where we thought we would want to go in the world to shoot another movie and we kind of said a couple of names and india was definitely one of them
3417792 definitely its not something i would ever do if it was not a part of this movie but it actually gave me an opportunity to do something that i probably would never do on a normal basis

3417980 you talk to guys on the other team that have to face him and all of them are pretty impressed with the way that hes developed not only with his pitches but his maturity and learning how to pitch hes not a thrower
3417981 its not like i got a whole lot of action either
3417982 that was the important thing thats really what were attempting to do is win series and go from there

3418025 we were coming off a couple of heartbreakers ourselves so i think guys were a little determined to finish this one
3418026 sometimes it puts pressure on me sometimes you get wins with your eyes closed and sometimes there are games like this
3418027 hes growing up out there and maturing and the results are starting to come
3418028 if we sweep them four straight people say were supposed to if you look at their record thats not the case they came in here hot they came in here playing very well and we played very well and beat them four straight
3418029 were playing better right now and were in kind of a nice groove

3418043 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3418044 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3418045 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3418047 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3418048 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3418081 chandni chowk to china is a childrens film i dont think kids will try to attempt to climb the nearest wall to fight after watching the film but i think well have lots of kids joining karate classes
3418082 before i started making this film my interest in the martial arts was restricted to jackie chan jet li bruce lee and the crouching tigers of the world but akshay kumar brought out the hidden dragon in me he made me watch a lot of action scenes before we left for china hed make me sit down every morning and make me watch one kung fu film and explain the subtexts by the time we left to shoot i understood the martial arts much better
3418083 finally we indians have invaded china we were gone for 95 days we shot for 89 days in shanghai and in the interiors of china and lots of action sequences on top of the great wall of china
3418084 but the post production is very complicated the action sequences are like nothing we generally see the story doesnt stop the action builds the plot and characters weve shot it exactly the way we want i dont want to rush the release akshays superstardom isnt going away anywhere

3418116 these changes are designed to reduce the number of unnecessary consultations under the esa so that more time and resources can be devoted to the protection of the most vulnerable species
3418117 the proposed regulations will continue to protect species while focusing the consultation process on those federal actions where potential impacts can be linked to the action and the risks are reasonably certain to occur the result should be a process that is less time consuming and a more effective use of our resources
3418118 draw a direct causal link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts affecting species
3418119 as a result it is inappropriate to consult on a remote agency action involving the contribution of emissions to global warming because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3418120 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3418121 the new rules take decision making on endangered species listings out of the hands of scientists and wildlife professionals at agencies such as the u s fish and wildlife services and instead put those decisions in the hands of agencies working on projects that may be adversely affected by a listing
3418122 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3418123 we are trying to be more efficient which means not do consultations that result in a difference for the species
3418124 when we pursue consultation in situations where the potential effects to a species are either unlikely incapable of being meaningfully evaluated wholly beneficial or pose only a remote risk of causing jeopardy to the species or its habitat
3418125 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3418126 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3418127 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3418128 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3418129 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3418130 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3418131 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act

3418139 madden s the sports gaming superpower though so its hard not to nitpick some of this stuff but even with the listed complaints this is a football game that one ups the stakes between the sidelines and its so visually impressive that its likely to stick in your system all season long even on saturdays
3418140 despite all the this cool stuff madden commits some penalties the game supposedly has more dynamic camera angles but youll often see the same one repeat up to ten times per game as for the computer it often makes strange decisions such as running out the clock when it needs a score or wandering out of bounds for no reason

3418328 theyll sit in their bus or van on their computers and then theyll play and its just like whats the point this is the best thing you could be doing in life
3418329 last time we toured america for three months and being with the same people for three months
3418330 we were getting a lot of coverage from metal hammer at that point but as soon as that happened everything just stopped
3418331 at the same time so many people wanted to come and see us even if it was just to throw a bottle at us
3418332 we never really looked at it as good for press as much as we were thinking everyone thinks weve done this terrible thing
3418333 it was the first time we had our own tour bus and we probably were going a bit wild every night but weve done worse things than take a piss on a bus
3418334 put a bunch of 19 year olds on a bus and things are bound to get a bit crazy
3418335 we recorded our first cd five minutes from the birmingham bullring so if it got a little boring we could just go into town

3418337 we didnt really want to write a cd what sounded anything like our last cd
3418338 its just a waste of time why would you want to do that

3418349 financial issues are getting hit today on worries about the credit market as always
3418350 but the market has come back a bit as oil prices have come down
3418351 until oil prices started coming down a few weeks ago there were twin worries of the economy slowing and inflation accelerating
3418352 now inflation worries are diminishing but we are still struggling with the growth side
3418353 when shall it be that we shall taste the sweetness of the divine will in all that happens to us considering in everything only his good pleasure by whom it is certain that adversity is sent with as much love as prosperity and as much for our good when shall we cast ourselves undeservedly into the arms of our most loving father in heaven leaving to him the care of ourselves and of our affairs and reserving only the desire of pleasing him and of serving him well in all that we can
3418354 we should go to prayer with deep humility and an awareness of our nothingness we must invoke the help of the holy spirit and that of our good angel and then remain still in gods presence full of faith that he is more in us than we are in ourselves

3418370 we feel like weve been led down the garden path and our interest in working in partnership and leading our mission as educators is now being used against us
3418371 theyre pressing for legislative proposals at both the federal and state level that we think are really inappropriate
3418372 that would go against issues of privacy or academic openness that we think are important to maintain
3418373 now hes doing it full time and has an assistant
3418374 our attorneys are also involved on almost a daily basis as am i
3418375 our acting as an agent or providing a direct link between the riaa and students would be circumventing ferpa
3418376 despite their misgivings about the recording industry the university should step out of the picture and stop interfering with the judicial process
3418377 a lot more students are going to have names given out that were not and could not be guilty
3418378 morehead has responded without objection to virtually identical requests in other similar litigation
3418379 indeed hundreds of universities and dozens of commercial internet service providers have responded to the exact same subpoena without breadth or burden concerns
3418380 at the point where universities finally come to see theyre the target of this riaa campaign thats the point at which theyll start arguing their own self interest
3418381 i think that some universities feel like if theyre cooperative then we shouldnt send them so many notices because thats a burden
3418382 but when our vendors detect infringement we send out notices thats not intending to be punitive we really do appreciate and value the cooperation were getting from universities even if it hasnt been uniform across universities
3418383 attempt to get more attention may cause them to receive less attention from us

3418385 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3418386 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people were just like any other people out there we want to be ourselves and not be discriminated against
3418387 i happen to disagree with them in regards to our film its a shame that they are out there and i hope that when it comes out they will actually see the jokes for what they are a deep cutting satire of hollywood and the stars
3418388 everyone has the right to protest its a free country anytime that anyone feels that they are justified in their heart more power to them
3418389 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscar
3418390 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards

3418410 it gives me a mental lift to have got this far because to be honest if they had told me the bleakest medical diagnosis which came out in dribs and drabs in the end i might have said this is not going to happen
3418411 and there were times in the last 12 weeks when i thought how can this be happening has someone put a jinx on me
3418412 but then id go to bed and think no this is the olympics im not going to give up

3418415 but i also think the olympics are something more special anyway it was my dream as a little girl you dont dream about world championships you dream about the olympics

3418426 last years results on the two year fast track programme took us above the national average for the first time at ks3
3418427 this year the cohort of pupils taking ks3 did not contain the same number of high achievers from year 9 and year 8 and therefore we should not be making direct comparisons year on year
3418428 next years results will be more evenly matched and this will give us a clear picture of how successfully this programme has worked nevertheless we are still unhappy there has been a large drop in some subjects in particular english and we will be working closely with our schools providing support and guidance

3418551 the kids insult the cops and pretend to be surprised when they get a reaction
3418552 the police have the unfortunate tendency to lump everyone with brown skin into some street gang when in reality most people here study hard and work hard

3418560 i guess ill ask everybody here does anybody know any other businesses that does work for the county that does it for less than cost or at cost
3418561 but this is not just cut and dried when youre not in the thick of things you dont know the emotional stress we all go through when for instance we get a nice collie that theres absolutely no room for
3418562 if we dont take the dog it will wind up in the country and then wind up with us anyway and then we dont have the advantage of knowing where it came from and whether it has any vaccinations

3418567 i personally just got emotionally tired of all the animals coming in
3418568 i can handle the people its the animals that take the toll on you
3418569 the fee structure is low but even if you were to double or triple it i still would not take the strays back in i dont want to sound negative but i think the focus needs to be on the county doing things more than the pet hospitals stepping up and dealing with all of this

3418584 that is being achieved with a 17 million post tax gain on visa ipo proceeds virtually no growth in 2h08 expenses and no growth in bad debt expense suggests a low quality result
3418585 at the moment st georges total cost of funds is quite similar to the major banks

3418617 my instinct tells me she probably would have done better had senator edwards not been on the ballot in iowa but that wasnt the circumstance
3418618 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his centre fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he obama doesnt his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited

3418656 temporary outage in our contacts system that was preventing gmail from loading properly
3418657 we heard loud and clear today how much people care about their gmail accounts
3418658 we followed all the e mails to our support team and user group we fielded phone calls from google apps customers and friends and we saw the many twitter posts we also heard from plenty of googlers who use gmail for company e mail we never take for granted the commitment weve made to running an e mail service that you can count on
3418659 conducting a full review of what went wrong and moving quickly to update our internal systems and procedures accordingly
3418660 but we wanted to make an exception in this case since so many people were impacted
3418661 their quick response shows their commitment to keep gmail up and running as smoothly as possible which should give users some assurance that google is highly committed to delivering a powerful e mail system that can be used by business users and consumers alike
3418662 this glitch has to be kept in the minds of enterprise users that are looking at gmail use within large companies
3418663 google needs to continue to provide the highest level of customer service and quality of service if they have any hopes of attracting large business customers
3418664 these growing pains which are more evident each day that we rely more on service based software efforts indicate that you cant really trust the cloud at this juncture its too early and providers are learning as they go

3418741 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3418742 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3418743 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3418744 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated

3418752 im so glad to have this race behind me because theres so much pressure
3418753 i tried to keep myself as mentally strong as possible
3418754 last year in melbourne at the world championships one swim started it and then swims just started happening one after another after another we had a great morning this morning and hopefully we can set up some more good swims tonight and keep the ball rolling
3418755 it almost felt like less pressure because it wasnt initially my event
3418756 i dont think its necessarily fair what happened but rules are rules and im just doing what im told
3418757 i just wanted to win my heat and set everything up for tomorrow
3418758 just get through that and prepare myself for tomorrow thats the most important thing an afternoon off and its time to just sort of get as rested as i can recover and i probably have to re shave get all of that stuff down

3418779 last year was last year and i will always want the knights to be successful but theres a right and wrong way of doing things and i think the way things were done last year was not right you cant help but put a lot of their success down to the form of kurt gidley and danny buderus
3418780 the decision to re sign kurt gidley early in the season has been the signing of the season
3418781 since chief executive steve burraston locked him up after round one or two he has improved out of sight

3418803 we were able to come out strong from the beginning as a team and keep the intensity the full 40 minutes
3418804 we played with more energy and confidence now that we know what to expect from the european officials our team defense improved greatly from our first game which was key to our win tonight
3418805 there may be people out there who believe his story but so far i havent met any everyone has questions about when this actually started up and whether she did on the payroll as after and there have been various reports showing a timeline suggesting she went on the payroll after the relationship started about the paternity of the child about the money payments since then and now there are questions of course about whether john edwards himself was a victim to some degree whether he was set up at the beverly hilton perhaps even by her friend
3418806 i do think its one of the central questions here there had been people who have traced out the timelines that suggested that their relationship did indeed start before he put her on the payroll that he paid her out of his pack money that this was money he had taken from others for various political purposes and for his campaign against poverty and therefore he betrayed the donors but i must say that there is a much larger sense of betrayal here that hangs over this and that is having run had he won the nomination of the party all sorts of people are now asking the question we talked about friday and that is what if this had blown up at any time along the way would somebody else have been nominated and if it had blown up very late would he have cost his party if he had been the nominee of the party would he have cost his party a chance to take this one
3418807 well other than the question of barack obamas vice presidential candidate its about the only story the press has to deal with over the next two weeks so i think its interesting how the press is coming back to the hillary clinton story as you know i continue to believe that hillary clinton ought to be on the short list and be very seriously considered for the vice presidential spot
3418808 personally im in chicago and my impression on the obama campaign is that she is not and i think theyre scrambling to make sure that she is honored at the convention i do think chelsea is likely to introduce her now and there will be a magic moment and that will be a chance to have quote a catharsis that she thinks is necessary at the convention it will be a big big rally for her at that moment and then her husband will have a chance to speak so theyre going to get plenty of major major airtime but the reports from the field are and i run into this all the time now there are an awful lot of people out there who are hillary supporters especially older women who are not yet reconciled to the obama candidacy who are resisting it in a variety of ways and i think they still have a job to do on both sides the clinton side as well as the obama side to bring this together and the convention is going to be critical

3418829 se aplica en la mayor a de los convenios colectivos del sector privado
3418830 el personal del sector p blico se encuentra discriminado respeto al del sector privado
3418831 el sueldo de los funcionarios aumentar m s del 3 por ciento en 2009 algo que es claramente enga oso y no se ajusta al aumento real de la n mina mensual de cada uno de los 2 6 millones de funcionarios que trabajan en las diferentes administraciones p blicas
3418832 se desglosa en el aumento anual del 2 por ciento varios aumentos que se pagan en concepto de productividad a determinados colectivos las aportaciones al plan de pensiones privado que se impuso desde algunos sindicatos y el map y la suma de una parte del complemento espec fico a las pagas extraordinarias un 0 7 por ciento
3418833 por lo tanto cuando el ministerio de econom a y hacienda habla de aumentos superiores al 3 por ciento no dice toda la verdad puesto que como aumento de la n mina tan s lo puede considerar un 2 7 por ciento y algunas mejoras salariales pactadas por los sindicatos en las diferentes administraciones auton micas o locales
3418834 la p rdida de poder adquisitivo para el personal de sector p blico ha sido contin a en los ltimos a os
3418835 mientras exist a crecimiento econ mico el aumento de los salarios de los 2 6 millones de personas estaba por debajo del ipc y perdiendo poder adquisitivo y ahora que se ha entrado en una situaci n de crisis econ mica no es aceptable que lo vuelva a pagar el personal del sector p blico

3418840 la reducci n de la precariedad en las diferentes administraciones la defensa del sistema p blicos de pensiones y su oposici n a la extensi n de los planes de pensiones privados y el freno a las privatizaciones en el sector p blico

3418849 this is an act that he committed himself he chose to drink and he chose to drive
3418850 i think that our society has tended to discount the seriousness of impaired driving and we do that everyday and in every way we keep on making excuses for alcohol and that takes a devastating toll in our society
3418851 there are so many obstacles to effective enforcement that a significant segment of police are reluctant to lay charges
3418852 cases get dropped the individuals raise questionable defences its a very frustrating business
3418853 there are a lot of drivers who we get one time only and theyve learned their lesson from that but again theres a certain amount of the population that will just continue to drink and drive doesnt matter how many convictions they have
3418854 we will have to work through this as the year progresses

3418870 these companies were able to focus they took time to develop and they provided multiple revenue streams
3418871 with our intellectual and relationship capital we should be on top and were not
3418872 what i always felt was the core of the success of the industry standard was it was editorially driven which is why i was the number two person in the company
3418873 it helped solidify the brand identity it didnt drive that much traffic but helped us with advertisers who werent too sold on us in the beginning
3418874 the cost to produce it can almost be justified on that basis
3418875 at the industry standard we spent more than 1 million building the web site at new west we spent 15 000
3418876 for b to b they jointly drive both ad revenue and the many ancillary revenue sources that have enabled this sector to maintain growth against the odds for the b to c world the roles have varied depending on the specific markets dynamics
3418877 the rates are much higher in baltimore than other areas of the state
3418878 there are a lot of lives to be saved by reducing cardiovascular disease you can connect the dots from high salt intake to excessive death rates in cardiovascular disease
3418879 we got criticized years ago for encouraging people not to smoke and many people argued it was a choice

3418932 in todays turbulent business climate the ability to manage and achieve significant organisational goals has become a core skill for senior managers such success is normally driven through effective project management from planning to execution but with the business landscape of the 21st century undergoing unpredictable and rapid change the classic approach to project management is no longer adequate
3418933 this traditional approach which emphasises achieving goals on time and within budget is quite simply not applicable the definition of project success is now evolving to encompass goals such as value creation and real benefits realisation rather than just adherence to timelines and costs
3418934 tools and processes of course remain important but the emphasis has shifted and project management is fast evolving into a discipline that can bring real valuable benefits to organisations operating in the ever changing and unpredictable business world of today

3418971 if we find an easy agreement maybe we can finish our discussions but it may take another meeting after that to get together
3418972 we are relying on the understanding of other partners in this effort were asking people to look closely and quickly in the nsg to move expeditiously and we hope that will happen and then well go to the us congress
3418973 were trying to listen to other governments and well have a more complete discussion later this month with the other nuclear suppliers
3418974 now that india has told us theyre ready to move forward were determined to move as far as we can as quickly as we can
3418975 we also talked a lot about india we talked about the india civil nuclear initiative that the united states has taken and how were working with other governments now first at the iaea in vienna where we were able to achieve consensus to move forward on the safeguards agreement
3418976 and now were working and talking to other countries in the nsg
3418977 and so as we approach a group meeting in the nsg weve tried to make sure that we listened to key countries that we talked to key countries and japan is certainly one of them
3418978 a lot of very different discussions both on the non proliferation aspects of the agreement and the cooperation with india where i think it is important to bring in india alongside the international non proliferation effort
3418979 about the bigger picture of our relationships with india and how those are improving and changing and how this agreement fits in that context as well
3418980 we think those are important things to be discussed but we also think that those issues and questions that can be raised do indeed have good answers solid answers because in the end this agreement contributes to non proliferation
3418981 it contributes to clean energy for indias economic development and it contributes to indias relationship with the rest of the world
3418982 so we think its a good thing we hope people will talk this through nuclear suppliers and reach consensus

3419005 our conclusions may or may not be different for women in other socioeconomic status ses groups hence more research needs to be conducted among latinas from differing ses groups including research focusing on the role of social support and cultural values beliefs related to childbirth and pregnancy among latinas
3419006 the higher prevalence rate of depression in americanized latina women is of concern in our community as the population demographics clearly indicate a significant rate of growth of this group in their childbearing years

3419105 if you dont reach the goals you are put on probation and terminated so it seemed like the best way that we could do is give the program up and give it to another donor center
3419106 i think its sad that we have to give it up but the national requirements are so strict we cant continue with the program
3419107 weve been approached by st lukes to begin managing their file and take over the region
3419108 but the national marrow donor program makes the final decision
3419109 the whole reason for the recruitment goals is to try to meet the needs of patients who currently dont have the same access
3419110 he was guilty and i dont know what else he could have pleaded
3419111 hes an individual who should never walk among us again
3419112 clearly hes been unwilling to accept the help hes needed
3419113 its still early in the games we just finished day four in 16 days of competition said coc spokesperson steve keogh in a telephone interview from beijing
3419114 when you look at the schedule some of the sports that we traditionally do well in take place later on
3419115 no one places more pressure on these athletes than themselves
3419116 they have pressure to get here and have pressure to get through the games
3419117 has canada ever done well during the summer olympics theyre a winter powerhouse though
3419118 well i am happy with how i did i swam ran did well and i am happy to compete with these guys
3419119 american made motorcycles like harleys dont matter to john mccain
3419120 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3419121 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself
3419122 wont a single tape of wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
3419123 no one was out of their houses no one was sitting on their front lawns
3419124 the numbers of casualties we could have had would be tremendous
3419125 could europe be involved in a peacekeeping mission europe is available to do that of course
3419126 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3419127 the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3419128 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3419129 president saakashvili is the duly elected president of a sovereign democratic nation and so the determination of him as president is his decision and a decision for the georgian people and not for any outside nation to make
3419130 neither the u s nor any other foreign country is physically in place
3419131 he was sent to amman in the afternoon after experiencing heart problems
3419132 this was an incredibly irresponsible act in which the motorcyclist put his own life and the lives of other road users in extreme danger
3419133 it also shows blatant disregard for the laws which apply to all road users wiltshire police will not tolerate anyone who seeks to flagrantly disobey the laws of the road and will deal robustly with anyone who does so
3419134 the court has shown that this behaviour is unacceptable and that those who drive in such a manner will have to face the consequences of their actions
3419135 i am pleased the court has dealt with this person so robustly
3419136 excess speed is one of the main causes of collisions and this sends a strong message that the criminal justice system and our community safety partners will not tolerate this type of behaviour
3419137 he saw this picture and obviously for him it was very easy to recognize the girl accompanied by a woman in a veil
3419138 its her nanny she is a young moroccan woman who is qualified to look after children and works in a care center
3419139 i am very pleased that this little girl has been identified and that she can be ruled out from her familys perspective clearly for kate and gerry it is a disappointment but we have had many of these before and the search for madeleine will continue
3419140 our argument is unless you give tamils a feeling they have the right to their own destiny in many matters you will not succeed the lttes capacity to carry out terrorist attacks is not diminished
3419141 the sri lankan army has made a lot of progress in the last few weeks
3419142 but even if they win the battle i am not sure they will win the war
3419143 i think they havent got the tamil population on their side i know the sri lankan government will be unhappy at this advice but that is the best advice they could get
3419144 the borders should be according to the 1967 borders thats in the road map and the annapolis understandings a palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital what we heard today is not new and is unacceptable and shows again that israel is not serious concerning the peace process this is an attempt to escape from a just peace
3419145 we hope the israeli side will stick to the agreement to continue negotiations away from the media and not to begin engagement in the blame game

3419149 shes been here for one week and hasnt seen a doctor even though they know she has been shot

3419151 erin was a big tough mountain of a man who enjoyed the outdoors
3419152 he was a true warrior and just the person you would want beside you in a firefight
3419153 what they tend to do is fire a few harassing rounds and then theyll disappear into the woodwork
3419154 the combat outpost was engaged in a classic shoot and scoot fashion and unfortunately master cpl doyle was killed by a direct hit on the outpost
3419155 we killed a number and wounded a number the precise numbers of which we dont track because were not in the business of body counts
3419156 theyre in combat outposts because these are difficult areas where the insurgents have a reasonable grip
3419157 the only other option is you leave the population completely uncovered and you leave them completely at the mercy of the taliban and thats not what were here to do were here to bring security to the people so its tough theres no question its tough and every time we have a loss like this it has a big effect
3419158 was quite intimidating to look at him but he had a good sense of humour
3419159 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3419160 the large whales the commercially important ones have for the most part responded well under protection
3419161 we have all the books why dont you just read them instead of asking me
3419162 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
3419163 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
3419164 the dup was relentlessly trying to interfere in the uup tory talks and would not be ditching its support and links with the order
3419165 party policy for the rest of the uk has to reflect different situations in other regions unlike northern ireland most parts of gb do not have a selection based post primary system therefore party policy has to reflect different local circumstances
3419166 enceladus has got warmth water and organic chemicals some of the essential building blocks needed for life
3419167 we have quite a recipe for life on our hands but we have yet to find the final ingredient liquid water but enceladus is only whetting our appetites for more
3419168 unfortunately from a republican perspective there are two different jurisdictions and two different economies and two different realities on the island
3419169 the major question historians will ask is not why the republicans surrendered but why they fought such a futile long war
3419170 it has not been unconditional surrender and it has been infinitely better than continuing to fight a futile war for the sake of honouring irelands dead yet producing only more of them but let us not labour under any illusions that the conditions were good
3419171 party leader david ford claimed today that the dup and sinn fein do not want the minister to be a member of the executive meaning he or she would have no role in wider issues like the budget
3419172 so called breakthrough over the department of justice amounts to very little
3419173 apparently all the dup and sinn fein have proposed is a minister who would not even be a member of the executive
3419174 how could anyone fulfil a role as important as justice minister in those circumstances
3419175 should be a runaway winner an eye for detail humour and history i want to be him
3419176 depth variety and regular posts and a bit of politics too
3419177 a brilliant mix of humour politics and insightful analysis not just of ni but of british left politics and beyond where else do you get postings in what i assume is serbo croat beside gail walker watch and the photos attaching to the stories are usually hilarious although a disappointing absence of girls aloud as naughty schoolgirls of late
3419178 for its unusual socialist outlook on northern ireland and wider politics his is the perspective of someone who feels not unreasonably that the present party political system leaves his left wing views unrepresented as such he stands aside from the traditional ni partisan discussions a refreshing interesting and nicely written blog
3419179 is written with a certain amount of linquistic flair this is a blogger who clearly enjoys his english he also enjoys reading and gives us book reviews and cultural pieces his political position is self described as liberal unionist but his views are not entirely predictable and the items rather eclectic including a fascination with and dislike for ethnic nationalism in its east european manifestations
3419180 chekov really has a penchant for writing in a way that really grasps the reader
3419181 i hate to say it but chekov does write well
3419182 passionate unionism epitomising the pan uk unionist approach oneill synthesises an incredible amount of material for this blog a blogger with a genuine grasp of his subject
3419183 for the fact that he is in public office and combines council business and interesting outlooks generally
3419184 but only since pol omuiri came on board since then it has moved beyond a party political platform to something more considered and interesting
3419185 a group blog fairly closely associated with an identifiable political party is quite a good thing as it provides a picture of that partys id as well as a space for them to develop their thinking about issues that they will sometimes have to answer for their stance on soonish
3419186 a wee part of the blogosphere where i can be found and i shamelessly do so because it will permit me to state that the blog in question has been nominated four times in political blog categories and lost four times
3419187 i agree with its tone and attitude regarding the north of ireland situation
3419188 ignited has a grasp of the nuts and bolts of politics which i envy reading his pieces always make me view my own stuff as a bit conceptual and airy fairy a blog which is in touch with the unionist grass roots
3419189 fair deal is one of the very few bloggers delivering a dup standpoint in a thoughtful manner i rarely agree with what he says but hes always worth reading damian oloan is an excellent new addition writing coherent and temperate analysis from a liberal nationalist perspective an encouraging indication that moderation is not dead
3419190 fair deal damian oloan tom griffin patrick corrigan and very occasionally ian parsley all are delivering thoughtful and coherent articles analysing different areas of political life here
3419191 almost intimidating erudition from brian crowe as he examines the world from communitarian conservative perspective
3419192 where language literature and politics intersect some thoughtful musings on identity in relation to northern ireland from an irish ex pat
3419193 a tyrone ex pats whimsical blog where politics is viewed through the filters of sport travel identity and more recently fiction
3419194 a new collaborative venture by a number of bloggers braodly on the left it deals in political social and cultural issues as well as some humour
3419195 possibly the most impressive blog there are serious and thoughtful pieces virtually every day on a huge range of topics
3419196 serving up an interesting mix of investigative journalism and local interest
3419197 david vance really out posts the other contributors and hes from the north though id say that his focus is a good deal wider but his stuff on ni is quite astute

3419216 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3419217 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3419218 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3419219 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3419220 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3419221 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3419222 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one

3419247 we want to have a nice quiet low key day
3419248 maybe go for a walk in the country visit some friends
3419249 we wanted to make sure everyone that we were close to all the people whove supported us could be there
3419250 so we could say we did it we made it to a year and all of you helped us out

3419259 its a dream coming true and the feeling is so wonderful
3419260 in particular i want to share the honor of this gold with the people of my home province sichuan
3419261 it was their solidarity and unyielding spirit in the face of crisis that inspired me to perform well in todays competition
3419262 it can be called a miracle in the human history of combating major natural disasters
3419263 and we wouldnt have accomplished this without the assistance from the whole country and the whole world
3419264 you have chosen as the theme of these games one world one dream that is what we are tonight
3419265 as one world we grieved with you over the tragic earthquake in sichuan province
3419266 heighten the morale of the chinese nation in the reconstruction of quake stricken areas
3419267 it was a great game our lads fought bravely and were just unlucky
3419268 i was very frustrated when the tremor destroyed everything in seconds the house and all the assets i earned through working in the cities
3419269 but seeing the great performance of the chinese athletes at the olympic games is really encouraging
3419270 just like yao and his team they are weaker than the americans and the spaniards but their spirit can really boost the morale of people here who were also unlucky to be stricken by the earthquake

3419273 im pleased with the time but there technical parts of my race that didnt go as planned
3419274 trying to breathe air and instead getting a mouthful of water kind of puts a damper on a race where youre trying to go as fast as you can
3419275 but the fact that happened and i still went 47 84 its only the second time ive gone under 48 seconds so im pleased
3419276 we just need a lane in wednesdays final we all did the job we had to do tonight
3419277 were all trying to get on this relay this morning vying for positions and trying to show what weve got
3419278 so we werent going easy to get into that final but still we didnt swim our two best swimmers so weve got a lot more room there
3419279 most of us are senior athletes weve all been there and done that
3419280 i think the last 50 metres could have been a little better
3419281 i started to feel it with 60 metres to go so that last 50 was a little bit painful but its a personal best and a canadian record by 1 2 and its under the 2 10 barrier which has been a huge barrier to break in terms of breaststroke
3419282 theres less than 10 guys in the world in the history of swimming who have done that and im in that handful so its pretty cool to be able to do say ive done that
3419283 on my cell phone when you put on the display you can write something on it and i just had 2 09 no problem
3419284 ive had that for four years now so since 2004 ive finally been able to say that now
3419285 i felt really good up until about the 140 metre mark so if i can make that last 50 a bit better kind of tweak things here and there like into the 100 metre wall i kind of glided a bit too much theres little things that add up that you can work on that you can fix
3419286 anything can happen and if you get to that final its anybodys game
3419287 there were just a few details i have to take care of like tighter turns and a better finish at the wall also

3419291 the mechanism of wishing must be if i can wish that which will never happen
3419292 of what a queer nature the protoplasm must be to act in such a way
3419293 the mechanism of the mind must be of a most peculiar kind to be able to do what the mind does
3419294 we think with a pencil on a piece of paper
3419295 the thought is not the same as the sentence for an english and a french sentence which are utterly different can express the same thought
3419296 in my visual field i see the image of the tree to the right of the image of tower
3419297 i see the image of the tree in the middle of the visual field
3419298 i can assure you i feel the visual image to be two inches behind the bridge of my nose
3419299 do you know all the feelings there are how do you know there isnt such a feeling
3419300 you can estimate a length when you see it why shouldnt i have a different way of estimating it
3419301 i feel in my hand that the water is three feet under the ground
3419302 surely you know what it means you know what three feet under the ground means and you know what i feel means
3419303 the measurement has shown that the water runs three feet under the ground
3419304 if we dig three feet deep we are going to strike water
3419305 the depth of the water is three feet by the eye
3419306 a feeling in my hands of water being three feet under the ground
3419307 how did you learn the meaning of the word three feet
3419308 i have never learnt to correlate depth of water under the ground with feelings in my hand but when i have a certain feeling of tension in my hands the words three feet spring up in my mind
3419309 this is a perfectly good explanation of what you mean by feeling the depth to be three feet and the statement that you feel this will have neither more nor less meaning than your explanation has given it
3419310 i feel the depth of the water to be n feet
3419311 i feel or i believe that p is the case
3419312 it has four storeys i suppose each storey is about fifteen feet height so it must be about sixty feet
3419313 i roughly know what a yard at that distance looks like so it must be about four yards long
3419314 i can imagine a tall man reaching to about this point so it must be about six feet above the ground
3419315 what happened in this case when the man estimated the length
3419316 he looked at the thing and said it looks one yard long
3419317 possibly just this he heard my words and took a yellow ball from the bag
3419318 why in carrying out my order did you paint this colour
3419319 this colour pointing to the sample which i have given him was called red and the patch i had painted has as you see the colour of the sample
3419320 why did you carry out my order by painting just this colour
3419321 wherever you are you must have got there from somewhere else and to that previous place from another place and so on
3419322 if you had said this you would have stressed the infinite
3419323 why did you paint just this colour when i told you to paint a red patch
3419324 i have been shown a sample of this colour and the word red was pronounced to me at the same time and therefore this colour now always comes to my mind when i hear the word red
3419325 we can only conjecture the cause but we know the motive
3419326 surely the real place of thought is in our head
3419327 did you mean to say that all our past experience has shown that a machine never had toothache
3419328 certainly not but you can build up more complicated cases if you like
3419329 i wished for an apple but a pear has satisfied me
3419330 i feel a longing though i dont know what im longing for
3419331 i feel a fear but i dont know what im afraid of
3419332 i feel fear but im not afraid of anything in particular
3419333 i am afraid of something but i dont know of what
3419334 there isnt except that we are then using the word to know in a queer way
3419335 now i know what i was afraid of i was afraid of so and so happening
3419336 what in this case is the process of getting to know like
3419337 what do we call getting to know or finding out
3419338 surely its quite simple there are other things which you dont know of and there can also be toothache which you dont know of it is just a new discovery
3419339 lets see how the word unconscious to know etc etc is used in this case and how its used in others
3419340 what is it like in this case to ge to know
3419341 i see a has toothache hes got a red patch on his cheek
3419342 how do you know a has toothache when you see a red patch
3419343 how do you know that he has got toothache when he holds his cheek
3419344 i say he has toothache when he holds his cheek because i hold my cheek when i have toothache
3419345 and why do you suppose that toothache corresponds to his holding his cheek just because your toothache corresponds to your holding your cheek
3419346 how do you know that so and so is the case
3419347 i have found the bacillus so and so in his blood
3419348 a man has angina if this bacillus is found in him
3419349 a man has angina whenever he has an inflamed throat
3419350 what should we gain by a definition as it can only lead us to other undefined terms
3419351 there is no one exact usage of the word knowledge but we can make up several such usages which will more or less agree with the ways the word is actually used
3419352 it makes in this case no sense of talk of a doubt
3419353 how can one think what is not the case if i think that kings college is on fire when it is not on fire the fact of its being on fire does not exist then how can i think it how can we hang a thief who doesnt exist
3419354 i cant hang him when he doesnt exist but i can look for him when he doesnt exist
3419355 if we do we imagine non existent combinations of existing elements
3419356 but cant we imagine an object utterly different from any one which exists
3419357 no the elements individuals must exist if redness roundness and sweetness did not exist we could not imagine them
3419358 but surely red objects must have existed and you must have seen them if you are able to imagine them
3419359 exerting a pressure on your eye ball produces a red image
3419360 as the fact which would make our thought true if it existed does not always exist it is not the fact which we think
3419361 i believe the fact that the college is on fire
3419362 it isnt the sugar cane which we eat but the sugar
3419363 it isnt mr smith who hangs in the gallery but his picture
3419364 how can something be the shadow of a fact which doesnt exist
3419365 how can we know what the shadow is a shadow of
3419366 what makes a portrait the portrait of so and so
3419367 intending this to be a portrait of so and so
3419368 that a picture is a portrait of a particular object consists in its being derived from that object in a particular way
3419369 meaning and saying it is essential that we should imagine the processes of saying and meaning to take place in two different spheres
3419370 every sign is capable of interpretation but the meaning mustnt be capable of inter pretation it is the last interpretation
3419371 how can we expect something that is not the case
3419372 how can we expect a fact which does not exist
3419373 surely two sentences of different languages can have the same sense
3419374 therefore the sense is not the same as the sentence
3419375 i cant show him to you now as he isnt there all 1 can show you is a picture of him
3419376 isnt it queer that in europe we should be able to mean someone who is in america
3419377 did you mean the man who won the battle of austerlitz
3419378 theres no doubt i imagine kings college and no other building
3419379 these beads must all have been together in the box before
3419380 i meant the man who won the battle of austerlitz
3419381 how long does it take to know how to go on
3419382 how is this possible was there a crash louder than that of a gun in your imagination
3419383 then you didnt really expect a louder crash but perhaps the shadow of one and how did you know that it was the shadow of a louder crash
3419384 but the expression of our thoughts can always lie for we may say one thing and mean another
3419385 but meaning thinking etc are private experiences they are not activities like writing speaking etc
3419386 i know that i see hear feel pains etc but not that anyone else does i cant know this because i am i and they are they
3419387 if you pity someone for having pains surely you must at least believe that he has pains
3419388 what colour could it be as it obviously has none of the colours known to us
3419389 i can only know that i have personal experiences not that anyone else has
3419390 how can we believe that the other has pain what does it mean to believe this how can the expression of such a supposition make sense
3419391 we cant have havent as a rule pains in another persons tooth
3419392 you point to this spot because you know before you point that the pains are there
3419393 what does it mean to know that the pains are there
3419394 i can point to the spot you mean because i see it
3419395 i can direct you to the place because i know where it is first turning to the right etc
3419396 i must know where a thing is before i can point to it
3419397 i must know where a thing is before i can look at it
3419398 one can only obey an order after having understood it
3419399 a sensation travels from my tactual cheek to my tactual eye
3419400 i may have toothache in another mans tooth but not his toothache
3419401 surely there is quite a definite act of imagining the other person to have pain
3419402 i grant you that you cant know when a has pain you can only conjecture it
3419403 you cant count through the whole series of cardinal numbers
3419404 it is impossible for a human being to swim across the atlantic
3419405 we feel pain in the same place in the same body our descriptions tally but still my pain cant be his
3419406 because my pain is my pain and his pain is his pain
3419407 they cant have the same colour because after all this book has its own colour and the other book has its own colour too
3419408 this is the same chair that i saw an hour ago
3419409 this is not the same chair but one exactly like the other
3419410 a and b couldnt have seen the same chair for a was in london and b in cambridge they saw two chairs exactly alike
3419411 the colours green and blue cant be in the same place simultaneously
3419412 three men cant sit side by side on a bench a yard long
3419413 6 foot is 6 inches longer than 5 foot 6
3419414 if what i feel is always my pain only what can the supposition mean that someone else has pain
3419415 this tree vanishes when we turn our backs to it
3419416 isnt it absurd to make this a county to draw the boundaries here
3419417 what you want is only a new notation and by a new notation no facts of geography are changed
3419418 we dont wish to use the phrase unconscious thoughts we wish to reserve the word thought for what you call conscious thoughts
3419419 there can only be conscious thoughts and no unconscious ones
3419420 i do two things with this hammer i drive a nail into this board and one into that board
3419421 i am doing only one thing with this hammer i am driving a nail into this board and one into that board
3419422 why do you tell us this if you dont believe that we really hear it
3419423 we never know what the other man really sees when he looks at a thing
3419424 we can never know whether he calls the same thing blue which we call blue
3419425 i can never know what he sees or that he sees at all for all i have is signs of various sorts which he gives me therefore it is an unnecessary hypothesis altogether to say that he sees what seeing is i only know from seeing myself i have only learnt the word seeing to mean what i do
3419426 how can we wish that this paper were red if it isnt red doesnt this mean that i wish that which doesnt exist at all therefore my wish can only contain something
3419427 i cant know what he sees when he truthfully says that he sees a blue patch
3419428 when anything is seen really seen it is always i who see it
3419429 this is the same person whom i saw an hour ago
3419430 when anything is seen it is always i who see
3419431 of which i said it continued during all the experiences of seeing was not any particular entity
3419432 a railway train a railway station and a railway car are different kinds of objects
3419433 a railway train a railway accident and a railway law are different kinds of objects
3419434 it is always i who see when anything is seen
3419435 whenever anything is seen it is this which is seen
3419436 i am pointing at the visual field as such not at anything in it
3419437 only what i see or see now is really seen
3419438 although by the word i i dont mean l w it will do if the others understand i to mean l w if just now i am in fact l w
3419439 and that this meant something to him i should say
3419440 as long as it doesnt alter the use of the piece it hasnt what i call a meaning
3419441 but surely the word i in i have pain serves to distinguish me from other people because it is by the sign i that i distinguish saying that i have pain from saying that one of the others has
3419442 this is the direction in which i see my image in the mirror
3419443 the appearance or sense datum of my finger points to the sense datum of the tree
3419444 this description only was derived from reality only this was compared with reality
3419445 i never know what the other really means by brown or what he really sees when he truthfully says that he sees a brown object
3419446 this chart shows me that i must use the word brown for the description of this patch
3419447 how can the body have pain the body in itself is something dead a body isnt conscious
3419448 but wouldnt this form of expression at least be an indirect one
3419449 but taking proper care of it is my highest priority and im encouraged by dr weilands experience with this type of injury and his outlook towards my recovery and rehabilitation
3419450 the three british soldiers were evacuated to a military hospital where one of them sadly died from his wounds
3419451 cpw has a genuinely exciting proposition with talkmobile as well as fantastic brand pedigree and were delighted to have been chosen as their first preferred supplier

3419453 what i ask of my people is to keep peace in their hearts i do allow trials to come over them this is to keep them humble do not wait but try to get closer to god for hard days are at hand when a powerful darkness will set over this country wickedness and sin have reached their end and the almighty and righteous one will take revenge on the sin be holy and draw near the lord with your life and a clean heart with fasting and praying so i can spare you in the days of trouble the day of the holy ones terrible wrath is getting close and everyone will receive their just reward for god is a righteous judge do not be lazy but come before me on your knees more often

3419463 the concept of operation immortality is much more than a theme to an online game the earths population needs to quickly adjust our behavior regarding global warming or else fiction quickly becomes our new reality when we learned that richard garriott will be conducting environmental research while in space the stars all aligned to support him
3419464 planet make over is about saving the planet the message is serious but the process
3419465 i know first hand the power that music has to unite people and i know that global warming poses a serious and pending threat to humanity
3419466 the first step is to come together and collectively change our daily habits or operation
3419467 i am very excited to have rock greats such as johnson pike and bruton bringing their message to save the earth from environmental catastrophe
3419468 my current gaming project tabula rasa starts with the earth being devastated by hostile aliens however regardless of how humanity faces its doom planet make over and operation immortality are working for the same result humanitys survival

3419483 we have a number of serious concerns about the quality of care being delivered these have been raised both during our own inspections and as a result of complaints we have investigated
3419484 we are currently working extremely closely with the care home management with southern cross and with east lothian council to ensure improvements are made immediately
3419485 ive come on at night and found i was the only nurse on duty i was working with two young care assistants who had very little experience
3419486 following an inspection by the care commission ten days ago we were informed that seven requirements highlighted during a previous inspection have now been met and three partially met
3419487 we will continue working closely with the care commission and east lothian council to ensure the delivery of a quality service to all our residents

3419506 i agree with italy we cannot form an anti russian front it would be very wrong to isolate russia
3419507 i fear that the russians are not really open to mediation the russian prime minister vladimir putin says this is a russian affair that mediation is not necessary
3419508 it has become increasingly clear that the russians will not accept georgia and the ukraine becoming members of nato the north atlantic treaty organisation
3419509 none of the ministers are able to leave the capital right now

3419515 everyone is entitled to their opinion but we just need to stay concentrated on what were trying to achieve
3419516 if we sign better players then i expect to evolve to the next level
3419517 at the end of it all it comes down the players they have their own reasons their own responsibilities and their own outlook on life its not for me to tell them what to do and what not to do
3419518 lots of players have big egos and others may not be willing to put their necks on the line
3419519 at this point its water under the bridge theres no reason to dwell on it
3419520 im thankful that things worked out where i was able to stay and be the starting quarterback here when its all said and done thats what really matters to me
3419521 its getting better unfortunately its a slower process than i would hope it would be but im making strides in the right direction
3419522 we cant continue to perform this way late in the game
3419523 we have to make some adjustments i have to figure out what i have and who is willing to step up in those roles
3419524 today was a big win for us a big win
3419525 we have to refocus and not allow this to cross over into this road trip
3419526 i didnt want to let the team down like i did previously
3419527 i got in there worked the count and got the pitch that i was waiting for
3419528 you just keep going out there and keep battling its all you can do
3419529 it was real big for these guys to really pull together and come back
3419530 especially 5 1 down and didnt look like anything was going our way at all
3419531 test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function
3419532 we wanted to do more solid work with greater continuity persistence impact and reach
3419533 we gradually discovered how much art and culture have in common organised groups did research on medicinal plants and community vegetable gardens and from that work radio programmes were created which are broadcast by the community stations

3419535 exxon johns out of touch agenda may be a boon for big oil but its a bust for americas working families
3419536 exxon mccain 08 is the perfect ticket for big oil because only mccain looks at record profits and promises 4 billion more the choice in this election is perfectly clear if you want four more years of flawed energy policies dominated by gimmicks and giveaways for big oil vote for exxon john in november
3419537 the unemployment rate spiked again in july to 5 7 percent its highest level in more than four years and a strong signal that come election day millions of americans will still be hunting for work the nations employers cut their payrolls for the seventh consecutive month this time by 51 000 jobs the government reported friday for millions still at work hours were reduced a hidden form of unemployment and the average raise was less than enough to keep up with inflation
3419538 when president bush took office nearly 13 percent of american jobs were in manufacturing in november that figure fell below 10 percent for the first time ever and at last measure was 9 95 percent
3419539 economic plans really are an extension of the bush administration policies
3419540 mccain doesnt like to hear it but his economic plans really are an extension of bush administration policies when all the economic mumbo jumbo is removed that fact remains
3419541 you could make an argument that theres been great progress economically
3419542 john mccain http search politico com results cfm subject john mccain went on the offensive thursday in a key battleground state hoping to blunt criticism that he was indirectly responsible for the possible loss of more than 8 000 jobs in wilmington ohio http search politico com results cfm subject ohio

3419566 donna loved designing and wanted a career in fashion itll be fun to explore that storyline and im sure fans will be dying to know if shes still married to david its going to be so fun to work with jennie garth again and see where donna is today when they say you cant go home again its not true im headed back to the zip code i know best and couldnt be happier
3419567 they want a place that is big enough for at least three kids
3419568 i can say this now but i thought it was hilarious that we hadnt thrown a touchdown pass in a passing league i finally dont have to answer that question anymore we played like we were fighting for something thats the way we have to play
3419569 all the talk about the secondary being washed up people seem to forget theres a bunch of all stars back there and that defence is a great defence theres nothing wrong nobodys lost a step were the same team were just trying to get our attitudes together at the end of the day we got the w we made more plays than they did
3419570 we made plays when we had to when we won the grey cup a couple of years ago we made plays late in the game when we had to there havent been many blowouts in the west division this year and you have to finish the game this time we finished
3419571 its wallys team he calls the shots ill roll with the punches im just glad we got the victory but ill be back in the middle of the saddle come two weeks from now
3419572 it feels good after taking two devastating losses like we did in the last minutes it was good to be able to come back and answer the call when all the adversity was against us and they had the momentum on their side
3419573 even though we had the momentum they found a way to get a big play there and turn it around it was good that we were able to stay poised and composed and go out there when we had the ball on an opportunity to close it out and we did just that
3419574 as a running back you want the load on your shoulders the offensive line played well against a good defence they throw a lot at you we had three rookie offensive linemen they definitely held their ground tonight
3419575 we came out like gangbusters and gave them an opportunity to come back offensively we couldnt get anything going in the third quarter and then we gave them so many free chances thats something we havent done all year
3419576 we were making a lot of plays but were turning the ball over and keeping them in the game there they were doing a good job of capitalizing on turnovers
3419577 it was close i wish we did what we did in the fourth quarter in the third and second quarter and first quarter it was a tough one it felt like we were flat we have to find a way to pick it up quicker than we did
3419578 were not going to use injuries as an excuse i know me personally i have a lot of confidence in the guys that play so im not using that as an excuse at all
3419579 there would always be one play that we dont make and weve got to make that play to keep the drive going
3419580 like ryan expressed some guys are playing good some arent in this sport as everybody knows its not a one man show its the team the team has to win and were not getting a team effort right now
3419581 im not going to go there tonight im going to enjoy this tonight then watch the film friday well do whats right for our football team
3419582 i dont want to start a quarterback controversy richie played well the team responds to him it isnt always pretty but he has a knack of making plays
3419583 im just biding my time until he printers comes back
3419584 they have our number this year weve beaten them a number of times in the past but not now well have it figured out by labour day
3419585 it got away from us in the third quarter they took it away from us
3419586 its a tough one to swallow especially coming against an eastern opponent it was frustrating in the second half they did a lot of different things on second down and made some good adjustments
3419587 our offence has been doing a great job driving the ball down the field and putting it in the end zone and those times that we dont get into the end zone its my job to come out and put it through the uprights im definitely feeling good and i just have to continue doing it every week
3419588 everybody knows how the cfl works the flip flops the first half of the season and the second half of the season teams get hot and you want to be in first place to be in first place says a lot because everybody talent wise theres a lot of parity
3419589 thats the great balance of our team theres a lot of weapons
3419590 came inside the motor home and started yelling and punching me
3419591 i was unfaithful to janet back in the 80s and whenever she drank alcohol she would start fighting with me and bring that up
3419592 janet came after me punching me in the face she broke my glasses
3419593 i then grabbed janet by the throat with my right hand we both struggled a bit and she ended up on the floor i held on to janet by the throat until she stopped struggling with me
3419594 i grabbed janet under the arms and dragged her out of the motor home i dragged her about 100 yards into the woods i dug a hole about two to three feet deep i put janet in the hole face up then covered her body with dirt and left
3419595 no one would believe that i killed her in self defense

3419606 we are all worried it was a military regime maaouya ould taya government that pushed us out and now its another military takeover we were promised by the president abdallahi that we would be treated equally that we are all mauritanians
3419607 in recent months sidi ould cheikh abdallahi has made overtures to islamist groups and brokered power exchanges with ould tayas previous ministers if this coup had not happened a return to power from ould taya would have been inevitable

3419636 going up that early in the game was just an awesome start for us
3419637 that was a killer goal to concede against a team with the quality of the u s
3419638 this win says a lot about the character of the players on this team
3419639 we just want to keep getting better in each game and that was important today
3419640 i think its amazing the fact that we bounced back from that start
3419641 we are gaining confidence every single minute we are together

3419647 of course it wont be as exciting as seeing it in the venues
3419648 if we put 100 pounds of nitrogen on wheat we are lucky if 50 pounds ends up in the grain
3419649 it takes finding that variation and capturing that variation in our improved varieties

3419651 over the past few years the price of anhydrous ammonia has skyrocketed
3419652 reducing off farm inputs is just as important to organic growers as conventional growers
3419653 if they dont have a lot of animals it is expensive for organic growers to get enough fertilizer without trucking in manure or compost their transportation costs are prohibitive
3419654 obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3419655 i think i play one of my best matches in the last weeks on hard court
3419656 ive never played singles at the olympics so this has been really cool for me
3419657 every time i walk out there its like im playing in my match but at the same time i have the whole u s team on my side its good i really like that feeling
3419658 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3419659 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3419660 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3419661 i played really clean matches in the past the next one would be kind of streaky i dont want to do that any more i just want to keep playing the same consistency

3419672 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3419673 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3419674 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3419675 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3419676 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3419677 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3419678 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
3419679 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3419680 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended
3419681 clarity on an issue that if it was left broad and ambiguous could be a serious problem for the home building industry here in california for home builders clarity in the rules is always always helpful
3419682 encouragement from both sides of the aisle to see if we couldnt bring about steps that would make the endangered species act more effective

3419730 it is a lesson to us all that captains are not necessarily born they can be made
3419731 kevin pietersen might not be the best captain in the world in the next few months but he can learn to become a great captain just as michael vaughan did vaughan got better and better with each game
3419732 it always seemed vaughan and fletcher were still close and certainly closer than vaughan and moores that is understandable but now there is a chance for pietersen and moores to create a bond
3419733 it was really good work by birgit to get by two defenders
3419734 its typical birgit to go like that and win it but as a forward i have to expect and anticipate that the goalkeeper will not be able to hold that shot
3419735 with three points the north koreans still had a chance of reaching the last eight as one of the two best third place teams but that hope vanished when japan overturned norways 27th minute lead through guro knutsen with five goals in shanghai
3419736 i dont think the result is because japans was a fantastic performance
3419737 after 3 1 down we got the message that the united states was three or four goals up and we needed a get a point in order to win the group
3419738 we gambled and put more players up front and a few less in defense and japan was very good at counter attack
3419739 the most important thing for us is to forget the game and start thinking about the quarterfinal against brazil
3419740 going up that early in the game was just an awesome start for us
3419741 china topped group e by beating argentina 2 0 on an own goal by midfielder maria quinones and a late strike by substitute gu yasha
3419742 it was the result of our pressure we got a lot of penalty corners and won off a penalty corner
3419743 we woke up in the second half and played with a lot more emotion a lot more power which you didnt see at the beginning
3419744 we knew it was going to be not the cleanest of games out there and we tried really hard to play a decent game of hockey
3419745 that was a huge stone that fell from my heart

3419754 we dont rely on dr thaksins money when manager mark hughes makes a decision we go through the normal process which can include banks finance or a whole bunch of different things just like any other club

3419756 i must apologise again for deciding to come to live in england if i am fortunate enough i will return and die on thai soil just like other thais
3419757 we have to establish the status of his return to england and where that leaves him as regards to the legal process in thailand
3419758 we need to make sure if he is guilty of anything we will deal with it
3419759 i dont know how this is going to work when theres a lot of people here
3419760 but it is something that is fully outside of our control
3419761 there are three kinds of lies lies damn lies and statistics

3419763 if someone is able to obtain a passport ration card election identification card and nationalality certificate by illegal means it doesnt meant that one is an indian national until and unless one gets his nationality through legal means
3419764 deportation is a process and not a punishment an increasing number of illegal immigrants in the capital are posing a great danger to our internal security
3419765 the government is committed to providing comprehensive fire safety coverage in the capital hence it has planned the commissioning of more fire stations

3419775 when people in illinois are living from paycheck to paycheck and hurtin we got to stop that
3419776 it feels to me just like a natural step for us to take
3419777 its always exciting to shake things up a bit and to grow and to do things differently
3419778 weve been challenged at the newsstand recently which is an industry wide trend and the decline pretty much mirrors where we are vis a vis our competitors

3419780 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3419781 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3419782 i had my best result there last year and i am not going to put too much pressure on myself
3419783 the injury is to a weight bearing part of the foot and the doctors say that using too much pressure on the pegs could very easily give me some big problems
3419784 i went to dr ting and got the opinion of other specialists ive done a lot with ting he knows the sport very well and he feels it would be quite risky to ride he and the other specialists say that if i rode this week i might have to fight the injury for the rest of the year
3419785 as hard a decision as it is and as bad as i feel about it i think im better off staying home doing rehab and physio then come back fit at misano and try to finish the season strong
3419786 as a team its our best to date every time we ride those bikes they get better i cant wait until weve got a full season under our belts on the yamaha and really start to see this teams potential
3419787 vesrahs tray batey is a hard guy to beat i got down to the 1 14s but it just wasnt enough i figured that running within a second of the time set by the second place qualifier in open superstock would be enough but it wasnt there was nothing else we as a team could have done but if youre going to get beat you want to get beat by the best competition in the paddock
3419788 traffic is tough at that track but we put our heads down and stayed out of trouble it was a good weekend even though we didnt win this was a good confidence booster for barber next month thats a riders track and i think the r1s will be great there
3419789 the guys rode well and pulled us back up even though we had to make up time against such stiff competition
3419790 we only had one person reuben frankenfield in the pits helping both teams so that made it hard to do
3419791 i got back out and did my best to get back up to speed
3419792 then i ended up having a wardrobe malfunction the zipper on my leathers came down i thought i was going to get a black flag so i pulled in to fix my leathers after that it was an uneventful race
3419793 i got new tires for my second stint and set a 1 15 3 my fastest time of the race and i had a good time out there
3419794 in my third stint i had to pace myself to conserve fuel and tires the low fuel light came on with eight laps to go usually we can only get four laps after the light comes on so i had to short shift and really conserve it was a really fun race
3419795 i had to take it easy on the front tire at the end but still managed to maintain our lap times
3419796 mike rode the best ive seen all year and chuck said it was the best hes seen me ride everything worked out really well
3419797 i went out in the second hour and the bike felt good even on old tires i got good times and it went pretty easy there were no issues i felt good on the bike and were proud of third in class i wish we could have finished better overall but it was a smooth race and i think well do well at barber
3419798 hats off to roman and gabor they rode a high risk race in spite of the bad weather they could afford to though because they didnt have much to lose i had to be more careful because i wanted to gain third place in the overall positioning in wet conditions the rules are different and its a whole other ball game this time titleholders martin bauer honda and werner daemen yoshimura van zon schafer motorsport suzuki came off badly
3419799 once again the results depended on whether the tyre gamble paid off or not the state of the championships counted a lot for us as well andy meklau is now the best suzuki rider and has moved up from fourth place to third place in the table his other suzuki colleagues werner daemen and roman stamm have taken up positions behind him we might not be able to win the title but we will show everyone just how strong we are in the final
3419800 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3419801 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3419926 in the eyes of the companys critics and even some orthodox rabbis the fact that agriprocessors paid for the trip rendered the rabbis conclusions suspect neither of the national councils two news releases regarding the trip disclosed that agriprocessors had footed the bill for the rabbis
3419927 if theyre going and being paid by rubashkin plants owner then that should be forthrightly disclosed
3419928 its very important if rabbis are going that things look totally above board and that its 100 percent clear that the desire is to do the right thing and not just the expedient thing
