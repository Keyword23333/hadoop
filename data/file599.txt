5990000 but you see billy there hes been travelling all round the world with zaur with a family at home the time he puts into this sport is unbelievable im proud of him thats from the heart
5990001 him and zaur all the time away from their kids and family it must be hard for them ive no kids and gary keegan hes outside in the crowd he should be in with us but thats for another day i think its a disgrace
5990002 hes a good boxer but i wasnt going to box his fight i closed him down as i was told put my right hand in his face i just felt i was too strong and too fast for him
5990003 the indian technical team has been in nepal for last several days to reinforce and strengthen the spurs and the embankment on the saptkoshi river in consultation with the local administration
5990004 despite repeated requests and pleas by the technical team for urgent local support in view of the gravity of the situation the support from local administration had not been forthcoming as a result the work was frequently delayed
5990005 at the same time the indian technical team was directed to carry out the work on day and night basis
5990006 the indian technical team mobilised required resources and has remained in readiness to carry out the required work to strengthen the embankment but it was prevented from reaching the site
5990007 as a result thousands of people in nepal and india have been forced to suffer a calamity that could have been avoided
5990008 while the indian technical team is ready to undertake protective measures this will become possible only if it receives necessary cooperation from the government of nepal and support from the local people
5990009 being a fast intense spectator sport it suits young peoples expectations
5990010 in china alone more than 102 million people watched the games live online
5990011 the ou initiative is the only major us initiative of its kind devoted to the problem of biodeterioration and biocorrosion
5990012 first we have to understand how mother nature cleans up these spills and we can do this by studying the way microorganisms interact with hydrocarbons
5990013 we want to better understand how organisms eat through these pipelines several fundamental mechanisms cause this problem but it is spotty and doesnt occur all of a sudden
5990014 rather biocorrosion occurs over a long period of time and we are using a series of new molecular and chemical tools to find out why and how this happens
5990015 we think cells grow in communities that adhere to the inner surface of pipelines and form three dimensional biofilms that can sometimes cause pitting once we understand what these microorganisms are doing we can interrupt their processes or diagnose them more effectively
5990016 because two thirds of us oil is still in place we can use these organisms to convert residual hydrocarbons into natural gas and create a new source of domestic energy
5990017 the concept of anaerobic metabolism is an innovative process and the ou initiative is the only one of its kind in the united states at the present time we are also experimenting with shales and other unconventional reservoirs
5990018 this is not fair that im not able to see my only grandchild i want to see this little baby
5990019 recent attempts to establish contact with the family were hardly welcome
5990020 issued an order of protection after he complained that she was harassing him
5990021 i had depression to use that against me is wrong
5990022 after mr cantrell died i took a little old mule he had and plowed me a vegetable garden and had plenty of vegetables to eat it was hard times you had to work to eat
5990023 ive worked hard my whole life and did what i had to what i could to survive i didnt want to talk about it for a while because i didnt want people to gossip about it i didnt want people to make it out to be worse than it was
5990024 in terms of preparing them for the world we need to redefine our attitudes towards traditional ideas of cheating unless the students have a conceptual understanding of the topic or what they are working on they can t access bits and pieces of information to support them in a task effectively
5990025 in their working lives they will never need to carry enormous amounts of information around in their heads
5990026 what they will need to do is access information from all their sources quickly and they will need to check the reliability of their information
5990027 i was a bit hesitant because i didn t know how it could help us but i don t think it is cheating after having done it twice it just helps you find information to answer the question appropriately
5990028 are we in a recession and what does it mean to you
5990029 a key to this is the pitfalls of greed and fear
5990030 stocks arent for everybody and theyre not for all the time you have to understand how to invest without emotion
5990031 this is not a program for people who believe they can get rich quick
5990032 van elke winkel kon het personeel een andere baan krijgen of zal het een andere baan krijgen ofwel bij de overnemer ofwel in de andere winkels
5990033 in deze tijden van dalende koopkracht zullen we evolueren naar het outlet concept door onze collecties van de vorige jaren te verkopen
5990034 burgemeester guy co me verklaarde gisteren op een persconferentie dat de voorzitter van rs waremmien zijn functie als beheerder van het stadion niet meer kon uitoefenen hij voegde eraan toe dat indien hij geen ontslag nam de stad de aangekondigde investeringen voor het gemeentelijke stadion zou bevriezen
5990035 ik had me aan die stellingname van guy co me verwacht en ik zal de zaak niet polemiseren zoals ik aankondigde vertrek ik van zodra ik een rem ben dat is het geval dus trek ik me terug als voorzitter
5990036 er is dus werk aan de winkel op de werkvloer en bij het rekruteren
5990037 het zijn niet alleen de jobinhoud en het loon maar ook de sfeer in een bedrijf die maken of iemand gelukkig is in zijn of haar job bedrijven vinden al moeilijk de juiste medewerkers ze kunnen dan ook beter hun best doen om het werk zo aangenaam mogelijk te maken om te vermijden dat hun werknemers van job gaan veranderen
5990038 mode is duidelijk nog steeds een bloeiende industrie ondanks de economische crisis vrouwen zoeken wel meer naar koopjes online dan dat ze naar de winkels trekken
5990039 de federatieraad is bereid het onafhankelijke statuut van zuid osseti en abchazi te erkennen als de mensen in die regios dit wensen en als een besluit in die richting genomen wordt door de russische president
5990040 challenging some of the fundamental tenets of the existing global economic system
5990041 it took me a while to let things go you just have to work through that stuff it takes a few years divorce is really awful a lot of people go through that more than once and i dont know how they do it i mean once was enough for me
5990042 were in this time when you have to be young and pretty weve gone back to that
5990043 there were a lot of people 10 or 15 years ago who were putting on funny clothes and playing some kind of country music who were dabbling
5990044 blue mountain was really authentic they were blending country blues and rock in an interesting way that only two or three bands were doing
5990045 it was one of the most happening places culturally in the country
5990046 fat possum records was based there so you had r l burnside and junior kimbrough and all those guys and oxford had this literary scene with larry brown and barry hannah there was a lot going on and we were kind of musically in the center of it
5990047 theres probably going to be periods of time where im probably not going to be making enough money from music and ill have to get an additional job
5990048 i mean thats how things have changed before we sold enough records and we made enough money on the road where we could really not worry about that for a while live show attendance has been up and down for everybody not just for us weve been lucky because we still have the markets where we did really well and were still doing really well but that could go away too
5990049 i have to say the one thing im glad to see is were also picking up some younger fans people who have heard of the band but never seen us or heard about us from their older brothers and sisters because if we were just playing to our old fans those people are like in the 30s and 40s now so theyve got kids you know theyre not packing the clubs anymore
5990050 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5990051 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5990052 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5990053 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5990054 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5990055 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5990056 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5990057 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5990058 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5990059 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5990060 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5990061 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5990062 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5990063 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5990064 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5990065 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5990066 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5990067 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5990068 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5990069 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5990070 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5990071 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5990072 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5990073 playing hockey you can almost tell just by looking at them that this person might be more aggressive than another person
5990074 we wanted to see the extent to which these individual differences in the face would actually be correlated with aggressive behaviour
5990075 we found that in men the facial metric that we used was correlated with how aggressive men were on this computer test
5990076 there was no such relationship in women it was only in men
5990077 we think that testosterone levels around puberty might be partly responsible for shaping the facial width to height ratio
5990078 not only would it shape the facial width to height ratio but it might shape their brains to be more aggressive
5990079 the sad fact is that come christmas time we estimate that one million australians will suffer mortgage stress thats a huge number of people that are potentially going to face losing their property unless drastic action is taken
5990080 sydney got richer in the first five years of the new century but that new wealth was very unevenly spread about
5990081 most of us dont realize that we move our eyes around three or four times a second
5990082 and there is some process in the brain that were interested in that somehow puts all this information together from these different glimpses we have of the world
5990083 and thats enough basically as you walk or drive you create this sort of sketchpad of whats around you
5990084 the reason were not literally killing each other right and left on the roads is that we have the capacity to keep track of objects to the left or right even though you cant see the cars
5990085 the parietal cortex is very involved in constructing this image of where things are
5990086 the brain uses electrochemistry and any kind of chemistry is going to affect it as well
5990087 if you break down attention and eye movement mechanisms people are going to act like they dont know what is going on left and right
5990088 most people when they think vision they immediately think eye but when we say vision were mainly thinking how the brain processes it
5990089 and we are one of the best places in the world at doing this
5990090 a lot of people here at the school dont realize that this is canadas largest vision research centre
5990091 most of the experiments we do in here look at the perception of self orientation how you know youve moved or how you know which way is up
5990092 so one of the neat things here is that if your body is telling you up is this way and gravity is telling you up is this way and your vision is telling you up is another way we can make the vision go in any direction we want because were generating it
5990093 it was a fact that the republicans were doing the same thing in minneapolis

5990099 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5990100 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5990101 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5990102 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5990103 top 16 was our aim and weve bettered that with 14th thats an amazing achievement
5990104 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5990105 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5990106 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5990107 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5990108 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5990109 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5990110 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5990111 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5990112 who are open to doing something on the production side
5990113 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5990114 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5990115 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5990116 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5990117 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5990118 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5990119 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5990120 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5990121 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5990122 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5990123 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5990124 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5990125 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5990126 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5990127 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5990128 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5990129 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5990130 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5990131 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5990132 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5990133 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5990134 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5990135 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5990136 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

5990145 olha eu conhe o o meu filho em casa na escola ele um outro menino que faz coisas que eu n o estou vendo ent o eu parto do princ pio que ele pode sim ter feito essas coisas junto com os outros meninos
5990146 ent o meu filho como voc pode fazer medo a um outro menino menor como vamos resolver isso
5990147 que tal conversar com seus coleguinhas e falar que isso n o est legal acha que uma boa id ia
5990148 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5990149 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5990150 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5990151 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5990152 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5990153 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5990154 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5990155 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5990156 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5990157 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5990158 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5990159 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

5990168 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5990169 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5990170 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5990171 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

5990175 he has his own reasons for not coming back with ireland hopefully in the future he might come back hes still relatively young and he might come out of retirement or whatever you call the situation that andys in
5990176 i have asked him about it lots of times and hes never said that the doors closed so maybe he will be back in the future theres a chance and it would be great to see him as hed improve the squad hes a top class player
5990177 having spoken to andy about it a lot over the last few months i would never say never he has never said to me for certain that hes finished with ireland and that hes never coming back so theres a chance he might play for ireland again
5990178 hes an irishman hes proud to have played for his country but at the moment its just not right for him to play with us a few months down the line he might feel its right to come back if the manager picks him
5990179 i think he feels he was hung out to dry a bit after that 5 2 defeat in cyprus that was one of the main reasons though not the only one for him backing out of things with ireland hes a big boy and he can take criticism but it was a build up of things not just the criticism that hurt andy and made him step away from the irish squad
5990180 its a fresh start for a lot of people in this squad myself and steven reid were both out for a good while with injury so i know i am determined to stay injury free and stay in the squad for as long as possible
5990181 if i can do that and play well for bolton hopefully the ireland situation will look after itself
5990182 this game is only a friendly but its a big match for us were looking for a good result and a good performance leading into the qualifiers next month
5990183 if i can stay injury free and stay in the bolton team i have a good chance with ireland
5990184 i am not worried you have to give them time he is 19 years old
5990185 duke of marmalade had been travelling since 5am and had landed before the inspection
5990186 if he hadnt travelled over wed be in a better position to decide whether hell run on friday but having travelled over and back once hed be at a big disadvantage if we sent him back
5990187 i was told of the situation by course clerk william derby new approach was at the airport and we decided to bring him home
5990188 ill be discussing the situation with john ferguson chief bloodstock agent to sheikh mohammed wife of new approachs owner princess haya in the morning but id say at this stage the chances of new approach running on friday are no more than 50 50

5990190 it is the first time ive picked him in the squad i followed him last season for three or four games and he didnt play well and for me was not fit
5990191 but i saw his last game and he is fit now and looked in very good form i think he is an interesting player but i must stress the door is not closed for peter crouch

5990198 it is very frustrating and disappointing for all this to happen
5990199 everything was going well for the new date until rogies hands started to give him bother over a week ago
5990200 he complained of them being sore after a sparring session in the gym and when we went to the hospital we were told by the doctor he would have to lay off sparring for a few weeks
5990201 four emergency service staff were taken to a nearby hospital after suffering smoke related injuries and nine people who were in the building also suffered from smoke inhalation
5990202 the problem is that the building is built of wood and this helped the fire to spread everyone is working to bring the situation under control
5990203 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5990204 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5990205 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits

5990207 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5990208 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5990209 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5990210 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

5990228 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5990229 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5990230 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
5990231 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5990232 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
5990233 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
5990234 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
5990235 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
5990236 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry

5990241 we will have to repatriate him back to vietnam because he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter
5990242 he could be returned to his homeland since we do not want him here
5990243 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
5990244 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5990245 we dont feel its appropriate he spends his time hopping from one country to the next one while countries decide what to do with him

5990263 duke of marmalade had been travelling since 5am and had landed before the inspection

5990265 i was told of the situation by course clerk william derby new approach was at the airport and we decided to bring him home
5990266 ill be discussing the situation with john ferguson chief bloodstock agent to sheikh mohammed wife of new approachs owner princess haya in the morning but id say at this stage the chances of new approach running on friday are no more than 50 50

5990273 the moment the lebanese government confers legitimacy on hezbollah it must understand that the entire lebanese state will be a target in the same way that all of israel is a target for hezbollah
5990274 during the second lebanese war we considered the possibility of attacking lebanons infrastructure but we never resorted to this option because we thought at the time that all the lebanese were not responsible for the hezbollah attacks
5990275 the moment hezbollah takes control of the lebanese government we will have to address the consequences
5990276 the right of lebanon its people its army and its resistance to liberate its land
5990277 during the war in lebanon we had a massive capacity that we refrained from using because we were fighting a terrorist organisation and not a state but if lebanon becomes a hezbollah state we will not be so restrained

5990283 there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports this is evident from its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
5990284 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying that delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
5990285 we allow our users to find information about their potential legal claims and determine whether they are qualified for a particular claim without disclosing confidential information then our patent pending model pairs them with attorneys from their area who handle similar claims

5990298 over the past four years weve unified the amalgamated city established a firm foundation for the future by creating a council organisation that is well managed financially prudent and engaged with our diverse communities
5990299 make no mistake ousting the clover moore party will be tough
5990300 we have developed a range of chapters which essentially provide information on a number of topics that come up in our day to day work that people want more information on
5990301 for the ease of our clients and in the hopes of reaching more people we have consolidated a whole lot of information into easy to digest chunks
5990302 we serve a lot of people face to face but not all people living with hiv can make it in to our offices particularly given the changing nature of how peoples experiences have changed
5990303 so if youre working nine to five in parramatta it might be difficult to make contact with a community based organisation so this is about maximising our reach
5990304 these results indicate that colorectal pretreatment with arv drugs such as tenofovir has potential as a clinically relevant strategy for the prevention of hiv transmission
5990305 the main role of wires is to rescue and rehabilitate injured or orphaned native animals and to educate the public it is this last duty that is probably the most important in the long term if people dont understand the importance of our wildlife then they wont act to protect it
5990306 i hope that the future will see membership grow and our skills increase i hope that carers groups across the country will unite and eventually have the ability to influence government policy to consider our native flora and fauna
5990307 once new members are more experienced they can specialise in the care of their favourite animal be it birds bats mammals frogs or snakes
5990308 i dont know that i have the words to express the pure joy that you get after raising a little animal that came to you with its eyes still closed and seeing it fly away or scamper up a tree to begin its life with its own kind
5990309 we have two new singles in the can already the next one we are testing at clubs at the moment is called happiness
5990310 its got a rare and unreleased sample from a bob marley track which never actually saw the light of day
5990311 the next one after that weve teamed up with iva davies from icehouse and funnily enough even though our styles are different they both seem to go hand in hand its a great summer record
5990312 catchy vocals that people can sing along to fairly quickly and understand what its all about
5990313 it also needs to have a beat because you can never just have a strong vocal you need music to back it up
5990314 the melody needs to be very strong so once people hear it they feel that theyve known it all their life the vocal becomes the most important part because its what they remember
5990315 to be honest ive mixed six of the nine one love series and its the first one ive done as tv rock
5990316 i think its probably the best one because its the most up to date musically we got a lot of tracks that are going to be big moving forward in the next couple of months

5990321 musicals are always camp weve got a eurasian boy with a fondness for interpretive dancing a big haired stage mother from hell and line dancing
5990322 i think comedy is always the hardest form of entertainment to direct a depressing show with multiple murders would be easy by comparison
5990323 i have a short attention span so i want a show to be fast fun energetic and send the audience out feeling better than when they came in when you achieve that it is worth all the effort
5990324 we as a nation have become more affluent people dont really care so much now because life has become so fast paced and business driven that people arent concerned about these trivial matters any more
5990325 i disagree when some people say that its because malaysian society is now more open
5990326 society has become so materialist that entrepreneurs look at any way to make money someone had the foresight to cash in on the pink dollar
5990327 it was an injustice the case does reflect badly on gay people
5990328 but it was a political move on behalf of mahathir the former prime minister who used this law for his own political gain
5990329 its not a huge issue for him he says he wants equal rights for everyone and no one should be disadvantaged but he cant be a gay activist
5990330 if he attempts to do that his supporters will turn away from him the malaysian government is dominated by muslim parties
5990331 i had it much easier than my muslim friends a few ended up having to get married because that is what society wanted them to do

5990337 theres something a bit more heartfelt about winning an award like this youre doing something positive for the community rather than having a judge come along to see you perform
5990338 im happy to win something but i dont go to win at the divas youre supposed to be glamorous and each drag queen is trying to get the most attention when i walked into the room i had everyone looking at me i guess as a professional showgirl its always good to show everyone else that i just dont wear a pretty dress and do things out of the box

5990364 there are approximately 250 million people out there who are interested in these kinds of products and have made purchases from spam in the past thats equivalent to double the population of japan mixed in with every other internet user as a spammer how do you reach that market without knowing specifically who these people are and with the bare minimum of expense easy send lots of emails to everyone

5990371 this is the first time that a study provides evidence that in the human brain dopamine is involved in the adaptations that result from sleep deprivation
5990372 these findings suggest dopamine may increase after sleep deprivation as a compensatory response to the effects of increased sleep drive in the brain
5990373 the extent to which this occurs may differentiate how vulnerable people are to the neurobehavioral effects of sleep loss

5990429 we must realise that we are the hope of our people and therefore cannot afford to fail

5990432 indeed our individual and collective rating was at an all time low at such moments

5990434 a situation whereby only about 20 per cent of experienced lawmakers return to the parliament after every legislative session will work against quality legislation needed for a strong democracy
5990435 such cases were really a major distraction to many members
5990436 we have laid a very solid foundation with which we can now determine a national agenda for the populace

5990457 uno de los principales argumentos para invadir georgia fue el supuesto deseo de proteger a ciudadanos rusos

5990480 locarno has an excellent reputation in the tourist and cultural fields
5990481 and we are proud that a swiss airbus a320 will now carry its name to all of europes major airports

5990485 and as our countrys ambassador we are proud to represent locarno and canton ticino this wonderful region in switzerlands south
5990486 you spoke so beautifully you have to make this a reality otherwise it will remain a speech
5990487 i get to shift economies its extremely liberating i breathe differently
5990488 its never a full implementation it is easier to dream than to do
5990489 in america and australia it has to be outside the car
5990490 she pulls in then shes squeezing between two cars to drag out this big cable and walk it back to her car shell be wearing her nice work clothes and getting them dirty
5990491 weve just lost half the market you need to make life simple for people
5990492 but at the end what you want is a snowflake
5990493 what do we need to make this happen two servos two degrees of movement for the arm
5990494 this is the driver experience he goes into a spot and the spot connects itself in 2008 we put the cable in the unit in 2010 we use an arm in 2012 theres a smart arm that connects automatically for the home unit the users get a pull cable for free or they pay 500 and they get autoconnect itll cost 250 to build and well sell it for 500
5990495 by the time hes thought of something to him its been completed its been achieved
5990496 the other trait is that by the time youve understood what hes thinking hes already somewhere else youre in catch up mode 24 7
5990497 in order to bring about this dramatic change sometimes we need a boy like in the fairy tales to say look the emperor has no clothes we can all see that for ourselves so how come we havent said so and this boy comes along and puts things in motion to bring about change and the boy in this story and he really is a boy practically but he has achieved more than many adults have is of course shai agassi
5990498 when you want a fish you get a woman and when you want a woman you get a fish
5990499 he had the self image of being an equal to steve jobs or michael dell or bill gates
5990500 even if this ends up destroying for lack of a better word my refinery business that will be small money compared to what this will be when you play chess you give up something to get something else
5990501 we wouldnt have invested if we thought this was a onetime one place story
5990502 you dont have the normal car problem where you need first gear to get off the line we just took the original transmission and stuck it permanently in second
5990503 when you take your foot off the pedal the car has kinetic energy
5990504 the motor starts charging the battery turning the kinetic energy back to electric energy
5990505 if youre regening it means you used too much energy in the first place
5990506 ah you are not a computer its not like you can calculate how much energy you need to get to that red light
5990507 every time you do regen theres a loss its not like you get it all back
5990508 the perfect driver would cruise around without ever using regen or the brakes when they came to their destination they would coast to a stop
5990509 zero percent tax on our cars dong as a partner
5990510 but there was already 0 percent tax on alternative energy cars in denmark

5990513 we are not aware of any reason why automakers would not sign up for this
5990514 i have so many sins to pay on my climate bill right now that we hope this works really fast
5990515 we separated the ownership of the car and the ownership of the battery see car companies dont know how to assess the life of the battery so they go through these complicated programs of testing them for a long period of time and we told the car company you know what just like you dont sell a car with a card that says here is oil for the life of the car you dont sell cars with the batteries for the life of the car because the battery is crude oil
5990516 if we also buy clean generation we reduce the price of clean electrons so that at the end of 10 years clean electrons are cheaper than coal based electrons and nobody builds another coal plant at that point thats another 40 percent of co2 emissions thats the treaty tony blair is now working to get for the world by 2050 im telling you we can get there a decade after we finish the car side we can get there in 2030 60 percent reduction in our co2 emissions
5990517 i joke that 29 days a month shais my boss and one day a month

5990537 the onus is now on us to address the situation that we find ourselves in
5990538 to take a practical example an electric motor running under no load uses very little power if the motor were frictionless and superconducting it would use no power this is because the back emf opposes the imposed voltage

5990631 ich erf lle mir hier meinen traum die teilnahme an olympia
5990632 damn what happened to the summertime cookouts everytime i turn around a n igga gettin took out shit my momma got cancer in her breast dont ask me why im motherfu ckin stressed
5990633 i know my mother wished she got a fuckin abortion
5990634 i finished off the olympic games with to me the most perfect ending ever
5990635 to finally get the gold medal on my very last routine meant the world to me
5990636 we went out there and showed we are the best going 1 2 in the all around thats never been done by the united states the americans have never had 1 2 on beam before either and 2 3 on floor isnt too bad
5990637 four years ago we had a large failure and we blamed ourselves
5990638 i would never trade one of my silvers for gold
5990639 what i went through to get them is very special to me and really touched my heart
5990640 she came in with the possibility of winning a few gold medals and that hasnt happened we were running out of chances
5990641 i knew it wasnt quite my best routine but i knew it was enough for a medal but im really happy for shawn three silvers is kind of hard to take i couldnt be more proud of her
5990642 thats the great ending she was a little bit disappointed after the all around but she went all the way to the end i can appreciate that
5990643 to finally have a gold and be an olympic gold medalist its what everyone dreams of
5990644 i hit the floor and i looked at mark and said can you believe that just happened
5990645 you cant be upset with two medals at my first olympics
5990646 bryan is world class but the south africans have a remarkable ability to produce speedy wings
5990647 i did not watch the match between the springboks and argentina and i did not see jongis try but i played against him in the super 14
5990648 ive seen a little bit of him nokwe through the super 14
5990649 hes a quick elusive type of player the same sort of mould as bryan habana
5990650 habana is obviously a world class player but they the springboks have got plenty of class players right across the field
5990651 we certainly dont hold him habana above anyone else in the side nor dictate our gameplan around him so the boks certainly dont lose too much without him
5990652 everyone whos in their the springbok squad im sure will be eager and have that enthusiasm to go out there and prove to the selectors and the coaches that they can do the job as well
5990653 they have been playing an attacking expansive type of game and i think theyll keep going with that
5990654 it is up to us to make sure we are on our game with our defensive policies and that sort of thing
5990655 if there is any opportunity for turnovers or things like that we can hopefully sting them back
5990656 with these new elvs it certainly creates a lot more opportunity at full back in terms of counter attack and turn over ball and getting your hands on the ball as much as you can
5990657 certainly late in the halves when the bigger guys are getting fatigued there is some scope there to try and get involved and get a few mismatches
5990658 this week ive been training at both wing and full back im giving myself every opportunity to prepare in case i do get that call up
5990659 obviously with coopie ashley cooper out theres an opportunity at full back if its me who gets the job ill be very excited

5990686 alongside the magic of auction style sales buyers increasingly want the convenience of shopping for great value often new items at a fixed price this is fuelling a big growth in the number of large and small sellers using ebay in this way
5990687 todays improvements will remove barriers for sellers so they can make the most of this opportunity and offer even more goods for sale on ebay that means even greater choice for buyers and in turn greater success for sellers
5990688 weve definitely been excited about the growth and embrace of technology by both voters and candidates
5990689 its been explosive its light years from 2004 youtube didnt exist four years ago and now it is being heavily used for politics
5990690 google is attempting to expand its influence over the political process to help it achieve its commercial goals
5990691 google likes to bask in self congratulatory rhetoric claiming it has the publics interests at heart its all about accessing peoples data for targeted marketing
5990692 in this us election year what information could be more important than the candidates own words to describe their views actions and platforms
5990693 as idealistic as that sounds is as idealistic as we are it is exciting all around not just for google
5990694 this new politics is disruptive upsetting old arrangements and displacing people invested in the old ways

5990700 in both print ad sales and online traffic businessweek ranks far ahead of most other financial magazines but lags behind its closest competitors its web site draws more than three million unique visitors monthly according to nielsen online a healthy figure but forbes com gets more than eight million no directly comparable figure is available for fortune whose online presence is contained within cnnmoney site with more than nine million monthly users
5990701 in the first six months of 2008 businessweek had more than 900 ad pages according to the magazine publishers association while fortune had more than 1 100 and forbes more than 1 300 though print sales have held steady financial magazines have lost more than 20 percent of their print ad volume in the last four years and businessweeks advertising has fallen even faster
5990702 roger w neal senior vice president and general manager of businessweek digital said that as business exchange pages work their way up through search engine results the site should double businessweeks traffic on the web within two years allowing it to sell more ads
5990703 the market has been pacing up and down at low levels for a long time investors have all been waiting for a chance
5990704 the market should rebound but i dont think it means a return to a bull market in just one day since there arent any actual policies being announced
5990705 a directive order has been issued to the government to provide basic human rights including education and health care to the child
5990706 this means the childs rights cant be violated in the name of culture
5990707 i wish i could just give her the medal right now
5990708 he just came to pick up what was already his
5990709 because if it should have been me i would have been out there im not going to be jealous of my brother
5990710 i want to be where hes at gold medal hanging around my neck
5990711 he has two more cycles in him and he hasnt come close to how good he can be
5990712 indignation was evident as he denounced the political attacks leveled by mccain
5990713 your site is amazing i love photography too hopefully i can learn a thing or two from you
5990714 you are an excellent professional and your blog is very special with great photos a hug from brazil
5990715 i dont understand your language but the photographs of your blog are very nice
5990716 you take beautiful photos i really enjoyed visiting your site thanks for sharing it with me
5990717 thanks for dropping by keep up with those great shots
5990718 i dont want them to leave until the job is done
5990719 we need compromise here not everyone can get stuck in their ideology
5990720 i didnt find the meeting to be helpful in fact i think it was a little unhelpful
5990721 im tired of hearing the governor ask for tax increases
5990722 its just very frustrating to hear that time and again we are not going to raise taxes period

5990724 handicapped his side but insists he feels under no pressure to strengthen his squad in the transfer market
5990725 if a new signing happens it happens said ferguson who has not given up in his quest to take tottenham striker dimitar berbatov to old trafford
5990726 carlos tevez will be back for the portsmouth game next week anderson is due back from the olympics by the time we play liverpool and chelsea and wayne rooney will be more effective after playing 90 minutes against newcastle if we have to go with what weve got we will do
5990727 to draw the first game is disappointing particularly as we created enough chances to win the game were two points behind and weve given them chelsea a head start and were already playing catch up
5990728 carlos has been frightening in pre season he has been so sharp to lose him on top of the other injuries we have was a big blow
5990729 but we still should have been good enough to win the game it gave us another game under our belts and with players getting more match fitness with their international sides this week we will be raring to go at portsmouth
5990730 it was not the result we wanted but personally it was just great to be out there said campbell who was a big hit on loan at hull last term
5990731 it was what ive been working for ever since i joined the club ill be sticking around for a bit and will hopefully get another chance
5990732 solche projekte m ssten aber erst von milit rexperten gepr ft werden
5990733 whats happening right now is the world is moving beyond america the future is in many ways being shaped in distant places by foreign people
5990734 thats a big shift from a world in which america was at the center economically financially culturally militarily politically to a world in which there are more centers and many forces from india to china to brazil to south africa that have to be taken into account
5990735 the coalition has to address the issues and get on with it
5990736 the problem is asif zardari he does not want iftikhar chaudhry at any cost he wants his own judiciary
5990737 we wanted to see restoration of the judges happen within 24 hours
5990738 some of our partners had reservations over timing im very hopeful the country cannot afford a breakup of the coalition

5990741 if it wasnt profitable i wouldnt be able to stand here
5990742 this is the last friendly before the qualifiers and there will not be a lot of experiments but i have the possibility to get to know better some players like emile heskey
5990743 it is the first time ive picked him in the squad i followed him last season for three or four games and he didnt play well and for me was not fit
5990744 but i saw his last game and he is fit now and looked in very good form i think he is an interesting player but i must stress the door is not closed for peter crouch
5990745 i have a squad and all the players are important
5990746 tomorrow wednesday i will decide the first eleven but it is the last friendly match before the qualifiers
5990747 what am i looking for i want to see england play like a team with spirit and without fear and show big personality
5990748 this is very important for me i want to see this i want to see another step forward
5990749 every match is equally important and they are deservedly very proud of their team
5990750 i have played three times since last years opening of the new wembley but this will be different
5990751 weve got to tighten up the amateur programme so that in four years we do a whole lot better
5990752 the problem is that these days its all about money when its all about money this happens the guys are just thinking about money theres a kind of manipulation where the kids are being told go and turn pro gold medals arent important
5990753 the managers dont want the guys winning golds because then they have to pay them more
5990754 when you have a good amateur programme it helps develop well rounded boxers
5990755 look at the pro game now why do the championships change hands so quickly its because these guys dont know how to fight different styles
5990756 when youre a pro you avoid the fighters whose style doesnt suit your style it makes them weak amateur boxing is harder than pro you have to fight everybody in your draw

5990761 the system is against the provincial champions and it shouldnt be like that
5990762 going forward the provincial winners should get a home tie in the quarter finals there has to be some reward a provincial medal is okay and its great to win it but theres not as much meas on it anymore
5990763 cork have a lot of big physical men and i think its going to be very tight
5990764 duke of marmalade had been travelling since 5am and had landed before the inspection
5990765 if he hadnt travelled over wed be in a better position to decide whether hell run on friday but having travelled over and back once hed be at a big disadvantage if we sent him back
5990766 i was told of the situation by course clerk william derby new approach was at the airport and we decided to bring him home
5990767 ill be discussing the situation with john ferguson chief bloodstock agent to sheikh mohammed wife of new approachs owner princess haya in the morning but id say at this stage the chances of new approach running on friday are no more than 50 50
5990768 it is very frustrating and disappointing for all this to happen
5990769 everything was going well for the new date until rogies hands started to give him bother over a week ago
5990770 he complained of them being sore after a sparring session in the gym and when we went to the hospital we were told by the doctor he would have to lay off sparring for a few weeks
5990771 i am not worried you have to give them time he is 19 years old

5990774 error during the configuration of the host failed to update disk partition information
5990775 hopefully hell keep it going and not peak too early
5990776 im excited about the team even after losing three strong seniors
5990777 these new ones have been able to step in and not miss a beat
5990778 these guys are coming in and shooting in the 70s and low 80s were looking forward to the season hopefully well peak at the regional tournament
5990779 i think our team is coming together our goal again is to get back up to the state tournament
5990780 we know our regional is going to be tougher this year but we think weve got a chance if these freshmen continue to develop throughout the season
5990781 were trying to peak at the right time we didnt do that last year we peaked early last year
5990782 we finished third overall in the regional but they take the top two teams and nick missed individuals by four strokes last year so were hoping we can get him up there
5990783 were improving with each match and were improving with every stroke
5990784 im hoping that maybe we can shave some shots off here in the long run
5990785 phillip won two years ago and i think that has pushed everybody else to play a little bit better
5990786 adam made it for me last year he made it as an individual last year at grandview when he qualified in a playoff
5990787 basically from now until september 29 when the regionals start our goal is to improve because these matches are just a warmup to them we just want to try to get better between now and september
5990788 its a day to day game at any level that you play
5990789 you can practice as much as you want but your goal is to peak at the end of the season and just get better between now and then we had some pretty high scores today maybe we can get better between now and then
5990790 im counting on chandler making it to state as a medalist
5990791 im pretty sure if he just plays his game hell be able to go back to the state tournament as a medalist
5990792 maybe not as a team but who knows if our freshmen continue to shoot the way they have been we have a shot at being competitive
5990793 golf truly is a sport that can be enjoyed by all ages
5990794 we believe that we have selected talented young men who will make the wv blazers very competitive in the aba and who will be excellent role models off the basketball court as well
5990795 we are excited about the upcoming season and we are looking forward to filling the remaining positions on our roster
5990796 i was told that if i didnt sign i could not play
5990797 i knew the 12 50 an hour figure was wrong but signed anyway because i wanted to play
5990798 looks forward to the opportunity to fully litigate the case later this year and will not comment further on the litigation
5990799 because it was so hot everybody was trying to keep cool
5990800 all the big buildings downtown and probably some people in their homes as well were running a lot of air conditioning
5990801 straining the integrated transmission system to operating near its limit
5990802 we have reserves available and procedures in place to meet the electricity demands of all albertans
5990803 the reason investors need to pay attention to the dividend growers outside the tsx 60 is that they have uniformly outperformed their large cap peers within the 60
5990804 there cannot be a dividing line across europe as there was in the time of the cold war
5990805 the future of our relations with russia will depend on the concrete actions russia will take
5990806 as long as russian forces are occupying a part of georgia i cannot see a russia nato council convening
5990807 russia has made it pretty clear its not that anxious to improve co operation with nato so if nato suspends talks thats unlikely to have much leverage
5990808 the view from russia is that international law and international organizations such as nato are transient phenomena of the late 20th century
5990809 what really counts as far as moscow is concerned is big powerful states using their muscle with gas and tanks
5990810 i have always loved sports wanted to play in high school and beyond and now in my senior season i have one more chance to help tazewell have a good year
5990811 matt wants to show people that he is deserving of the confidence wake forest has shown in him
5990812 he wants his teammates to know he can be a force for this team and he wants to carry that on into college
5990813 he has become a leader for us not always vocal but by example he works hard in practice in scrimmages and has shown intensity in games he wants this season to be a success and hes going to do his part to make that happen
5990814 i will give 100 percent on every play im in there
5990815 we have a good lineup going into the regular season our receivers are big we have depth in the backfield and with more depth both ways lots of guys are going to be helping each other
5990816 no matter how we line up in the spread or the power i we dont do anything unless the line opens holes
5990817 our line is the key to our success and i like our chances after watching them work in practice
5990818 jonathan baldwin holds the middle at center and our guards steven barrett and mike elkins flank him with bruiser moore and cameron young at tackles and darrius richmond working with them those guys are dependable and they are the heart of our offense
5990819 matt and i have talked a lot and worked a lot together in the offseason and in practice
5990820 we have practiced our timing plays gotten to know each other and hopefully made ourselves better so we can make this team better
5990821 matt has a lot of ability and for a quarterback it is nice to have a target like that on my side

5990824 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
5990825 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
5990826 a key drug uptake transporter called oatp1a2 involved in shuttling drugs from the small intestine to the bloodstream
5990827 blocking this transporter reduces drug absorption and neutralizes their potential benefits
5990828 by contrast drugs whose levels are boosted in the presence of grapefruit juice appear to block an important drug metabolizing enzyme called cyp3a4 that normally breaks down drugs
5990829 im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
5990830 the first crews arrived within four minutes and found heavy smoke coming from vents in the exterior of the three storey brick building with several people trapped at the windows on the second and third floors
5990831 crews then attempted to enter the building to perform search and rescue and encountered tremendous heat smoke and fire conditions within a few feet of the front door
5990832 a thorough search of the scene will be performed when entry is possible
5990833 we certainly believe that weve made a dent in this group
5990834 no community is immune if theres a market for their product theyll operate there
5990835 thats one thing that we wanted to do that he didnt get to do
5990836 we came to bristol when it was nothing but the concrete pads
5990837 and you could bring a cooler in there the size of a volkswagen if you could get it up the hill the spring race id come with a bikini and a ski suit because i never knew if it was going to be snowing or cold
5990838 things other people can only dream of weve been fortunate enough to do
5990839 we were fortunate to get in down at the pits to enter the garage
5990840 it used to be if you made it to the pits you had it made people get pit passes and theyve got nothing now theyve got to have that garage pass to go with it
5990841 our knee jerk response here the way our company runs we try first to figure out how to say yes to somebody and not try to figure out an excuse why you cant do something
5990842 this is a new request not the first time weve had a request in this area but the first time weve had a specific request like this
5990843 we feel like we have a good enough relationship with the competitors here that i felt pretty confident that somebody would be willing to do this for this family
5990844 i knew that would be impossible particularly at the night race he said he could possibly get a hooters car or a craftsman truck
5990845 hes the defending champion of the hooters pro cup race here last august and he also will be the champion of the hooters north series for this year
5990846 when i talked to him my thinking on this was lets do this early and let you get down to your serious practice after
5990847 the cremains will be in a secure container sealed and itll be securely fastened inside the race car
5990848 the container will be secured with tie wraps and the things necessary to make sure it doesnt get loose in the car cause driver safety is first and foremost important
5990849 he said hooters found out about this and they couldnt believe that somebody would do this
5990850 its a humbling thing to be involved in something that means so much to somebody that they would want to do something like this
5990851 if it means that much to one of your guests you try to do everything in your power to do what they want
5990852 this isnt the first time weve had something like this happen there have been families that have asked us to distribute the remains of a loved one here if this place means that much to a family its an honor to do that for the family generally in most cases i think every family gets a tear in the eye because its fulfillment of something theyve wanted to do
5990853 thats the one thing he wanted and i wanted to see that he had it
5990854 france is resolved to pursue the battle against terrorism for democracy and freedom the cause is just and it is to the credit of france and its armed forces to defend it
5990855 the problem is not the number of soldiers but the mission they are sent on
5990856 this loss of life is absolutely deplorable but also could be anticipated when you have forces that enter an environment where their role is counter insurgency not peacekeeping or reconstruction
5990857 this is the first time a large number of foreign soldiers have been killed in the vicinity of the capital of afghanistan
5990858 last year all the big cities like kabul and kandahar were not under threat
5990859 but this year in kandahar many big attacks have happened
5990860 the taliban announced their intentions at the end of last year to aim to make access to the capital more difficult
5990861 and its strategic purpose is that it grabs a lot more international attention than just some far flung district and it makes life more difficult for ordinary citizens as well as the logistics of the military
5990862 we in canada have understood over the past several years how difficult this mission is
5990863 it is a cause for regret that at a time when we are already in a difficult situation the american side further exacerbates the situation in relations between the united states and russia
5990864 for that reason no one who has good intentions towards us and towards the western world should be afraid of it
5990865 we came here to support jason and what a treat this has been we saw him live at the arena but we wanted the chance to see it again keep the celebration going
5990866 to come out and handle the pressure at his first games the way he did and come out with a silver medal is unbelievable
5990867 we were going crazy in the stands he set the bar so high we knew it would be really difficult for him were just so proud of him
5990868 we knew we were right on track we had faith and were confident about our athletes we were waiting for these medals we knew they were coming
5990869 sappiamo che la stagione estiva una finestra ideale per una pellicola adatta alle famiglie e ancora oggi scontiamo le ripercussioni dello sciopero degli sceneggiatori che ha bloccato gli script di altri progetti cambiando tutto il panorama competitivo del 2009 e allo stesso tempo offrendoci nuove opportunit da cui vorremmo trarre vantaggio
5990870 sharon called him and he showed the caller id to everyone shes really into him and even asked him to come with her to mexico
5990871 the package will create a balance between the powers of the president and the prime minister
5990872 our findings do not support the use of b vitamins as secondary prevention in patients with coronary artery disease
5990873 our position is that we cant recommend the players tour pakistan for the champions trophy obviously we put a position forward a few weeks ago to the icc to that effect but we said we would keep an open mind with the taskforce which we did we heard them speak on friday now we have had a chance to digest it our position hasnt changed
5990874 these findings suggest that it is important children first learn how to calculate answers on their own but after that initial phase using calculators is a fine thing to do even for basic multiplication facts
5990875 the study indicates technology such as calculators can help kids who already have a strong foundation in basic skills
5990876 for students who did not know many multiplication facts generating the answers on their own without a calculator was important and helped their performance on subsequent tests
5990877 but for students who already knew some multiplication facts it didnt matter using a calculator to practice neither helped nor harmed them
5990878 teachers struggle with how to give kids immediate feedback which we know speeds the learning process so another use for calculators is allowing students to use them to check the answers they have come up with by themselves giving them immediate feedback and more time for practice
5990879 loable 56 55 es un gran anticipo al apote sico ltimo p rrafo se masca la tragedia

5990881 barring a big surprise or last minute change of heart the choice is likely to be sen joe biden of delaware chairman of the foreign relations committee
5990882 youve got better things to do guys im not the guy
5990883 the effects appear to be higher than the ones caused by other dietary fibres such as oat fibre or psyllium probably due to the combined effect of dietary fibre and antioxidants
5990884 the study suggests that the critical ingredient in smoking that may be causing emphysema is cadmium a well known contaminant of cigarette smoke
5990885 the worry is if you are exposed to this cadmium through other sources you can also be at risk for emphysema
5990886 with a larger population we will be able to better disentangle the independent effects of cadmium and smoking and whether dietary cadmium or other non cigarette sources may also influence lung function
5990887 vap is a relatively common infection and increasingly one caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria
5990888 there have been many attempts to prevent vap most of which have revolved around modifying hospital practices the silver coated endotracheal tube has an advantage in that it doesnt require any additional effort by nurses therapists and doctors who may already be over burdened
5990889 i think this is just the beginning for this kind of technology the silver polymer coating will most likely be applied also to tracheostomy tubes and also become available for use in pediatric medicine in the future we could see other types of coatings with other functions placed on devices that come into contact with the body
5990890 the situation is really bad because of the flood water our life has gone for a toss not only humans even animals are a troubled lot the level of the water is above the danger level we are somehow living in these boats
5990891 the government has not done much to help us we have helped ourselves the children of the village helped us to place the belongings on the rooftop first but when the water level rose further we have got our belongings here and are sitting here
5990892 we dont have the processes in space to remove excess heat or keep the spacecraft warm in excess cold
5990893 it may sound very trivial but controlling the temperature of a spacecraft is absolutely crucial
5990894 ppp co chairman asif zardari insisted on the minus one formula which is restoration of all sacked judges except iftikhar muhammad chaudhry
5990895 the ppp wanted the reinstatement of judges minus one through a constitutional package but the pml n insisted that they should be all restored through an executive order within three days as agreed already
5990896 the anp and the jui f tacitly endorsed the ppp point of view
5990897 there should be no question in our country of choosing between bear and man
5990898 we must find a balanced means of coexistence on one hand the presence of bears in the pyrenees reflects a willingness to protect biodiversity on the other the support of the local population is essential
5990899 the language is so tough i started taking some chinese lessons after learning french and german after a while i could speak a little and understand a little but all the words characters and pronunciations in mandarin are so different all of them are hard to manage
5990900 mean average plasma total homocysteine concentration was reduced by 30 percent after 1 year of treatment in the groups receiving folic acid and vitamin b12
5990901 we found a numerically lower incidence of stroke and higher incidence of cancer in the groups receiving folic acid but these observations were not statistically significant
5990902 our findings do not support the use of b vitamins as secondary prevention in patients with coronary artery disease
5990903 my book is a respectful portrayal of islam of aisha of muhammad and anyone who reads it with an open mind will come away with an understanding of islam as a peaceful religion
5990904 we felt an obligation to take these concerns very seriously we consulted with security experts as well as with scholars of islam whom we asked to review the book and offer their assessments of potential reactions
5990905 this is the first time that a study provides evidence that in the human brain dopamine is involved in the adaptations that result from sleep deprivation
5990906 these findings suggest dopamine may increase after sleep deprivation as a compensatory response to the effects of increased sleep drive in the brain
5990907 the extent to which this occurs may differentiate how vulnerable people are to the neurobehavioral effects of sleep loss
5990908 however the concurrent decline in cognitive performance which is associated with the dopamine increases suggests that the adaptation is not sufficient to overcome the cognitive deterioration induced by sleep deprivation and may even contribute to it
5990909 magicians have developed powerful cognitive principles and intuitions about attention and awareness that are not understood scientifically weve been able to learn more about cognition from magicians who have developed illusions that trick audiences
5990910 the collaboration on this project has led to many exciting insights to help us understand the brains underlying cognition
5990911 tell me sweetie what is the weather like in england im not used to the cold any more ive got so used to the heat in asia
5990912 im so happy to be going back to england ive been waiting for this day a long long time

5990918 i saw him at christmas and birthdays and he provided money for school clothes and he called occasionally
5990919 the fact that weve never been recognised and then cindy has to put such a fine point on it by saying something thats not true
5990920 jessica went from a size 8 to a size 4 pretty quickly
5990921 the baby always comes first but jessica definitely set goals for herself
5990922 jessica has made amazing progress in a very short time
5990923 the state and the central governments have acted in a partisan manner on amarnath issue bjp demands that the land must be restored to shri amarnath shrine board the separatists should be hauled before law for challenging the sovereignty of the indian republic
5990924 then two seconds later there was a message from nicole wishing us good luck
5990925 i ended up returning her call she was very happy
5990926 she was very surprised that we do have a tradition of naming our boats after her movies and shes just really stoked to be part of a team
5990927 it does go a long way dont worry about that
5990928 the state and the central government both have acted in a partisan manner on shri amarnath issue bjp demands that the land must be restored to shri amarnath shrine board sasb and the separatists should be hauled before law for challenging the sovereignty of the indian republic
5990929 its as i thought nowhere does it demonstrate that you have taken responsibility for anything
5990930 i am in the second netball team and i turn up for matches i think that is responsible of me ill give you that i dont go to all my lessons but im only human you wouldnt go to double german either if you had to put up with that moustachioed one breathing his halitosis all over the place
5990931 the type of responsibility i am talking about is being in charge of other people now remember the time you had to supervise prep for the first year boys
5990932 oh come on now sir that could happen to anyone
5990933 i have never heard a noise like it bedlam and the sheikhs son was wearing your bra i mean you must have noticed that we didnt make you a prefect and i hope you realised why
5990934 i have been considering your strengths and weaknesses and i would like to offer you a position of responsibility for the religious welfare of the house as house sacristan
5990935 sir i am a roman catholic this is a protestant school i dont know anything about protestantism i couldnt do it i mean thank you for thinking i am pious enough but itll have to be a no
5990936 we are anglo catholics here its very high church just like you lot smells and bells pongs and gongs decent vestments latin you know i mean good god girl its all christianity were all singing from the same hymn sheet what
5990937 i baptise you in the name of the father son and holy spirit
5990938 would you say you agree with the devil or do you renounce him and all of his works
5990939 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5990940 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5990941 the us and poland are to sign a deal to locate part of the uss controversial missile defence system on polish soil

5990946 this is the last friendly before the world cup qualifiers and there will not be a lot of experiments but i have the possibility to get to know better some players like emile heskey
5990947 it is the first time ive picked him in the squad
5990948 i dont know where the carr story has come from i can categorically say no to that one
5990949 i keep hearing the brown rumour but theres nothing in it in fact i dont see us doing anything before the transfer window shuts
5990950 i dont know where the carr story has come from i can categorically say no to that one
5990951 i keep hearing the brown rumour but theres nothing in it in fact i dont see us doing anything before the transfer window shuts
5990952 he cant be captain of the team on the bench
5990953 i pick over what ive seen over the last two or three weeks and weve lifted the standard
5990954 now i look on the bench and i see dean sitting there along with carlos edwards michael chopra and anthony stokes
5990955 you cant go into a one day series with your eyes on the game thats in six weeks time
5990956 this series is as important a one day series as any that england play in
5990957 its kevs pietersen first as captain and everyone wants to make a good impression after the way the new zealand series finished and theres no better way to play one of the best teams in the world than on your own turf
5990958 they will want as much assurance as they can possibly get
5990959 i was just trying to make sure i was in a good position keeping an eye on the board and seeing where everyone else was
5990960 im just coming here to win thats the aim for me
5990961 i dont even think about not having a leg and if i want to keep competing i will have to continue to qualify with the able bodied for me its not about the disability at all
5990962 with shanghai stocks rebounding this strongly investors are returning to currency markets
5990963 remain poised to act if slowing growth fails to contain inflationary pressures
5990964 if you ask how the united states is actually performing there is a fear of inflation and if you consider its economic and financial conditions they are unquestionably bad
5990965 there is no valid reason to continue buying the dollar
5990966 i spoke to gianni the other day and watched his game from the other night
5990967 it was great to see a west bromwich albion player playing in such an arena and such a game against such great players
5990968 it was a great atmosphere and there some of the best players in the world on the pitch
5990969 i watched him walk on the pitch alongside lionel messi and riquelme full argentina internationals and great great players
5990970 it was quite special and hopefully the premier league arena will hold no fears for him after playing in games like that
5990971 well have a look at him when he comes back and he could be in contention for saturday
5990972 hes played four games over there so his fitness levels shouldnt be in question
5990973 well see how he is after the journey and ill chat with him when returns
5990974 at this point no one is taking responsibility for which law is holding him there
5990975 now i understand that theres a florida law on fugitives that allows them to give no bond and the florida judge said he wont give bond unless the prosecutor here in arizona says its ok which is not happening
5990976 he will sit in jail until he adjudicates the charges there in miami and then well pick him up
5990977 we are deeply saddened that leroi moore saxophonist and founding member of dave matthews band died unexpectedly tuesday afternoon august 19 2008 at hollywood presbyterian medical center in los angeles from sudden complications stemming from his june atv accident on his farm near charlottesville virginia leroi had recently returned to his los angeles home to begin an intensive physical rehabilitation program
5990978 vedo una dozzina di camion pesanti che hanno cominciato a muoversi per entrare in russia
5990979 this study shows that number abilities are not simply based on culture or language
5990980 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5990981 we need to investigate ways in which we can add on to these building blocks to develop ways of teaching numeracy that are relevant to indigenous students culture
5990982 we also need to redefine the way we think about numeracy across the board moving away from the view that we need words to describe numbers and basic computations
5990983 muxtape will be unavailable for a brief period while we sort out a problem with the riaa
5990984 no artists or labels have complained the site is not closed indefinitely stay tuned
5990985 but now its been more constructed its just going to be called j o n a s and is going to be us dealing with trying to take out the trash and not get hounded by fans its going to be a funny show
5990986 i feel like its better not for us to dwell on that type of thing it could only go wrong
5990987 weve all been playing in bands for a very long time with little or no success depending on how you define that but the fact is that we went into this with only one ambition to have a good time and for us being able to still do that is really all thats important
5990988 we do like the thought of trying to be the best band in america
5990989 i mean who really knows who the best band is i dont thats for sure so for us striving to be really good at what we do and trying to have a good time thats the fun part everything else is just a little beyond us
5990990 on a good night we move more alcohol than most bands do in a week
5990991 when we first started out our audiences were maybe a little reflection of us you know people in their later 20s early 30s and predominately dudes guys who buy records and watch sports and a smattering of angry girlfriends
5990992 i think as the bands audience has grown weve actually expanded younger and there are a lot more girls coming to the shows and a lot of girls making their presence more upfront and thats just amazing
5990993 one of the coolest things i see now is fathers and sons coming to the show together
5990994 were kind of a classic rock band and people who grew up in the 70s and 80s even can probably relate to us as much as a 21 year old kid now theres also a really interesting sense of community with the fans theres a particular group called the unified scene who wear matching t shirts and form these bonds through the shows and i never thought wed see that
5990995 its really exciting to think about where this band has been and where were going
5990996 when we started we wanted to play a show and drink some beer and then last summer we opened for the rolling stones and played glastonbury and we opened for the stooges in croatia this band has really taken us around the world and its allowed all of us to see so much im pretty much amazed on a daily basis
5990997 alterations in brain serotonin levels have been linked to several mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety
5990998 however despite the prevalence of postpartum depression and the frequent use of serotonergic drugs such as prozac and zoloft to treat this disorder a requirement for maternal serotonin function in the mothers behavior toward her offspring had not been convincingly demonstrated until now
5990999 the continuum wireless is designed to produce efficiency and boost throughput in mri but it also builds confidence in the patient care staff that control of a patients medication is always nearby especially when implemented for applications like pediatric sedation

5991002 in my travels round the world i have always been surprised that no matter where i go people recognize and know me from europe australia and india to the philippines and the zulu nation in south africa
5991003 now there is proof that nearly all hospital infections are avoidable when doctors and staff clean their hands and rigorously practice proper hygiene and other preventive measures
5991004 cause the next wave of class action lawsuits bigger than the litigation over asbestos
5991005 numerous lawsuits have been filed against hospitals in florida kentucky and elsewhere by infected patients
5991006 being sued are saying that their infection rates are within national norms
5991007 we have the knowledge to prevent infections whats been lacking is the will
5991008 insurance companies that sell liability coverage to hospitals could change that by offering lower premiums to hospitals that rigorously follow infection prevention protocols
5991009 to be sure lawsuits are not the best way to improve patient care
5991010 many verdicts are unjustified and few truly injured patients find a lawyer to take their case
5991011 coming wave of lawsuits as well as financial incentives from medicare and insurers will fight complacency about hospital hygiene
5991012 may sound frivolous but little else has proven effective for the men most affected by the epidemic
5991013 committed to ensuring that its resources are going to the populations hardest hit by the epidemic
5991014 at a minimum we need to be matching percentages to where the epidemic is
5991015 a very easy population to fund its often more politically viable to fund programs for women and children and youth
5991016 the era of 50 50 is gone the world is not static the current trend all over the world is that people are in control of their resources
5991017 he said uwazuruike who spoke with newsmen in his freedom house okwe imo state
5991018 i say bravo to militants but what i hate to hear is that niger delta leaders are calling for 50 per cent control of their resources no they should call for 100 per cent and pay tax to the government the militants should take a step further to mount pressure on the federal government for their demands
5991019 the traditional artificial hip is based on a mans anatomy women are built differently than men
5991020 women tend to be shorter than men more petite and have smaller bones and shorter hips
5991021 knee implants have been functioning very well for men and women but we wanted to meet womens unique needs by making knee replacements that feel fit and function even better
5991022 the implant is the best of both worlds its based on the current implant we use a highly successful implant with great mechanics and 10 years of clinical success only the shape of this new implant is different to make it feel more natural
5991023 the availability of implants in a wide variety of shapes and sizes will help us provide a more patient specific approach for all patients

5991031 oh no is that what i have in front of me
5991032 weve accomplished so many great things but what if this is it before coming here we were at an event in norway and having so much fun but it just suddenly hit me goodness gracious we both want to have families after this and who knows what happens after that
5991033 theres so much going on but i know how fortunate i am i know how crazy my life is and how lucky i am to have this lifestyle and how im living this life thats way beyond my dreams
5991034 going through hell basically living in hell and leaning on my family the opening ceremonies were great in sydney and i have a lot of friends in australia but other than that the experience was not very positive
5991035 that isnt tough to do but it was so cool to see my mom in action and being so aggressive down there she found a lab found a scientist found a lawyer i would have gone home they told me to go home but she found all these people and didnt sleep and she was like a lioness with her cubs she was just fighting for me and it was so stressful without her and my dad there i would not have played
5991036 athens was just a magical trip our venue was gorgeous friends and family were there we played great and won

5991039 you know it can be taken away at any moment thats why this feels so great beating a great team and a great pitcher
5991040 im jumping up and down in the outfield every time we get an out
5991041 you never want to leave it in the other teams hands
5991042 you want to get that first run and put the pressure on the other side it was big to get that first run today
5991043 against a team like japan you know its going to come down to one pitch one at bat these games are always tight

5991047 so far a lot of experiments have been carried out with optical techniques that are sometimes difficult to integrate in a complete system the new nanostructures we envisage will make it possible for us to miniaturize systems even further and to develop commercially feasible equipment
5991048 within a second it can take a measurement and tell you whether or not its cancer
5991049 and you can move the probe around quickly to different spots of the skin
5991050 it can tell if the structures of the cells and the biochemicals present are associated with the progression of these cancers
5991051 many biopsies and surgeries would be unnecessary if you had a device that could catch the cancer earlier and identify the margins of where it exists
5991052 like coach franklin says every day we have a major problem we have two great quarterbacks and dont know whos going to pull ahead of one another
5991053 when you compare the faces and head shapes of children with specific types of autism to other children it is obvious there are variations currently autism diagnosis is purely behavior based and doctors use tape measurements to check for facial and brain dissimilarities we are developing a quantitative method that will accurately measure these differences and allow for earlier more precise detection of specific types of the disorder
5991054 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
5991055 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualize and make comparisons
5991056 using the 3 d representations we are comparing the brain structures of autistic children to those of non autistic children no one has ever done that
5991057 our research group is exploiting a tremendous overlap of knowledge from many disciplines yes work will be a pivotal part of anrgs grand scheme
5991058 to solve these problems it takes an entire community of specialists working together
5991059 absolutely make sure our team understands hard work but that they have fun playing football if you are not careful as a coach you can take the fun out of this game
5991060 la hausse des salaires reste contenue certains indicateurs des anticipations inflationnistes ont reflu en juillet

5991063 where access is freely available to all use of electronic media is at least equal to other methods of delivering information or making it available to investors and the market
5991064 availability of information in electronic form whether on edgar or a company web site is the superior method of providing company information to most investors as compared to other methods
5991065 focus on 1 the manner in which information is posted on a company web site and 2 the timely and ready accessibility of such information to investors and the markets
5991066 companies that are well followed by the market and the media may know that the market and the media will pick up and further distribute the disclosures they make on their web sites on the other hand companies with less of a market following which may include many companies with smaller market capitalizations may need to take more affirmative steps so that investors and others know that information is or has been posted on the companys web site and that they should look at the company web site for current information about the company
5991067 we do not believe however that it is necessary that push technology be used in order for the information to be disseminated although that may be one factor to consider in evaluating the accessibility to the information
5991068 some factors though certainly non exclusive ones for companies to consider in evaluating whether their company web site is a recognized channel of distribution and whether the company information on such site is
5991069 we acknowledge the utility these interactive web site features afford companies and shareholders alike and want to promote their growth as important means for companies to maintain a dialogue with their various constituencies
5991070 a company is not responsible for the statements that third parties post on a web site the company sponsors nor is a company obligated to respond to or correct misstatements made by third parties the company remains responsible for its own statements made including statements made on its behalf in a blog or a forum
5991071 companies will be able to save considerable amounts of money in bypassing those wire services

5991076 theres a ton of folks out there trying to compete on multiple dimensions

5991087 president musharraf has been a friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5991088 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability
5991089 the united states will help with these efforts to see pakistan reach its goal of becoming a stable prosperous democratic modern muslim nation
5991090 there is a great deal of frustration on the part of the u s government with pakistans inability to follow through on what the u s sees as its clear commitments
5991091 it remains very much to be seen whether this new democratically elected leadership will really be able to follow through in a sustained and coherent way
5991092 it could actually be setting the torch to the kindling inside the country
5991093 i dont want the people of pakistan to slide deeper and deeper into uncertainty
5991094 it puts a lot more responsibility squarely on the government there is no more excuse any more they have to stand up and do things they cant blame musharraf
5991095 i really dont think he has been a factor for six months
5991096 he hasnt been able to do that while he was in the presidency and he wont be as well positioned out of the presidency to interfere
5991097 strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror
5991098 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges they face
5991099 with a guy he can connect with dads in a different kind of way

5991126 ubuntu has a huge user base and substantial community support around the world we think the passion these users have for linux and the open source movement generally will be important in helping the linux foundation to accelerate the uptake of linux in organizations of all size
5991127 so it seemed logical for us to join the other major vendors supporting the linux foundation at this time
5991128 even though canonical and ubuntu have been participating in our activities for the last few years the direct association with them means well have closer coordination across their organization it also means they see enough value in what we do to financially support it
5991129 we are excited to see the on screen chemistry and emotion this incredibly talented husband and wife team will bring to our show

5991146 the music industry is all done for profit and not for any degree of musical feeling or sentiment
5991147 unfortunately the press distort things to such a degree that youve not got a hope of knowing what the truth is so its not something that i want to participate in or fuel any more

5991155 cbs asked us whos at the top of your dream list
5991156 without hesitation we said laurence fishburne he is a powerful and intense actor with an incredible range we had the opportunity to see mr fishburne in thurgood on broadway a few weeks ago and it was a truly profound experience the actor disappeared and thurgood marshall was standing there on the stage mr fishburne is also a talented writer and director if you distill csi down to its essence its a collaborationand we are so looking forward to collaborating with mr fishburne for all of us at csi this is truly a dream
5991157 i am elated and delighted to be joining the cast of csi i look forward to a wonderful collaboration with the creative and talented team of such a successful and distinguished show
5991158 the most important thing for me to remember is not to mistake my presence for the event
5991159 the event is the show the event is csi everyone has a responsibility to bring their unique talents and gifts to it and thats what im going to do im going to enter into this with the most positive attitude i can im coming to work with people who are wonderful who have made great television for nine years thats a gift all i can say is that im ready to play
5991160 fishburne will play a former pathologist who is now working as an itinerant college lecturer teaching a course in criminalistics his focus is on understanding criminal behavior how and why people commit acts of violence tendencies he disturbingly sees within himself
5991161 i think it was misreported a little bit in terms of this character having the genetic profile of a serial killer
5991162 in reality there is no such thing from the outset what we really wanted to play with in a dramatic sense is a character who has been able to examine his own genetic profile to a certain extent and find certain complexes and certain clusters of biological facts that he has in common with that is associated with aggressive or criminal behavior thats all it is obviously thats a mouthful its not as simple as saying the genetic profile of a serial killer but its just one of those things thats going to lead this character to interested in the world of violent criminals and criminalistics and forensics its what draws him to it the sense that if you find within yourself certain tendencies and see certain behaviors it lets you wonder how these things turn into murder how they turn into violence how they turn into criminal behavior thats all it is its an underlying element for the character its nothing as simple as hes got the genes of a serial killer because theres no such thing
5991163 we had talked about a particular genetic syndrome xyy at an early stage of our story development process
5991164 weve always strived to make sure that csi is as accurate as possible we have a small army of researchers and forensic consultants who work with us our initial steps into figuring out what that particular genetic syndrome was about was not really borne out by the research we changed that aspect of it a little bit but again this is a character still in development thats just the natural course of thing
5991165 let me just say that i have no knowledge of such biological profile nor would i be at liberty to speak about such biological profile if in fact such biological profile exists i dont know im just really excited that im going to be joining this team we have a lot of stuff to work out our last question was what is this characters name we have a lot of stuff to flesh out weve only had an opportunity to sit down with each other face to face one time i think over the next couple weeks well get cracking and really discover what the answers to those questions are all this stuff is discovery for everyone involved
5991166 i wouldnt say my going into weekly television series is actually stepping away from anything
5991167 its another medium in which to work as an actor because i havent done series television since pee wees playhouse its a welcome change its going to be challenging its going to be fun and its going to be exciting
5991168 to be perfectly frank i said to naren and carol mendelsohn when we met here in new york that i felt a little stupid and embarrassed that i hadnt watched the show prior to having a meeting with them but im happy to say that the episodes they sent me to look at were really engaging and really wonderful and kind of dark and moody like a lot of the work ive been involved in and i thought wow thats cool hmmm wow thisll work so im very excited
5991169 were a show that spends a lot of time thinking we dont blow stuff up were not about chasing people down and shooting people and the quality we were looking for was deep intelligence mr fishburne when you look at his work hes always brought that sensibility to the material hes done it was a perfect fit for csi
5991170 mr carter said he is relatively happy with the outcome as he hadnt wanted the officer sacked however he is still pursuing compensation from the force
5991171 is the fact that the officer farooq filed a written complaint and charges against this man
5991172 they dont have the ability to do this sort of thing again
5991173 de hecho es m s fuerte de lo que hab a sido hasta ahora

5991187 i really love to engage youth in intelligent conversations about values ideals and goals many of the questions in the kubit2me games get these ideas out in the open
5991188 as a working mother of preteen and teenage boys its a challenge to find the time to have meaningful conversations with my kids and more of a challenge to get them to open up
5991189 when we played kubit2me now youre talkin we all really listened to each other not only did we have a blast playing this game but we also learned some interesting things about each other

5991219 the pacific islands forum also has expectations about good governance
5991220 it has expectations that fiji will keep its word and what weve heard rippling out of fiji over the last day or two is that fiji not only doesnt intend coming to this meeting but it is starting to float the possibility that they might leave the forum altogether
5991221 its refused to do that and instead has started floating that it could leave altogether
5991222 the relationship between the forum and fiji is very frosty because people feel let down
5991223 no one has contemplated economic sanctions because they dont work unless applied by the united nations and universally adhered to
5991224 this community will be discussing what measures will be taken in response to the contempt for democracy that has been reflected in the position by bainimarama
5991225 i think this is a direct and deliberate slight and snub to the leaders of the pacific island countries assembled here in niue we will be discussing today and tomorrow the forum countries reaction to that
5991226 the challenge for us in these meetings is to uphold and stand firmly behind that principle of democracy

5991230 ready steady move lessons promote the vital mind body connection in childrens brains stimulating both right and left side brain functions for increased learning abilities along with better physical health
5991231 comprehension is immediate and long lasting because this type of learning creates more neural networks in the childs brain
5991232 another reason is that its simply more fun just watch children in a ready steady move lesson
5991233 in hungary like elsewhere children spend too much time watching television or sitting in front of a computer also because of the reduction in phys ed lessons in schools parents are enthused about enrolling their children in a fun all inclusive movement class that also helps them practice english
5991234 we plan to run ready steady move in budapest and the larger cities the first year with a projected target of 1000 2000 children hopefully doubling or even tripling that number in the coming year

5991248 budgeting may not sound exciting but it is the no 1 sure fire way to save money
5991249 the key is to set goals with your spouse and children whether the goal is to save on weekly grocery bills save for a vacation next summer or save for kids education write down the goals and build your budget with the goals in mind that will dictate month to month expenditures and take the guesswork out of what you can spend for back to school items
5991250 we all know this but putting it into action takes thought and planning
5991251 in other words if you are used to making a day of back to school shopping think twice skip the lunch out just shop and go home
5991252 or reward the kids for their shopping patience with a picnic and playtime at a park you will all be more motivated to get the shopping done
5991253 buying only what you need is the best way to curb spending
5991254 moreover building a budget and not spending beyond your means is the best primer for personal finance that you can give your family and yourself

5991285 im getting calls from middle east e gaming development industry executives investors and general employees all asking about what is going on and if they can provide information for the news agency of course they want their names mentioned so that a little publicity is given to their particular middle east e gaming development company but it does save me from hunting these people down and taking interviews

5991302 we needed to make newness out of something that was not terribly new
5991303 lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
5991304 while we accept that constraints on runway capacity in the south east will limit the scope for the benefits of competition in the short term we believe that separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
5991305 just as the government is about to make the decisions that could lead to the first full length runways being built in the south east since the second world war the commission risks creating uncertainty delay and confusion at exactly the wrong time
5991306 in scotland the commission has apparently ignored the evidence presented by baa and supported by numerous respected third party organisations that clearly demonstrates that serve separate markets and therefore do not and would not compete regardless of ownership

5991313 we can model the economy and show that by 2035 it china will be as big if not bigger than the united states economy will be at that time and by the middle of the century it will be twice the size of the u s economy at that time
5991314 whats happening right now is the world is moving beyond america the future is in many ways being shaped in distant places by foreign people
5991315 thats a big shift from a world in which america was at the center economically financially culturally militarily politically to a world in which there are more centers and many forces from india to china to brazil to south africa that have to be taken into account
5991316 this is not happening because america is failing or declining

5991319 we need to change our tax policies change our immigration policy we made the u s a magnet an attractive place for the best and the brightest in the world and we frustrate that by saying you get a ph d here and that doesnt matter right now were throwing you out thats very self destructive behavior

5991349 one day in his 27th year while on his way to work as a clerk in the electricity department he climbed the rathinagiri hill to offer his prayers there was neither camphor nor incense available at the poor and delapitated temple he walked around the shrine with a heavy heart and was suddenly overcome with divine awakening he fell in a faint to the ground and on waking up was unable to remember his own self he dressed himself in a loincloth he took a sacred vow not to leave until the temple was restored to its former glory
5991350 for him to come out and play like that i hope hes nervous as hell friday
5991351 give me a couple of hours and itll probably smack me in the face thats the coolest thing about it we still want the gold medal but if we lose were going home with the silver were going home with some kind of medal
5991352 but losing the first match ended up helping us out otherwise we would have played brazil to get into the semifinals instead they put us on the top bracket with no brazilian teams we had a pretty easy road to the gold medal match
5991353 this just means we did what we set out to do
5991354 we still have one more match remaining to put the crowning achievement for probably our careers its fantastic to get there but the final goal is to get the gold medal if we dont get that ive still had a great time but ill be disappointed
5991355 but we all got fired up by that press conference

5991361 weve played brazil before and we know theyre a pretty awesome team with a lot of great personalities but this team player for player is unified and strong and were together were looking forward to it
5991362 we thought youd be embracing the fact that we had so many goal scorers on this team not ignoring it

5991387 conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the sixties and seventies the peak of industrial activity in europe and north america and certainly before implementation of clean air act controls in the early 1970s
5991388 but it turns out pollution in southern greenland was higher 100 years ago when north american and european economies ran on coal before the advent of cleaner more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas based economies
5991389 contamination of other sectors may be increasing because of the rapid coal driven growth of asian economies

5991409 unlikely to require the divestiture of heathrow unless the sale of gatwick or stansted is likely to be impractical or ineffective
5991410 aspects of government policy restrict or distort competition by contributing to the current capacity constraints at baas london airports
5991411 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying the delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
5991412 separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
5991413 we have provisionally found that there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports
5991414 this is evident from a large number of factors including its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
5991415 this has resulted in investment that is not tailored to the requirements of airport users and lower levels and quality of service for both airlines and passengers
5991416 we have also provisionally found that there are competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
5991417 while we accept that constraints on runway capacity in the south east will limit the scope for the benefits of competition in the short term we believe that separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
5991418 over time we would expect these to increase significantly in scotland where there are no similar capacity constraints we believe separate owners of edinburgh and glasgow would similarly improve their offerings
5991419 baa has argued to us that there is no scope for competition to develop so long as there are capacity constraints we take the opposite view unless the market is opened up to competition there is a serious risk that the current capacity constraints will persist certainly for longer than in a better functioning market
5991420 the earliest new runway capacity will become available is 2015 at stansted with no additional runway capacity possible at heathrow before 2020
5991421 while we accept that government policy and the planning regime have contributed to the lack of capacity we have found that baa as the owner and operator of these london airports has played a major role in not pressing for more capacity sooner and in planning terminal and runway capacity on a conservative and sequential process such that its plans for one airport have been influenced by its plans elsewhere we accept however that baa has been more successful in undertaking several smaller projects simultaneously
5991422 in scotland baa has until recently been noticeably slow to develop new routes at glasgow and edinburgh while at aberdeen its investment plans are regarded as unambitious despite relatively high levels of profitability at southampton it has shown a reluctance to respond to its customers demands
5991423 by the differences in approach to both airline customers and development between baa and owners and operators of regional airports
5991424 we have identified significant competition between several pairs of such airports with benefits which include lower charges development of new routes and a far greater responsiveness to customers in terms of capacity development we note that both manchester and london city airports have expanded successfully without explicit government support
5991425 in regard to regulation we have found that the civil aviation authority caa is constrained by the current statutory framework and that consideration needs to be given to bring it closer into line with those of other sectoral regulators such as energy water and telecommunications with better defined duties objectives and powers including the protection of the interests of consumers the promotion of competition and the ability to impose economic licence conditions
5991426 there is also scope for the caa to play a more active role in facilitating agreement between baa and the airlines by ensuring an appropriate framework for consultation which is currently seriously lacking
5991427 the significant problems in the baa airports market will not be solved overnight and changes in ownership would only be a first step in freeing up the market and providing greater scope for more flexible development
5991428 changes to regulation may similarly be important and there could be benefits available from a less prescriptive government policy on airport capacity development though we recognise decisions on such policies which are wholly for government will be taken in a broader decision framework
5991429 the commissions findings should be assessed in the light of the urgent need for new airport capacity and a modern regulatory framework as well as the need which we recognise for improved service from the airport operator
5991430 the findings state that the lack of runway capacity is a main reason for what it calls the current poor standards of service and the lack of resilience at times of disruption which results in regular delays
5991431 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying the delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
5991432 we will be seeking urgent clarification from the government of how it believes this reports findings can be reconciled with the air transport policy it established in 2003 and its current review of economic regulation
5991433 we note however that this is not the end of the competition commission process and we will continue to point out to the commission the many areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies would be disproportionate and counter productive
5991434 just as the government is about to make the decisions that could lead to the first full length runways being built in the south east since the second world war the commission risks creating uncertainty delay and confusion at exactly the wrong time
5991435 in scotland the commission has apparently ignored the evidence presented by baa and supported by numerous respected third party organisations that clearly demonstrates that edinburgh and glasgow airports serve separate markets and therefore do not and would not compete regardless of ownership

5991464 with refining capacity along the upper texas coast continuing to expand t o p s offers a comprehensive solution for ensuring reliable access to supplies of crude oil
5991465 this project should provide refiners with cost savings operating efficiencies and access to additional supplies beyond the gulf coast region
5991466 the market is oversupplied by at least 1 million barrels a day if opec would like to remove this additional oil out of the market then opec has to cut some production
5991467 its notable that suddenly with output rising opec officials are concerned about adherence to quotas and oversupply
5991468 the worsening economic outlook suggests that oil prices have further to fall but opec whose members are due to meet in early september may act to prevent them from falling too far
5991469 playing in the fifa world cup is an ambition shared by the entire nation and were looking forward to a full house and vocal support from queenslanders to help the players on the journey to south africa
5991470 we will have to work hard to achieve qualification but playing in the fifa world cup is something every player wants to do and they know what they need to do to get there
5991471 i was just trying to make sure i was in a good position keeping an eye on the board and seeing where everyone else was
5991472 im just coming here to win thats the aim for me
5991473 i dont even think about not having a leg and if i want to keep competing i will have to continue to qualify with the able bodied for me its not about the disability at all
5991474 you should not have to put up with this any more and i am sick of it
5991475 they earn 13 000 less than their school colleagues that is unsustainable
5991476 unless we get that resolved before the end of the year we will see tafe teachers leaving in their droves to teach in secondary schools or to go back to industry
5991477 our students earn more than some of us such as students from the army that are paid 60 000 a year to study
5991478 we acknowledge tafe teachers want to maintain the equivalent pay they have had in the past with schoolteachers and think thats a reasonable request
5991479 at the same time the union needs to put on the table productivity increases and mount a case so we can substantiate that to government

5991485 all who are involved will get gods wrath and curse and will be put in hell forever
5991486 but i was wondering why those who kill over 200 people are afraid of facing the death penalty themselves
5991487 i think if we have a review of the status of the death penalty we have to review the overall system of punishment because we dont want to see for example someone who is involved in a serious murder be freed before the age of 50 or below 50 and continue to be a problem for the society
5991488 the possibility of the death penalty being abolished has to be balanced with a more adequate system of punishment
5991489 it is not offensive per se for women to be topless it may be distasteful to some but in my view the council reference to offensive cannot reasonably apply in these circumstances

5991491 ubuntu has a huge user base and substantial community support around the world we think the passion these users have for linux and the open source movement generally will be important in helping the linux foundation to accelerate the uptake of linux in organizations of all size
5991492 so it seemed logical for us to join the other major vendors supporting the linux foundation at this time
5991493 even though canonical and ubuntu have been participating in our activities for the last few years the direct association with them means well have closer coordination across their organization it also means they see enough value in what we do to financially support it

5991517 we will have to repatriate him back to vietnam because he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter
5991518 he could be returned to his homeland since we do not want him here
5991519 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
5991520 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5991521 we dont feel its appropriate he spends his time hopping from one country to the next one while countries decide what to do with him
5991522 when our american friends tell us its the middle east which is the most likely area of proliferation and nuclear chemical and biological weapons theyre not
5991523 its asia that has the most potent latent capabilities to develop nuclear chemical and biological weapons
5991524 thats because of the advance of their economies and industrial base
5991525 japan goes nuclear only if it loses confidence in the american alliance
5991526 and if japan develops a nuclear weapon china would immediately proliferate a number of ballistic missiles and warheads and whats the betting south korea would develop a nuclear weapon

5991535 i think a lot of younger kids really incline themselves to drink because its illegal they are wanting to try something they are not allowed if you lowered it maybe it would not be such a sought after thing to do

5991542 the market has been pacing up and down at low levels for a long time investors have all been waiting for a chance

5991547 we are hopeful that usepa will carefully examine this information and respond accordingly

5991554 there could be further upside but it will not be that much because of the poor economic outlook in the west
5991555 that is why we wont see prices falling below 112 a barrel

5991558 its one of those things you feel like youre letting them down
5991559 i just want to go out there and try and work hard the rest of the season for them
5991560 we worked on that at the start of the year
5991561 we sat down and looked at the tackle on cross and there wasnt much more i could do
5991562 i tackled low and fell backwards and he went over me
5991563 its just one of those things i wont change my tackling technique
5991564 i thought it the suspension was pretty harsh but im pretty happy with the way he has been training
5991565 hes an imposing figure and not too many blokes like to run straight at him his presence in the line up is a huge boost to the players around him
5991566 its going to be a tough game they are coming off a loss and they are always hard to beat there and the game is just as crucial to them as it is to us
5991567 they come with big game experience they are all players in internationals and state of origin so you hope they bring that sort of attitude

5991572 the olympics in beijing is going to be so different to london and the beauty is in the contrast
5991573 i think the beijing games could end up being unique im not sure how many other countries would have either the resources or the control of the resources to be able to put them behind an event like this
5991574 i think other than north korea and china no other country can achieve this in the world
5991575 i have conducted operas in the west it was so troublesome they only work four and a half days each week every day there are two coffee breaks and no overtime work at all there cannot be any discomfort because of human rights this can really worry me to death
5991576 we have all seen what the chinese have done it has been fantastic but i am not intimidated by that we can have a show that is equally as fantastic without wasting money
5991577 i am not convinced that there arent still some sensible savings we can make without remotely prejudicing our ability to deliver a fantastic games
5991578 would not give rise to any competition concerns in the markets concerned
5991579 on questions of individual school decisions thats a matter for the school involved nationally what do we want to see we want to see a high quality national curriculum
5991580 im not going to lecture school leaders about the decisions they make in their individual school but from the point of view of the national government what we want to see is rising standards we want to see educational excellence
5991581 we want a new era of transparency when it comes to whats happening in schools we want information publicly available about the students in our schools about the mix of abilities that they bring to school and we want more information available publicly about attainment in schools
5991582 the commissions findings state that the lack of runway capacity is a main reason for what it calls the current poor standards of service and the lack of resilience at times of disruption which results in regular delays
5991583 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa the commission risks delaying
5991584 comprehensive report into the market power of the baa monopoly and fully endorse its findings
5991585 competition works monopolies dont baas monopoly control over the london airports has been highly detrimental to competition and consumers
5991586 baa has long ignored the needs of its airline users and the travelling public and provided inefficient gold plated facilities encouraged by an ineffectual regulator the civil aviation authority
5991587 focus must be on ensuring that the current regulation of baas london airports is strengthened
5991588 the competition commission has provisionally found that there are competition problems at each of baas seven uk airports heathrow gatwick stansted and southampton in england and edinburgh glasgow and aberdeen in scotland with adverse consequences for passengers and airlines
5991589 a principal cause is their common ownership by baa there are also competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
5991590 the cc is now seeking views on which two of baas three london airports should be sold and similarly which of edinburgh or glasgow airports should be sold
5991591 there is still a chance that we could win the tri nations and we want to go out there and play positive rugby
5991592 we want to play our best another loss would be unacceptable
5991593 weve been looking over one or two things and already ive seen a few improvements at training
5991594 playing for the boks is all about pride so i dont know if you can say we are just playing for pride this weekend
5991595 schalk has always won a lot of ball for us in the past
5991596 but we do need to be more accurate at the breakdown situation
5991597 all the countries have been invited after each match to put a report forward on every referee where they have got concerns
5991598 countries like england wales argentina and many others have all spent time after games submitting very mature reports that is very valuable to us
5991599 however i have yet to hear from the south africans all season
5991600 weve got a lot of young blokes in there a lot of first year players and first game players so to get a win for them would be great and to sing the club song would be really good
5991601 to get some real positives out of the season these last two games it would be good to win both
5991602 we havent really thought about it much well just treat them as even a top eight side theyre going along alright and we just want to see how we go against a team that we think we should beat
5991603 dean knows a fair bit about the insides and everything that works at the club but we know he has a certain style as well so it works both ways and hopefully the players come out on top on the day
5991604 well go out with the same sort of style weve had all year
5991605 i certainly dont want to be a passenger i want to get out there and really be involved
5991606 i want to have an impact for me i like having ball in hand and attacking with it so if i can do that then i will be happy
5991607 i played in 2005 a fair bit and then none in 2006 so certainly the confidence took a bit of a hit
5991608 but to be able to come back in 2007 and especially at the world cup and perform at the biggest stage i came away with a lot of confidence and took that into the super 14
5991609 at the same time it means nothing if you dont continue on with it so it is just seeking that consistency which i guess has eluded me somewhat in the early stages of my career
5991610 the times you play well but you back it up with a game thats not so good it is an experience you can come away with and look at perhaps why that happened
5991611 i am starting to play a few games here and there now and i have certainly learnt along the way and seeking that consistency even more so week to week
5991612 he had a significant injury and hes now got a significant volume of work behind him both in game and out of game so im expecting hes ready to start flying
5991613 we have our structures there but if you see an opportunity you are encouraged to take it it is something i am encouraged about being involved in
5991614 the fact that theyre out here and doing it is good it means theres a chance but the key will be how they report after that
5991615 wir sind froh den eingeschlagenen weg fortsetzen zu k nnen da wir uns mit diesem auftrag quasi vor unserer haust r auch f r weitere projekte empfehlen k nnen

5991619 all the cheap stuff out there is getting scooped up by people
5991620 i think the same kind of places would have been right around 600 000 for one bedroom one bath loft condos
5991621 it was a waiting game for those to come down to my price range
5991622 values have dropped to a point where investors are coming in and buying those properties because they can get positive cash flow now
5991623 traditionally we have a little bump after labor day but weve had a bump in summertime and we have these reos coming online every day

5991631 it has very limited options and is more limited by the day which is unfortunate considering all the money they are putting into it
5991632 despite the turmoil in the industry we will complete the modernization of our airport
5991633 this is the worst financial crisis in commercial aviation history
5991634 in the future we can expect to see more airlines fail and passengers will see higher fares
5991635 it is a good economic measure and it shows that we are trying to move forward together
5991636 they tend to want to fly in and out of the same airport because it just becomes a habit there is cumulative impact on san jose that is severe

5991659 weve definitely been excited about the growth and embrace of technology by both voters and candidates
5991660 its been explosive its light years from 2004 youtube didnt exist four years ago and now it is being heavily used for politics
5991661 google is attempting to expand its influence over the political process to help it achieve its commercial goals
5991662 google likes to bask in self congratulatory rhetoric claiming it has the publics interests at heart its all about accessing peoples data for targeted marketing
5991663 in this us election year what information could be more important than the candidates own words to describe their views actions and platforms
5991664 as idealistic as that sounds is as idealistic as we are it is exciting all around not just for google
5991665 this new politics is disruptive upsetting old arrangements and displacing people invested in the old ways
5991666 it is literally crashing the gate of the old system
5991667 van elke winkel kon het personeel een andere baan krijgen of zal het een andere baan krijgen ofwel bij de overnemer ofwel in de andere winkels
5991668 in deze tijden van dalende koopkracht zullen we evolueren naar het outlet concept door onze collecties van de vorige jaren te verkopen
5991669 de federatieraad is bereid het onafhankelijke statuut van zuid osseti en abchazi te erkennen als de mensen in die regios dit wensen en als een besluit in die richting genomen wordt door de russische president
5991670 er is dus werk aan de winkel op de werkvloer en bij het rekruteren
5991671 het zijn niet alleen de jobinhoud en het loon maar ook de sfeer in een bedrijf die maken of iemand gelukkig is in zijn of haar job bedrijven vinden al moeilijk de juiste medewerkers ze kunnen dan ook beter hun best doen om het werk zo aangenaam mogelijk te maken om te vermijden dat hun werknemers van job gaan veranderen
5991672 burgemeester guy co me verklaarde gisteren op een persconferentie dat de voorzitter van rs waremmien zijn functie als beheerder van het stadion niet meer kon uitoefenen hij voegde eraan toe dat indien hij geen ontslag nam de stad de aangekondigde investeringen voor het gemeentelijke stadion zou bevriezen
5991673 ik had me aan die stellingname van guy co me verwacht en ik zal de zaak niet polemiseren zoals ik aankondigde vertrek ik van zodra ik een rem ben dat is het geval dus trek ik me terug als voorzitter
5991674 weve got a lot of young blokes in there a lot of first year players and first game players so to get a win for them would be great and to sing the club song would be really good
5991675 to get some real positives out of the season these last two games it would be good to win both
5991676 we havent really thought about it much well just treat them as even a top eight side theyre going along alright and we just want to see how we go against a team that we think we should beat
5991677 dean knows a fair bit about the insides and everything that works at the club but we know he has a certain style as well so it works both ways and hopefully the players come out on top on the day
5991678 well go out with the same sort of style weve had all year
5991679 the commissions findings state that the lack of runway capacity is a main reason for what it calls the current poor standards of service and the lack of resilience at times of disruption which results in regular delays
5991680 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa the commission risks delaying
5991681 comprehensive report into the market power of the baa monopoly and fully endorse its findings
5991682 competition works monopolies dont baas monopoly control over the london airports has been highly detrimental to competition and consumers
5991683 baa has long ignored the needs of its airline users and the travelling public and provided inefficient gold plated facilities encouraged by an ineffectual regulator the civil aviation authority
5991684 focus must be on ensuring that the current regulation of baas london airports is strengthened
5991685 the competition commission has provisionally found that there are competition problems at each of baas seven uk airports heathrow gatwick stansted and southampton in england and edinburgh glasgow and aberdeen in scotland with adverse consequences for passengers and airlines
5991686 a principal cause is their common ownership by baa there are also competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
5991687 the cc is now seeking views on which two of baas three london airports should be sold and similarly which of edinburgh or glasgow airports should be sold
5991688 i certainly dont want to be a passenger i want to get out there and really be involved
5991689 i want to have an impact for me i like having ball in hand and attacking with it so if i can do that then i will be happy
5991690 i played in 2005 a fair bit and then none in 2006 so certainly the confidence took a bit of a hit
5991691 but to be able to come back in 2007 and especially at the world cup and perform at the biggest stage i came away with a lot of confidence and took that into the super 14
5991692 at the same time it means nothing if you dont continue on with it so it is just seeking that consistency which i guess has eluded me somewhat in the early stages of my career
5991693 the times you play well but you back it up with a game thats not so good it is an experience you can come away with and look at perhaps why that happened
5991694 i am starting to play a few games here and there now and i have certainly learnt along the way and seeking that consistency even more so week to week
5991695 he had a significant injury and hes now got a significant volume of work behind him both in game and out of game so im expecting hes ready to start flying
5991696 we have our structures there but if you see an opportunity you are encouraged to take it it is something i am encouraged about being involved in
5991697 the fact that theyre out here and doing it is good it means theres a chance but the key will be how they report after that
5991698 there is still a chance that we could win the tri nations and we want to go out there and play positive rugby
5991699 we want to play our best another loss would be unacceptable
5991700 weve been looking over one or two things and already ive seen a few improvements at training
5991701 playing for the boks is all about pride so i dont know if you can say we are just playing for pride this weekend
5991702 schalk has always won a lot of ball for us in the past
5991703 but we do need to be more accurate at the breakdown situation
5991704 all the countries have been invited after each match to put a report forward on every referee where they have got concerns
5991705 countries like england wales argentina and many others have all spent time after games submitting very mature reports that is very valuable to us
5991706 however i have yet to hear from the south africans all season there is a medium to go through and that is me but i have no sympathy for a coach that wants to go through the media rather than me
5991707 i will be meeting peter de villiers later in the month and if he has any grievances he will have a chance to bring them to me
5991708 at this moment thaksins legal team is proceeding to ask for political asylum for thaksin and his family in britain
5991709 his asylum request will note their malicious treatment in thailand where they lack security and freedom
5991710 playing in the fifa world cup is an ambition shared by the entire nation and were looking forward to a full house and vocal support from queenslanders to help the players on the journey to south africa
5991711 we will have to work hard to achieve qualification but playing in the fifa world cup is something every player wants to do and they know what they need to do to get there
5991712 weve definitely been excited about the growth and embrace of technology by both voters and candidates
5991713 its been explosive its light years from 2004 youtube didnt exist four years ago and now it is being heavily used for politics

5991724 internally we recognized that our discerning customers both individuals as well as commercial establishments would appreciate a music system that would offer the same exceptional sound quality as the model d music system but would be ideal for more intimate listening spaces
5991725 reflects the organisations lack of sincerity to push for a successful conclusion of the peace process
5991726 the president detests the milf leaderships lack of control over its so called base commands
5991727 this excuse has been abused for too long and the president now draws the line
5991728 to attain these objectives every arsenal at the disposal of the armed forces and the police will be utilised without let up
5991729 but we are optimistic we can still save the peace process this can be the beginning of war if not properly handled but there is still a chance of going back to peace
5991730 from our side we are trying our best to restrain our commanders
5991731 the first thing we have done is to restrain them from further initiating military movements
5991732 if the government declares an all out war we will do the same
5991733 i see about a dozen heavy trucks which have started moving out into russia
5991734 we often hear of complaints from patients on the poor service at hospitals both in rural and urban areas
5991735 this happens because some of us have a negative attitude poor communication skills and lack of respect for them this is not good
5991736 patients have different needs this can be complex and sophisticated
5991737 the three year training for your diploma only gives you basic knowledge in this field it is my hope that all of you would pursue advanced courses in specific fields
5991738 ringtones have become such personal statements that a specially created condom ringtone seemed just the right way of combining a practical message with a fun approach we have always had a strong interactive response led component in this ongoing campaign this downloadable ringtone provides an opportunity for our audience to translate a message into an action the idea is to tackle the inhibitions and taboos that can be associated with condoms

5991740 contrary to expectations there hasnt been any dramatic move to downbeat macro economic factors on compensation
5991741 instead companies are looking at innovative ways to cut other cost like travel and recreation without compromising on employee salaries or learning and development this is a healthy sign of a growing and mature economy the war for talent is not over and the current blip is transient hence organisations realise that they have to manage the talent supply for the long term and not the downturn
5991742 unmineable coal seams will be a major way that co2 is sequestered since there is a large capacity for coal seams to accommodate co2 across the nation and because coal seams are situated near to major users such as power plants and coke making ovens
5991743 today we begin the process of demonstrating to the nation that coal seams can realize this potential
5991744 if congress does not pass mandatory control legislation the epa will control emissions through regulation
5991745 most interested parties would prefer that congress rather than the epa perform the regulatory function and for these reasons it is now virtually certain that legislation will pass the congress imposing controls during the coming four years
5991746 anticipated that an additional 650 billion cubic feet of natural gas could be recovered in our region through carbon dioxide injection the value of that resource would be approximately 3 9 billion in enhanced methane production
5991747 our region would also enjoy the prestige that accompanies the contribution our region will make to solving one of our nations most pressing energy needs
5991748 june shott made possible the astroturf for the artificial field that is there
5991749 we will now have as good of a stadium as there is in west virginia when this is over we already have a lot of activity at that stadium and maybe we can attract some more activity
5991750 labour people who are in hand to hand combat with the snp want to see me as leader of the party
5991751 this is a battle to the death with the snp thats how i see it and many party members see it
5991752 i was hoping it the executions would be before the fasting month but it cannot
5991753 i have nothing to cover up ill be open about this
5991754 the possibility is slim because the courts are the ones who have the authority to postpone it
5991755 all who are involved will get gods wrath and curse and will be put in hell forever
5991756 but i was wondering why those who kill over 200 people are afraid of facing the death penalty themselves
5991757 i think if we have a review of the status of the death penalty we have to review the overall system of punishment because we dont want to see for example someone who is involved in a serious murder be freed before the age of 50 or below 50 and continue to be a problem for the society
5991758 the possibility of the death penalty being abolished has to be balanced with a more adequate system of punishment
5991759 im open for having this we are all quite open to discuss it
5991760 when our american friends tell us its the middle east which is the most likely area of proliferation and nuclear chemical and biological weapons theyre not
5991761 its asia that has the most potent latent capabilities to develop nuclear chemical and biological weapons
5991762 thats because of the advance of their economies and industrial base
5991763 japan goes nuclear only if it loses confidence in the american alliance
5991764 and if japan develops a nuclear weapon china would immediately proliferate a number of ballistic missiles and warheads and whats the betting south korea would develop a nuclear weapon
5991765 youve got no arms control or disarmament agreements worth talking about
5991766 i dont detect any great interest in the region to have this conversation
5991767 we will have to repatriate him back to vietnam because he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter
5991768 he could be returned to his homeland since we do not want him here
5991769 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
5991770 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5991771 we dont feel its appropriate he spends his time hopping from one country to the next one while countries decide what to do with him
5991772 none of his colleagues would defend him the labor cabinet has deserted him
5991773 today we saw the mask of statesmanship fall away and the true face of anger emerge in all its fury
5991774 the speaker actually did make a direction in relation to interjections which i regrettably didnt hear
5991775 i am now suspended for the course of question time i do regret that its a real pity
5991776 to have done so would have constituted an unreasonable and unacceptable challenge to the authority and independence of the speaker
5991777 you should not have to put up with this any more and i am sick of it
5991778 they earn 13 000 less than their school colleagues that is unsustainable
5991779 unless we get that resolved before the end of the year we will see tafe teachers leaving in their droves to teach in secondary schools or to go back to industry
5991780 our students earn more than some of us such as students from the army that are paid 60 000 a year to study
5991781 we acknowledge tafe teachers want to maintain the equivalent pay they have had in the past with schoolteachers and think thats a reasonable request
5991782 at the same time the union needs to put on the table productivity increases and mount a case so we can substantiate that to government
5991783 i was just trying to make sure i was in a good position keeping an eye on the board and seeing where everyone else was
5991784 im just coming here to win thats the aim for me
5991785 i dont even think about not having a leg and if i want to keep competing i will have to continue to qualify with the able bodied for me its not about the disability at all

5991835 our research clearly shows that 40 of people from british ethnic communities keep in touch with their families back home by calls or text an extremely costly habit to maintain we are therefore very excited to launch this campaign as part of the programme we have launched an exclusive expat survival guide blog www vykehome com offering first hand advice on coping with homesickness and adapting to life in the uk sourav himself will be writing a number of the blogs we are extremely excited to have sourav on board as his global lifestyle and strong connection with friends and family make him the perfect vyke user and ambassador
5991836 weve seen ehealthforum triple its traffic in a year 15 percent in the last two months actually more noticeably a dramatic increase of visitors to our ask a doctor section on average over 100 people are seeking our doctors advice per day it has become apparent that more and more people are checking out medical advice online before visiting their regular doctor or they want a second opinion
5991837 more and more people find the unconditional support from others in our forums play a significant role in the healing process indeed many of our visitors go on to become volunteers posting responses help and support on other peoples posts caring and sharing is a great healer in itself many of our visitors discover that others have had similar experiences which they find enormously helpful a problem shared is a problem halved and thats half the battle
5991838 as technology develops i think we might see more and more people turn to online consultations and i hope to be on the edge of that movement
5991839 database archiving often fails to get the attention it needs compared to other critical activities related to production databases and data warehouses
5991840 an archival system becomes critical when you need to access archived information in response to a legal summons customer service issue security investigation or technical issue the value of archiving grows considerably as it becomes easier to access the archived data
5991841 with legal demands for access growing conventional approaches to database archiving are increasingly being found lacking they focus on lifting and shifting inactive data from production databases to improve application performance without considering how to optimize the way archived data is stored get your archiving right and you reduce storage costs and guarantee simple future proofed access get it wrong and at worst you could face prison
5991842 why database archiving should be part of your dbms strategy
5991843 it managers need to achieve a balance between the compliance demands for retention and the business demand for economical storage and retrieval current database management system technology is optimised for transactional processing data warehouses are optimised for analytics but both fail to adequately address archiving needs worse still the lines between archive stores and backup which have very different drivers and requirements are all too often blurred
5991844 forresters research clearly illustrates the need for the new generation of archive stores these deliver both massive reductions in storage footprints through data compression together with the security immutability and point in time query capability that enables quick simple and unimpeachable fulfilment of regulatory obligations

5991874 i believe in a god of some kind in some sort of higher being personally i find it very comforting
5991875 how can you take seriously someone who likes to believe something because he finds it comforting
5991876 if evidence were found for a supreme being i would change my mind instantly with pride and with great surprise would i find it comforting what matters is what is true and we discover truth by evidence not what we would like
5991877 when our american friends tell us its the middle east which is the most likely area of proliferation and nuclear chemical and biological weapons theyre not
5991878 its asia that has the most potent latent capabilities to develop nuclear chemical and biological weapons
5991879 thats because of the advance of their economies and industrial base
5991880 japan goes nuclear only if it loses confidence in the american alliance
5991881 and if japan develops a nuclear weapon china would immediately proliferate a number of ballistic missiles and warheads and whats the betting south korea would develop a nuclear weapon
5991882 youve got no arms control or disarmament agreements worth talking about
5991883 you should not have to put up with this any more and i am sick of it
5991884 they earn 13 000 less than their school colleagues that is unsustainable
5991885 unless we get that resolved before the end of the year we will see tafe teachers leaving in their droves to teach in secondary schools or to go back to industry
5991886 our students earn more than some of us such as students from the army that are paid 60 000 a year to study
5991887 we acknowledge tafe teachers want to maintain the equivalent pay they have had in the past with schoolteachers and think thats a reasonable request
5991888 at the same time the union needs to put on the table productivity increases and mount a case so we can substantiate that to government
5991889 we believe this is a first for the industry with various agents and cruiselines all participating together for a common goal both members and associate cruiselines who would not normally be able to afford to promote themselves in the national press have jumped at the chance to be part of this promotion there is no better time to shout about the lca

5991909 well i just signed up here because we got rid of the car and its the closest gym with a pool for me i knew i wouldnt keep going to a gym that was hard to get to
5991910 you know i always tell people theres no magic bullet
5991911 but you have to change your behavior over time and really find a way to stick with it
5991912 lose weight youre going to have to crank it up and challenge yourselves
5991913 you of all people should know not everyone exercises to lose weight
5991914 so how much do you want to lose and where do you want to lose it from
5991915 i just want to be able to run better and crush teacakes with my fist i dont see how weight is relevant
5991916 ok then come on in whenever you can use the treadmill
5991917 excuse me im recovering from an eating disorder and x is not helpful to me
5991918 how to treat fat people working out at your gym
5991919 if nothing else point out that joking about pushing your plate away being
5991920 yknow i have this friend and shes anorexic and working really hard to overcome that and i really wanted to bring her with me to this gym but i really worry because a few things you said today in this class would be really triggering to someone like her
5991921 stick with this and in 6 months youll like yourself
5991922 and im just like no you couldnt and you dont look as good in a speedo either
5991923 were busy people must have been inspired to try swimming
5991924 were busy god all these delusional fatties think theyre as good as michael phelps
5991925 those lazy fatties are too gross to exercise they should stay at home until theyre less lazy
5991926 yeah we work the biceps all the time make jerk off gesture with thumb at the top when we need to be working the triceps
5991927 free to be fit is aerobics for large women taught by a large woman in free to be fit the environment is designed to be safe judgment free and fun so participants can enjoy pleasure based movement
5991928 this is why im not coming back to your class
5991929 well to be honest with you im really thinking about not coming back and heres why
5991930 yeah we work the biceps all the time make jerk off gesture with thumb at the top when we need to be working the triceps
5991931 if you dont like puking dont eat before you go to the gym
5991932 cant you see that i too am lifting i also am strengthening my muscles why do you have the right to this bench when i got there first
5991933 i have a gym membership and want to exercise but i dont want to 1 lose weight 2 train for anything 3 look like an idiot the personal trainers there are clueless and i cant afford my own my prior experience with exercising includes cosmo workouts yoga dvds and faking a fainting spell in middle school phys ed what do i do at the gym ps i have arthritis
5991934 make them feel good about themselves to start with and not the other way round
5991935 i wish i could find a personal trainer who would just listen to me and not be pushing any kind of weight loss agenda i just want to feel strong and fit and healthy
5991936 id drown you if you werent so fat that youd float anyway
5991937 look at the fat girl bounce isnt that so disgusting
5991938 listen i am healthy i eat what i want when i want and that im sure to your amazement doesnt mean krispy kreme donuts or whatever you like to presume fat people must eat in order to be fat im trying to exercise instead of encouraging me your making your little schoolyard bully snide remarks about how some people here look in swimsuits or about how because im fat the best thing for me is to learn eating disordered behaviour i can push the plate away however since what im eating is mostly healthy i dont need to i also dont need to starve to have the body you assume is proper for me to have so glare at me like an angry 2 year old about to throw a huge temper tantrum because youre not getting your way all you want im satisified with who i am i will be reporting you to your manager and if my complaints are ignored i will be going to a new gym it is beyond incompetant of you to behave like a snobby high school preppy girl who feels theyre in position to judge others ive never had to lower myself to making faces like small children because i am not afraid to say what is on my mind perhaps you should consider getting help with that making baby faces for a lack of social skills isnt attractive on anyone
5991939 ugh reading about peoples concerns about college gyms makes me feel split
5991940 when i first started teaching aerobics i thought i had to be skinny i starved myself down to 135 pounds then i had a coworker who was chubby who could kick my ass she told me i was an idiot and needed to eat properly so i could perform better i weigh 200 pounds now and if you call me fat ill punch your goddamn face in and i can i was a kickboxing champion for three years running im not here to make you skinny im here to make you kick ass any questions
5991941 is the ymcas bold approach to directly address our nations growing health crisis
5991942 there are some things you are doing that make me want to leave and never ever come back
5991943 i didnt have it in me when i was getting my masters
5991944 im not at all athletic im not like you all are
5991945 if something feels uncomfortable for you dont do it you can do your own thing
5991946 hey little 8 year old you havent put any weight on one leg for almost half a year it makes sense that that was really hard for you in fact we probably shouldnt have had you start on something that strenuous right after getting the cast off
5991947 everyone wants to change their body shape and when they havent after a couple of months they get disillusioned and go some do change shape but not weight because the muscles heavier and they get disillusioned too what keeps you two coming
5991948 im upset im angry it makes me feel like a non person
5991949 i saw him at christmas and birthdays and he provided money for school clothes and he called occasionally
5991950 the fact that weve never been recognised and then cindy has to put such a fine point on it by saying something thats not true
5991951 it really calmed me down it made me think you can give any little extra energy any piece of yourself you have left you dont have to save anything johnson said
5991952 going into that last routine i didnt care what score i got i just wanted to hit the best routine i could to finish off my experience and not have any regrets
5991953 i didnt want to leave here thinking i could have done better finishing off that routine knowing i hit the best routine i could at the time it felt amazing
5991954 she tumbles on the beam like other people tumble on the floor
5991955 but this issue will have to be taken into view
5991956 the enforcement of council by laws regarding parades is not a matter for the police
5991957 from time to time lawyers and judges have tried to define what constitutes fairness like defining an elephant it is not easy to do although fairness in practice has the elephantine quality of being easy to recognise as a result of these efforts a word in common usage has acquired the trappings of legalism acting fairly has become acting in accordance with the rules of natural justice and on occasion has been dressed up with latin tags this phrase in my opinion serves no useful purpose and in recent years it has encouraged lawyers to try to put those who hold inquiries into legal straitjackets for the purposes of my judgment i intend to ask myself this simple question did the decision maker act fairly towards the plaintiff

5991962 as an american i do not feel that the israelis are obligated or required to give up land in order to bring peace
5991963 you do not achieve peace by creating a situation where you can not defend your borders and therefore protect your citizens having a temporary cessation of hostility is not peace if while that cessation of hostility is going on just across the border arms are being built up for the purpose of eventually pushing that border down
5991964 knowing that not that many feet away someone has a rocket pointed at him
5991965 we are talking about a postage stamp where israel is

5991967 i just want to announce that i am supporting you for president
5991968 in this area we must balance all reasonable conclusions with evidence that is backed up by proper statistical studies personally when i want to structure an argument regarding gaming in indonesia i look to the studies and conclusions of viggiani wymer who was a pioneer in the field and highly regarded statistician

5991975 for each of these three terminals i had three different sets of user commands so if i was talking online with someone at sads and i wanted to talk to someone i knew at berkeley or m e about this i had to get up from the sads terminal go over and log into the other terminal and get in touch with them i said oh man its obvious what to do if you have these three terminals there ought to be one terminal that goes anywhere you want to go where you have interactive computing that idea is the arpanet
5991976 i do not see consumers taking a view that rates will drop prompting them to go out and buy a new car or spend more on clothing immediately

5992006 youve got no arms control or disarmament agreements worth talking about
5992007 i dont detect any great interest in the region to have this conversation
5992008 weve also said the green energy has to be in addition to victorias existing renewable energy targets and those two commitments make it very clear that it will be additional green power that is sourced to meet the governments commitments
5992009 and i think that shows the governments credibility in ensuring the impact of this plant is minimised
5992010 every time we make a commitment to build something like this that increases emissions we are going a step backwards
5992011 the government made the decision to go ahead with it so they are not going to come up with an ees that says its not a goer it was a fait accompli

5992034 as every traveler knows the system remains an uncoordinated mess because governments are not thinking or acting globally
5992035 the bilateral system must change because it prevents airlines from acting like normal businesses airlines cannot serve markets until governments negotiate access and we cannot merge or consolidate across borders because of foreign ownership restrictions
5992036 who cares who owns an airline so long as it is safe and provides efficient service its time to move from the world of flags and politics to brands and business

5992059 this is the first time that anyone has combined these two nanotechnologies to develop a smart sensor
5992060 the traditional cmos approach has many limitations so we needed to find a new approach
5992061 as well as being the smallest sensor on the market to date it will have extreme low power consumption
5992062 we will develop two kinds of nanosensor devices on silicon on insulator substrates a common key structure used for both devices is a very thin suspended silicon bridge
5992063 in the first nanosensor device the suspended nanobridge with or without an integrated silicon quantum dot cavity is used as a channel of a transistor with side gates
5992064 small charge transfer caused by the molecules captured on the surface of the nanobridge channel is detected electrically as a change in the conductance
5992065 in the second nanosensor device the suspended nanobridge is used as a movable gate of a nanoscale transistor
5992066 a small mass change due to the molecules captured on the nanobridge gate surface is detected electrically as a change in the resonant frequency of the gate
5992067 our nanobridge transistor with a suspended quantum dot works as an extremely sensitive charge detector which in principle senses charge transfer of even a single electron occurring on the surface of the quantum dot this cannot be achieved by using a convectional mosfet structure

5992114 simon is a bit down he is sick to the back teeth with injury problems and he is disappointed not to reach some of the targets he has set himself such as 50 championship wickets this season
5992115 but he has done marvellously for us he has given our attack something it didnt have hes been an aggressive impact bowler and ive been delighted with him

5992135 i was rolling with a certain hollywood figure who may or may not have been aforementioned as a guest singer on this record and this tattoo artist i was rolling with in order to keep her in my life as my friend it meant the end of the potential for another aspect of our relationship so it was more of a disappointment

5992175 despite receiving huge funds from the center we are striving to build good airports we struggle to achieve proper topographical condition to ensure visibility and safety for the airlines the region despite having enormous tourism and industrial potential is still not well connected these airports are too small to accommodate the aircraft that is why they have been non operational all these years

5992184 yes but i shouldnt have to do even this why cant it just test whats in the target directory building a separate run directory for every test and forcing the user to deliberately choose files to deploy is just another symptom of the high ceremony mstest approach
5992185 it creates a separate test project because too many morts out there will just put it in the same project otherwise and all your tests will be deployed with the code
5992186 i agree that its best to have a separate test project
5992187 i understand it fine but the people i work with or the maintenance people wont
5992188 having the built in ability to test private and internal methods properties fields is the biggest reason i love it
5992189 one of the core reasons for doing tdd is way it drives your design if you have to access private members in your tests i would submit that your design is not correctly decoupled i want my testing framework to force me to behave like any other client when im writing tests

5992200 the maintenance shops have averaged about 635 jobs a month since their arrival in december 2007
5992201 thats over 4 400 jobs at least in the last 7 months some jobs are definitely more time consuming than others but in the end every job has to be completed with the least downtime possible

5992276 we have a situation where africans have been forced to flee their continent a continent which is rich in all its natural resources but remains economically backward

5992283 the anniversary of the september 11 terrorist attacks should forever remain a day of unity
5992284 all of us including those seeking public office can best honor the memories of those lost by engaging in community service and other charitable acts on that day which help to recall and rekindle the remarkable spirit of unity and compassion that existed in our country in the weeks and months following the 9 11 tragedy
5992285 9 11 helped us realize in an instant how insignificant our differences really are in comparison to our common goodness as human beings and our shared sense of compassion for those in need
5992286 it hardly mattered what political party we supported or whether we came from a red state or blue state at that moment we were all human beings and it is important that we find a way each year on 9 11 to honor that spirit of togetherness and keep it alive
5992287 as a 9 11 family member the only good thing that came from that terrible day was the way our nation came together however fleeting that moment might have been
5992288 i cannot think of a better way to honor the memories of those lost than to put aside our differences for just a little while and consider what the world could be like if we preserved that sense of compassion and understanding at other times throughout the year

5992309 it is the understanding of the government of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland that the government of the federation of nigeria agree to the following provisions
5992310 i all obligations and responsibilities of the government of the united kingdom which arises from any valid international instrument shall henceforth in so far as such instrument may be held to have application to nigeria be assumed by the government of the federation of nigeria ii the rights and benefits heretofore enjoyed by the government of the united kingdom in virtue of the application of any such international instrument to nigeria shall henceforth be enjoyed by the government of the federation of nigeria
5992311 respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each state and for its inalienable right to independent existence
5992312 solemnly declares that all member states pledge themselves to respect the borders existing on their achievement of national independence
5992313 this ministry has given a most careful consideration to the whole question in the light of all the available evidence and the conclusion is that there is no legal basis for nigerias claims to the bakasi peninsula for the reasons stated herein according to the information received from the federal directorate of surveys the bakasi peninsula has never been included as part of nigeria in the administrative maps of nigeria since the then southern cameroons ceased to be part of nigeria in 1961 also the northern region western region and eastern region definition of boundaries proclamation 1954 l n 126 of 154 showed the bakasi peninsula as forming part of the then southern cameroons moreover by a diplomatic note no 570 of march 27 1962 from your ministry to the embassy of the cameroons in lagos to which was attached a map prepared by the federal surveys nigeria recognized the bakasi peninsula as forming part of the cameroons
5992314 the line of the fastest flow along the course of a river

5992316 xix should the thalweg of the lower akwayafe upstream from the line bakasi point king point change its position in such a way as to affect the relative positions of the thalweg and the mangrove islands a new adjustment of the boundary shall be made on the basis of the new positions as determined by a map to be made for the purpose xx should the lower course of the akwayafe so change its mouth as to transfer it to the rio del rey it is agreed that the area now known as the bakasi peninsula shall still remain german territory the same condition applies to any portion of territory now agreed to as being british which may be cut off in a similar way
5992317 xxi from the centre of the navigable channel on a line joining bakasi point and king point the boundary shall follow the centre of the navigable channel of the akwayafe river as far as the 3 mile limit of territorial jurisdiction for the purpose of defining this boundary the navigable channel of the akwayafe river shall be considered to lie wholly to the east of the navigable channel of the cross and calabar rivers

5992320 xxi from the centre of the navigable channel on a line joining bakasi point and king point the boundary shall follow the centre of the navigable channel of the akwayafe river as far as the 3 mile limit of territorial jurisdiction
5992321 xxii the 3 mile limit shall as regards the mouth of the estuary be taken as a line 3 nautical miles seaward of a line joining sandy point and tom shot point
5992322 for the purpose of defining this boundary the navigable channel of the akwayafe river shall be considered to lie wholly to the east of the navigable channel of the cross and calabar rivers
5992323 rough handling of nigerians in the small fishing villages along the porous borders the discovery of offshore oil in the area of rio del rey only compounded our problems
5992324 xxiii nothing in this agreement shall prevent british or german vessels whether public or private from using the most convenient course between the open sea and the akwayafe river and from navigating that river without any differential treatment whatever
5992325 thus since the new channel on cross calabar river is man made it does not preclude the use of the disused channel for purposes of negotiation 1981 on may 16 1981 nigerian soldiers in three canoes were ambushed and killed by camerounian soldiers shehu shagari beckoned to serve
5992326 the boundary regime established by the anglo german agreements of 13 march 1913 and 6 july 1914 is binding on both nigeria and cameroun by virtue of a rule of customary international law reflected in article 11 of the vienna convention on succession of states in respect of treaties 1978 as well as in the declaration of the organization of african unity of july 1964 and in respect of nigeria the exchange of notes with the united kingdom of 1 october 1960 this regime cannot thus be abrogated or modified unilaterally by either nigeria or cameroun
5992327 henceforth relations between our two countries grew from strength to strength while the border dispute was carefully buried in files maps and legal documents
5992328 what complicated the cameroonian case however was that many nigerians reside in cameroonian territory where they spend part of their lives to fish or farm while there in search of livelihood they often criss cross the boundaries also fishermen and traders did not bother about the actual position of the borders while in the territorial waters of each of the two countries until they were advised or confronted as the case may be
5992329 the bbcs omer songwe has just visited the cameroonian side of bakassi and says that 95 of the people in the area are nigerians

5992355 how can one achieve independence by joining you can only choose to join after you are independent and not the other way round february 11 1961 was dependence day for southern cameroonians they chose to be independent by being dependent how can they be given the options to join two other independent republics and claimed at the end that they have achieved independence they all should bear a part of the brunt of the blame and stop pointing accusing fingers at each other the ambiguity of the plebiscite questions was an intentional act by the british to either subject us to continuous tutelage by joining nigeria or go to hell by joining la republique the british never wished that southern cameroons should achieve independence

5992359 out of the nine cameroonian military officers who were on board the boat conducting a docking maneuver in the bakassi peninsula six were abducted by the assailants during the attack

5992361 the six other occupants of the boat were captured by the assailants who took them to an unknown direction at the same time carrying weapons and the boat

5992441 i wasnt sure what to expect when i came in to work on a video game
5992442 what i realized is red alert 3 is not just a video game its absolutely an interactive movie this is where the people at home get to move the story forward and where seeing the plot thicken is a reward for a job well done and thats really cool
5992443 i think video games are one of the new frontiers for actors and using live action is just another way to connect more easily to the gamer rather than cg or animation techniques
5992444 to be in a groundbreaking game like red alert 3 where we are using full on shooting of live actors and to be with jonathan pryce tim curry and peter stormare it was a great opportunity for a character actor like me to have some fun
5992445 its totally frustrating especially after flogging yourself for eight weeks in pre season and then just when you start to look forward to the games this happens
5992446 there can be no business as usual with russia under the present circumstances
5992447 they blame us as if there were no requirements for the georgian side in the six points
5992448 i mean the requirements to bring back their troops to the places where they are on a permanent basis
5992449 are not and have never been after just small pieces of georgian territory
5992450 they want to demoralize my people and put them into panic
5992451 they want to not only get rid of the georgian government but get rid of all idea of georgias independence and freedom
5992452 every day that goes by after the deadline is a day that the world can see that russia is not living up to its word
5992453 with every commitment and every failure to live up to the commitment international pressure will grow
5992454 military action must cease definitively and military forces must return to their positions held prior to the outbreak of hostilities
5992455 as long as russian forces are basically occupying a large part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convene at whatever level
5992456 i should add that we certainly do not have the intention to close all doors in our communication with russia but the future will depend on the concrete actions from the russian side
5992457 full and immediate compliance with the cease fire agreement to which the parties have subscribed
5992458 they can put it to a vote if they want to

5992473 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5992474 is trying to make a victim of the aggressor to absolve of guilt a criminal regime
5992475 i think it would be a thing of beauty if when lady liberty looks out on the horizon she not only welcomes new immigrants but lights their way with a torch powered by an ocean wind farm
5992476 perhaps companies will want to put wind farms atop our bridges and skyscrapers
5992477 i think weve got to be careful in not automatically saying things cant work

5992479 ill have the best boobs in the nursing home ill be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
5992480 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it
5992481 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
5992482 shes been sort of this quiet warrior in the back and has been a great support telling me that i was going to be ok
5992483 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes
5992484 and i think that its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
5992485 pretty is what changes impossible choices the breast cancer gene and how i defied my destiny
5992486 if i waited two more hours id still be stuck in georgia
5992487 there was a witness who saw some of the encounter
5992488 he was able to get a license plate number and internal affairs was able to identify the owners of the car they sat on the car and arrested both of these officers
5992489 if these allegations prove true it is a horrendous case a horrendous situation
5992490 im just happy to be alive right now and with my family
5992491 it was just a really bad choice on their part
5992492 you think you have what it takes and then you get here
5992493 they were nice about it at least they said you are not what we are looking for but it was hard to hear
5992494 maybe i shouldnt have told them im getting an mba
5992495 i thought this was about talent not who had the biggest breasts
5992496 what i am going to look like when i win
5992497 there are 20 000 other blondes here who can sing so i thought this would help me stand out
5992498 afterwards they said i hope you havent been wearing that all day
5992499 i perceived lennon at that time and wrongly judged him to be a phony it was more about me and not him i was probably mad at myself for my failures
5992500 i just saw his face and it seemed like it all came together the solution to my problem of being confused and feeling like a nobody
5992501 and i said wouldnt it be something if i killed this individual that was my thought
5992502 i am ashamed that is my first thought i am sorry for what i did
5992503 i just had dug a big hole for myself and was feeling like a big nothing and a nobody
5992504 im relieved and excited the kids will be home soon
5992505 there will be a lot of hugs and kisses and probably some laundry to be done
5992506 the scariest thing was you could hear the trees snapping and breaking
5992507 we had become an island there was water to the left and right of us
5992508 potentially what were going to be doing today will translate into a billion dollars or more off of next years deficit
5992509 all she was trying to do was make things better for her and her kids
5992510 jashya was returned with the consent and advice of both acs and the childs law guardian
5992511 hes so busy im sure not even his agent can get a hold of him
5992512 it was like a storybook marriage but sometimes chapters go in different directions
5992513 this is his world and im just watching him travel through it
5992514 people ask me how hes doing where hes swimming next and its hard to say that i dont know
5992515 when we started my dad would be up at 4 a m on the mornings i had 5 30 practice
5992516 the person i love the most is sitting in the front row my mom for everything shes done
5992517 there are reasons and i really dont want to get into that
5992518 he didnt call me after i set my first world record in 2001
5992519 i would have thought that the kids who were on the margins of passing that you would have seen many of them go over the top
5992520 why that didnt happen we should look closely at why thats going on
5992521 were going to try and figure out what worked at these schools and how we can apply what happened at these schools to some of the other schools
5992522 obviously well be disappointed next year and in future years if theres no increase in the number of students passing but were not discouraged at all
5992523 it got to the point that we were sitting at breakfast and prepping each other on ap us history trivia
5992524 i can definitely see gabby and ashley breaking into the england side this season they can be as good as they want
5992525 they have great potential they have everything in front of them they are both young with fantastic skills and they can both succeed and go a long way in the game
5992526 it is the start of a new era for england and there is a good generation of players coming through i think they will be very strong in the years to come and gabby and ashley can be part of that
5992527 the good thing is the players want to learn gabby has improved so much in just my time here since january 2007 and i am sure he will continue to get even better
5992528 he can be as good as he wants to be and there is definitely more to come from him i also think all the young players at

5992533 this is not the end of the competition commission process
5992534 we will continue to point out to the commission the many areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies would be disproportionate and counterproductive

5992543 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5992544 kategoes are doing a theme tune for a new bbc sitcom called coming of age

5992548 i really want this relationship to work and i hope our trust can go on forever
5992549 so long as the people do not care to exercise their freedom those who wish to tyrannize will do so for tyrants are active and ardent and will devote themselves in the name of any number of gods religious and otherwise to put shackles upon sleeping men
5992550 it is high time for me to put an end to your sitting in this place which you have dishonored by your contempt of all virtue and defiled by your practice of every vice ye are a factious crew and enemies to all good government ye are a pack of mercenary wretches and would like esau sell your country for a mess of pottage and like judas betray your god for a few pieces of money
5992551 never never never believe any war will be smooth and easy or that anyone who embarks on the strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter the statesman who yields to war fever must realize that once the signal is given he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events
5992552 muslims should fulfill jihad with the heart tongue and hand muslims use the heart in their struggle to resist evil the tongue may convince others to take up worthy causes such as funding medical research hands may perform good works and correct wrongs
5992553 he told followers to share their wealth and to care for the less fortunate in society
5992554 i am concerned at the subtle hostility being directed my way now from officials at the school and school district and am also afraid that it is creating an adversarial situation that will negatively impact my own child
5992555 muslims believe that god had spoken to muhammad through the angel
5992556 muhammad reported new revelations about rules for muslim government society and worship god told muhammad that muslims should face mecca when they pray
5992557 ayesha and yazid stand with their parents for hours praying in the blistering sun but that memory soon fades when the sister and brother learn that they will spend the evening camping under the stars
5992558 agree with their parents that being near muhammad was especially meaningful
5992559 he told followers to share their wealth and to care for the less fortunate in society
5992560 fasting also reminds muslims of people in the world who struggle to get enough food
5992561 muhammad told his followers to make sure their guests never left a table hungry
5992562 about arab traditions such as being kind to strangers and helping orphans widows and other needy members of society
5992563 an arab man named muhammad introduced islam to the people of the arabian peninsula
5992564 although the first muslims lived in arabia islam spread through the middle east
5992565 why is islam involved in quite so many modern wars of religion
5992566 there was much blending of cultures under muslim rule over time many peoples in muslim ruled territories converted to islam they were attracted by islams message of equality and hope for salvation
5992567 many conquered people became muslims because they found islams message of equality and hope attractive
5992568 the concept of jihad covers all activities that either defend islam or else further its cause
5992569 i am a militant and i have no fear for myself i have spent my life in
5992570 to exert oneself or to strive other meanings include endeavor strain effort diligence struggle it should not be understood to mean holy war a common misrepresentation
5992571 to do ones best to resist temptation and overcome evil
5992572 some muslims look on jihad or effort in gods service as another duty jihad has often been mistakenly translated simply as holy war in fact it may include acts of charity or an inner struggle to achieve spiritual peace as well as any battle in defense of islam
5992573 muslims also have the duty of jihad or striving to overcome challenges as they strive to please god
5992574 to make an effort or to struggle jihad refers to the inner struggle people go through in their effort to obey god and behave according to islamic ways jihad can also mean the struggle to defend the muslim community or historically to convert people to islam the word has also been translated as holy war
5992575 shariah sets rewards for good behavior and punishments for crimes
5992576 the primary source of islamic law is the quran rules and precepts that are clearly stated in the quran are not open to debate and must be accepted at face value
5992577 the system of islamic law or sharia attempts to regulate all aspects of human life
5992578 by the law of the quran but if you do not find any
5992579 muhammad taught that there was no difference between everyday life and religious life
5992580 continues to develop in response to modern ways of life and its challenges
5992581 shariah or islamic law helps muslims live by the teachings of the quran it includes practices of daily life as well as the duty to respect others
5992582 a unique culture flourished in cities like cordoba and toledo where muslims jews and christians lived together in peace
5992583 a terrible ordeal for many muslims an unknown number of muslims lost their lives in battles and massacres crusaders also destroyed muslim property
5992584 began as a response to the threat posed by the seljuks
5992585 promised entry to heaven to all who joined the fight
5992586 the victorious crusaders massacred muslims and jews throughout the city the survivors were sold into slavery
5992587 christians are trounced and portrayed as murderers of the muslim and jewish people
5992588 victimized persecuted and murdered by the 20 christians all the while islam builds great and grand new empires has many great and wonderful achievements in architecture education science geography mathematics medicine literature art and music and ultimately rules benevolently over the jewish and christian people
5992589 mobs of peasants turned on jews who would not instantly convert to christianity thousands of jews killed themselves and their families in order to escape the crusaders knives
5992590 jews who faced persecution in christian lands flocked to al andalus to enjoy this freedom
5992591 the violence unleashed by the crusades caused great suffering for the jews crusaders in the holy land slaughtered jews as well as muslims other jews became slaves
5992592 in the 19th and 20th centuries muslim scholars began debating womens roles many argued that muslims needed to rethink outdated interpretations that narrowed the lives of women in nations like turkey and iran these debates led to an expansion of womens rights and freedoms
5992593 there has been a shift toward more traditional roles for women this trend is especially noticeable in iran
5992594 one of the most disgraceful developments of our time is that many western authors and intellectuals who pride themselves on being liberals have effectively aligned themselves with an outrageously illiberal movement
5992595 acts ofterror have become a regular aspect of modern society around the globe
5992596 muslims have not accommodated their religious beliefs to the modern world
5992597 poverty and ignorance lie at the root of the problem
5992598 most muslims around the world do not share this vision nor do they agree with the use of terrorism
5992599 the islamist movement appeals to many muslims some have used violence to pursue their goals however many muslims oppose the extremism of the islamists
5992600 although the vast majority of muslims believe terrorism is contrary to their faith militants began using terrorism to achieve their goals
5992601 tv has encouraged global terrorism to some extentbecause terrorists know that newscasts create instant publicity
5992602 tv images of american jetliners flying into the world trade center in new york city in 2001 for example created immediate awareness of the goals of islamic fundamentalist militants
5992603 islamic fundamentalists found it easy to make israel or western nations scapegoats for their problems in the past few decades terrorist attacks have increased against these scapegoats
5992604 a historical precedent for islamic terrorism was the arab nationalism that helped nations in the middle east come together after a history of europeancolonialism
5992605 muslim middle easterners have disagreed over the role of islam in a modern economy
5992606 although there have been many acts of terrorism in american history most terroristattacks on americans since world war ii have been carried out by middle easterngroups the reason middle eastern terrorists have targeted americans can be traced backto events early in the twentieth century
5992607 bin laden had helped the warlords ofafghanistan drive the soviets out of their country in the 1980s in the 1990s he mobilized al qaeda to expel american business interests from his own country saudiarabia
5992608 by the new millennium he was providingaid training or money to scattered terrorist groups from morocco to indonesia
5992609 dedicated himself to driving westerners out of countries with a largely muslim population
5992610 however the arab israeli conflicts of 1948 forced 700 000 palestinian arabs from their homes in israeli territory the un set upcamps in neighboring areas to house palestinian refugees generations of palestiniansgrew up bitter about the loss of their homes the conflict between the israelis and palestinians continues today
5992611 israels government took land from palestinians and helped jewish settlers build homes in the occupied territories displacing more palestinians
5992612 critics from world war i onward warned that american support for a jewish statewould produce unending war severely damage americas otherwise amicable relations
5992613 the lebanese political party hezbollah formed after israel invaded lebanon originally itsgoal was to oust israel from lebanon and assert lebanese power it remains a strongparty today in recent years however factions of hezbollah have increasingly beensuspected of using terrorist tactics to attain its goals

5992618 standards for evaluating instructional materials for social content 2000 7 education code section 60044 a and subsection b
5992619 the term jihad conventionally translatedholy war has the literal meaning of striving more specifically in the quranic phrase strivingin the path of god fi sabil allah some muslim theologians particularly in more modern times have interpreted the duty of striving in the path of god in a spiritual and moral sense theoverwhelming majority of early authorities however citing relevant passages in the quran and inthe tradition discuss jihad in military terms virtually every manual of sharia law has a chapter on jihad which regulates in minute detail such matters as the opening conduct interruption andcessation of hostilities and the allocation and division of booty
5992620 the christian crusade often compared with the muslim jihad was itself a delayed and limited response to the jihad and in part also an imitation but unlike the jihad it was concerned primarily with thedefenceor reconquest of threatened or lost christian territory the muslim jihad in contrast was perceived as unlimited as a religious obligation that would continue until all the world hadeither adopted the muslim faith or submitted to muslim rule in the latter case those who professed what muslims recognized as a revealed religion were allowed to continue the practice ofthat religion subject to the acceptance of certain fiscal and other disabilities those who did not that is to say idolaters and polytheists were given the choice of conversion death or slavery
5992621 the object of jihad is to bring the whole world under islamic law it is not toconvert by force but to remove obstacles to conversion
5992622 the punishment of those who wage war against allah and his apostle and strive to makemischief in the land is only this that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and theirfeet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned this shall be as a disgracefor them in this world and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement
5992623 fight those who do not believein allah until they pay the tax in acknowledgment of superiority and they are in a state ofsubjection
5992624 therefore we will most certainly make those who disbelieve taste a severe punishment
5992625 to our great detriment ignoring what extremists say about jihad
5992626 even the christian crusade often compared with the muslim jihad was itself a delayed and limited response to the jihad and in part also an imitation but unlike the jihad it was concerned primarily with the defense or reconquest of threatened or lost christian territory
5992627 i finished off the olympic games with to me the most perfect ending ever
5992628 to finally get the gold medal on my very last routine meant the world to me
5992629 we went out there and showed we are the best going 1 2 in the all around thats never been done by the united states the americans have never had 1 2 on beam before either and 2 3 on floor isnt too bad
5992630 four years ago we had a large failure and we blamed ourselves
5992631 i would never trade one of my silvers for gold
5992632 what i went through to get them is very special to me and really touched my heart
5992633 she came in with the possibility of winning a few gold medals and that hasnt happened we were running out of chances
5992634 i knew it wasnt quite my best routine but i knew it was enough for a medal but im really happy for shawn three silvers is kind of hard to take i couldnt be more proud of her
5992635 thats the great ending she was a little bit disappointed after the all around but she went all the way to the end i can appreciate that
5992636 to finally have a gold and be an olympic gold medalist its what everyone dreams of
5992637 i hit the floor and i looked at mark and said can you believe that just happened
5992638 you cant be upset with two medals at my first olympics
5992639 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5992640 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5992641 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5992642 weve definitely been excited about the growth and embrace of technology by both voters and candidates
5992643 its been explosive its light years from 2004 youtube didnt exist four years ago and now it is being heavily used for politics
5992644 google is attempting to expand its influence over the political process to help it achieve its commercial goals
5992645 google likes to bask in self congratulatory rhetoric claiming it has the publics interests at heart its all about accessing peoples data for targeted marketing
5992646 in this us election year what information could be more important than the candidates own words to describe their views actions and platforms
5992647 as idealistic as that sounds is as idealistic as we are it is exciting all around not just for google
5992648 this new politics is disruptive upsetting old arrangements and displacing people invested in the old ways
5992649 los tel fonos no son malos hay que educar a los ni os para un buen uso

5992651 overall people have been calling and saying john mccain did an outstanding job
5992652 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as i will be a pro life president
5992653 mccain was so incredibly decisive and he was so clear in his answers there was no gray area
5992654 they feel like this is the start of john mccains coming out in terms of embracing the conservative evangelicals
5992655 i think they needed to hear it and they needed to hear it when the question was asked in that way that protections need to come at the moment of conception
5992656 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5992657 most people they dont do this for a living they dont study a candidates record and even when they see a record it has to be backed up by the candidate talking about it and making it important
5992658 people were before just kind of wringing their hands thinking what kind of mess do we have here what kind of choice do we have
5992659 i think he stopped the ambivalence that was out there toward
5992660 when they see mccains actual position and him talking about it it makes a difference instead of looking at roll call tallies
5992661 this became clearly no longer that this is the best of the two choices and moved from that over to this is a great great candidate that we need to get behind
5992662 either he had a heartfelt conversion on saturday or this is more manipulative electioneering
5992663 what saturday night provided was the closest view of the contrast between the two candidates that weve seen
5992664 when you have eight nine ten eleven twelve candidates running it takes people a while to get enthused
5992665 when you have a choice between someone you agree with on 80 percent of issues and someone who agreed with you on zero the choice becomes crystal clear

5992704 selection of virat kohli is premature i think india still have better batsman then him ganguly should be part of this one day team as opening batsman
5992705 it is high time we look beyond ganguly regarding utthapa he should play more domestic cricket to sharpen his batting nowadays there is a trend that once the player is selected for national side he does not play domestic cricket so players dont get used to playing long innings they can only play cameos look at laxman dravid ganguly they become great players because when they entered international cricket they had a vast experience which comes from playing first class cricket and compare to that with the current crop of cricketers rohit sharmas first class average 35 yuvraj singhs first class average 42 virat kohli very less first class cricket let them go through the grind for few years then they will understand the importance of staying on the crease and get used to playing long innings

5992708 bad captaincy by dhoni to have allowed seventh wicket partership of 70 and to have given bowlers like yuvraj at 44 for 6 he should wrapped up the innings below 100 by using main bowlers and not part timers though as much as i like dhoni i believe the media and analysts overlook his mistakes

5992725 i watched him walk on the pitch alongside lionel messi and riquelme full argentina internationals and great great players
5992726 it was quite special and hopefully the premier league arena will hold no fears for him after playing in games like that

5993085 it was known european chickens were introduced into the american continents by the spanish after their arrival in the 15th century but there was ongoing debate about the presence of pre columbian chickens in south america
5993086 this is a crucial issue for archaeology because if chickens were in south america before the spanish arrived it means people must have brought them there across the breadth of the pacific ocean

5993094 this is extremely bad news for consumers who may be considering consolidating existing debts to try to drive down their monthly expenditure

5993104 consumers are feeling anxious and have every right to be with the governments inability to reassure the market especially over the issue of stamp duty
5993105 decisive action in this area is needed as we are concerned that the anticipation of the suspension of stamp duty may halt the transactions in the housing market even further
5993106 what government should be focused on is raising the incomes and the aspirations and the opportunities for the millions of people who are stuck on low incomes and that is where this government has failed not because they are bad people not because they dont have noble ambitions but because their measure which is entirely reliant on the state which is about redistribution has failed failed on their own terms
5993107 our education system is failing to spread opportunity our welfare system is keeping people out of work our tax system makes it extremely difficult for those on low incomes to get off those low incomes because those marginal tax rates are so high
5993108 labour has failed it has created a more unfair society and i think there is a real opportunity for the conservative party now to lead this debate
5993109 we will keep tax credits but we will add to the battle on poverty other things like welfare reform like extending educational opportunity like supporting families and these conservative methods of achieving progressive goals are likely to be far more successful and create a fairer society
5993110 at the moment borrowing is rising and thats a real issue
5993111 the truth is gordon browns old fashioned leftist idea that only the state can guarantee fairness has led to a decade of top down state control policies that have made our country less fair
5993112 first it was change then it was aspiration and earlier this year it was all about government being on your side
5993113 now were told before its even started that the next gordon brown relaunch will be about fairness

5993169 its been explosive its light years from 2004 youtube didnt exist four years ago and now it is being heavily used for politics
5993170 google is attempting to expand its influence over the political process to help it achieve its commercial goals
5993171 google likes to bask in self congratulatory rhetoric claiming it has the publics interests at heart its all about accessing peoples data for targeted marketing
5993172 in this us election year what information could be more important than the candidates own words to describe their views actions and platforms

5993196 character cannot be developed in ease and quiet only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened ambition inspired and success achieved
5993197 the best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched they must be felt within the heart

5993251 when our american friends tell us its the middle east which is the most likely area of proliferation and nuclear chemical and biological weapons theyre not
5993252 its asia that has the most potent latent capabilities to develop nuclear chemical and biological weapons
5993253 thats because of the advance of their economies and industrial base
5993254 japan goes nuclear only if it loses confidence in the american alliance

5993273 every time we make a commitment to build something like this that increases emissions we are going a step backwards

5993376 sinn fein is the largest party in belfast but the presence of sinn f in chairpersons and mayors on many so councils across ulster is a potent reminder of the growth of the party in recent years one of the great challenges facing us in the time ahead is utilising that political strength to advance our republican goals and to deliver for those who have placed their confidence and trust in us citizens have the right to and the desire for material benefits and to effective political representation and our duty is to deliver that at a time of great change in our society as well as increasing economic difficulties our focus has to be on improving the living conditions for citizens on building prosperity and equality while advancing toward national freedom a crucial part of our work is the need for us to develop an entirely new relationship with unionism irish republicans believe in a united ireland we believe it is in the best interests of all the people who live on this island that british government interference and jurisdiction are ended unionists have a different view a different opinion the challenge for us is to persuade them of the value of the republican and democratic position there is an understandable frustration and annoyance and not just among nationalists and republicans at the dup s refusal to engage properly on issues like education the environment the irish language and of course policing powers today the dup finds itself in a place it never wanted to be a partnership government in which the checks and balances of the good friday agreement and the st andrews agreement have a dup minister on an equal status with a sinn f in minister in the joint office of first and deputy first minister as unionism comes to terms with these realities its various tendencies seem to be in a process of gradual re alignment so progress is slow yesterday after an unnecessarily long negotiation the dup and sinn f in set out areas of progress between us on the transfer of policing and justice powers but there is still work to be done on this including on the timeframe for transfer in my opinion the vast majority of citizens want transfer to take place they want the political institutions to work effectively they want the institutions to be delivering for them on all these matters as well as on other bread and butter issues like rising energy costs and the crisis on the housing market so part of our job of work in the time ahead is to ensure the institutions do deliver that means keeping our eye firmly fixed on our political goals as we continue to negotiate with the dup and the two governments on all of these issues
5993377 some boxing fans are of the opinion that i am over the hill well i want to show to them that i am not boxing is still in me and i will show the public that andrew sixhead lewis has what it takes to become a world champion again
5993378 many feel that after i lost my world title to ricardo mayorga followed by an unsuccessful attempt at world boxing organization wbo antonio margaritos welterweight title my days in the ring were numbered
5993379 but i am still crafty and skillful and when i step into the ring with eastman on october 5th at the national stadium i will be looking for a victory as i always do i still possess my qualities that made me a world champion such as skill and endurance and with god on my side i am ready to go out there and take him on and come away the victor
5993380 after suffering that defeat to dalton i went and recollected my thoughts to see where i went wrong after doing such and being given the opportunity to fight him again i had to prove not only to him or my fans but also myself that i am superior to him and that will also be the scenario when i face eastman
5993381 he eastman is a good fighter and i give him a lot of credit even though he has never won a world title i dont underestimate any of my opponents and it would be the same when i face him
5993382 however having seen him in action against dalton via television i think it was a sluggish encounter he was not near his best and i wish for him to be at his best when he faces me as it gives me an added boost when i face an opponent who is at his best and is giving his best
5993383 i would love to face raul frank who has been avoiding me like a plague or dreaded disease he has even refused to spar with me in the gym in new york and i want to take this opportunity to challenge him all he has to do is come out of his shell and put his name on the dotted line so we can get it on
5993384 special thanks to my trainers lennox daniels maurice bizzy boyce and former national amateur heavyweight champion terrence poole and all the sparring partners who have been helping with my preparations for this fight

5993387 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
5993388 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
5993389 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
5993390 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
5993391 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
5993392 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
5993393 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
5993394 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent
5993395 it is a bold historian who writes a history of the caucasus as events of the past week have made all too clear
5993396 welcome to chilo a planet with corrosive rain crushing pressure and deadly heat fortunately fourteen year old timas lives in one of the domed cities that float 100 000 feet above the surface circling near the edge of a monstrous perpetual storm above the acidic clouds the temperature and pressure are normal but to make a living timas like many other young men is lowered to the surface in an armored suit to scavenge what he can timass life is turned upside down when a strange man crash lands on the city the newcomer is fleeing an alien intelligence intent on invading the planet and discovering the secret hidden deep inside the perpetual storm a secret that could lead to interplanetary war
5993397 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us
5993398 when our american friends tell us its the middle east which is the most likely area of proliferation and nuclear chemical and biological weapons theyre not
5993399 its asia that has the most potent latent capabilities to develop nuclear chemical and biological weapons
5993400 thats because of the advance of their economies and industrial base
5993401 japan goes nuclear only if it loses confidence in the american alliance
5993402 and if japan develops a nuclear weapon china would immediately proliferate a number of ballistic missiles and warheads and whats the betting south korea would develop a nuclear weapon
5993403 youve got no arms control or disarmament agreements worth talking about
5993404 i dont detect any great interest in the region to have this conversation
5993405 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5993406 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5993407 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5993408 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5993409 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5993410 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5993411 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5993412 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5993413 the release of these stamps would revive an interest in philately
5993414 i will be compelled to tell the people of my country that they must now be prepared to suffer more sanctions and international isolation as we pursue a better more durable democracy
5993415 we are willing to engage in constructive dialogue not name calling not calling fiji zimbabwe which is a ridiculous proposition not calling commodore bainimarama mugabe
5993416 hes standing with the oil companies in opposing a bipartisan compromise in congress that would expand offshore drilling and at the same time make serious investments in alternative energy to break our dependence on foreign oil
5993417 when it comes to solving our energy problems john mccain is just more of the same and america cant afford it
5993418 saya insaf dan kesal dengan apa yang terjadi saya hilang segalanya dalam hidup saya merayu mahkamah menjatuhkan hukuman seringan yang mungkin kerana tidak mempunyai duit satu sen pun
5993419 i feel honored and am looking forward to the summit
5993420 i want to effect positive global change i believe learning sharing and networking at asia 21 young leaders summit will be a part of my personal journey toward that goal
5993421 even if compliance poses an incidental conflict with the defendants religious beliefs
5993422 doctors dont always agree on a prognosis there is a fair amount of objectivity and there is a certain amount of subjectivity
5993423 as a result of this recommendation it appears that dr rainville would not sign paperwork to support a total and permanent disability claim
5993424 it appears at this point that dc district chief famolare begins to doctor shop
5993425 following that appointment dr mahoney then signs off on dc famolares paperwork declaring him totally disabled
5993426 contain s no artificial ingredient or added color and is only minimally processed
5993427 ive been training real hard lately because i am preparing for the south american championships early next month so this is just going to be like preparation for that
5993428 russian human rights activists said during the hearings that police often stood by when skinhead and neo nazi groups staged demonstrations against jews ethnic minorities or foreigners
5993429 i got on and sat my beautiful glutes in a row of two unused seats facing forward taking the window seat its a good thing too because a perfectly poundable asian pussy rested its lips on the seat next to me
5993430 the origin was in germany at the turn of the 20th century
5993431 in america workers comp took root later in the 20th century
5993432 from the start it was designed to cover most non agricultural employment where there is a valid employer employee relationship
5993433 this insulates companies from the massive awards a plaintiff can win in other kinds of court
5993434 from the outset of the workers comp system an exclusive remedy rule has applied which severely limits the right of the employee to sue an employer for negligence
5993435 the injured worker has all of their medical expenses covered without deductions or co pays
5993436 doctor bills hospital bills prescription drug bills all of that is supposed to be covered
5993437 after a waiting period which varies by state and is never over seven days
5993438 workers comp covers all the medicals and indemnity expenses for the lifetime of the claim
5993439 there are rules in each state defining limits to benefits for injuries not deemed permanent in virtually all states the injured worker and their insurer can agree to settle a claim leaving the insurer without any further open obligation in some states many if not most permanent cases are settled
5993440 what are often not covered or covered but with often complicated exclusions are mental claims and disease claims such as cancers from exposure to toxins
5993441 generally these are not covered but court decisions have addressed these issues in virtually all states and these decisions rather than the language of the law tend to govern
5993442 the most common ground for rejecting claims which can only be done by the insurer is that the injury was not caused by work
5993443 a proficient adjuster should be able to make that determination perhaps with the help of a doctor who inspects the worker
5993444 in many states the adjuster can delay making such a decision for months
5993445 and if the adjuster decides then to deny the claim the already paid benefits to the worker are not returned
5993446 under workers comp law a person is not entitled to get benefits unless they are an employee
5993447 im not arguing about medical issues im not arguing about doctors im arguing that this person is not an employee
5993448 and the rules set largely by court decisions vary by states
5993449 typically an independent contractor is being paid to complete a job to complete a task and is not being paid by the hour
5993450 if i hire a painter to paint my house im not supervising that persons every brush stroke
5993451 injuries by undocumented workers are usually covered by workers compensation
5993452 the concierge desk the porters the superintendents the maintenance people are all typically employees of the building
5993453 a lot of employees come up with phony claims a lot of doctors support the phony claims some employers take advantage and dont report everyone trying to save premiums and fees
5993454 i am proud to say that i am a g double e k
5993455 i just learned how to speak like american kids because they made fun of my scottish accent and i didnt want to be bullied when im back in the u k with scottish people i actually go back to my scottish accent
5993456 im of the star wars generation i love science fiction star trek the next generation battlestar galactica love em
5993457 i love every morning getting up to go to work because that little boy inside of me jumps with excitement every time i know im going to fight an alien or shoot a rocket gun or be on a spaceship or be with the doctor or get onto the tardis
5993458 so every time im working on it im really really happy
5993459 i always describe it as in season 1 we were learning how to walk and in season 2 were running
5993460 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important
5993461 but it should be one of his best episodes out of his career too he got to kiss me
5993462 the reason torchwood has gone down so well in america which tv executives should look at is the fact that their audience isnt uptight
5993463 its the executives who are treating the audience like theyre uptight because theyre pandering to programming for one specific audience and forgetting about everyone else out there
5993464 the stories have changed there are stories that people can actually relate to
5993465 a lot of people who argue that the stories are too risque theyre too in your face theyre too heavy for young people theyre afraid of dealing with those situations and theyre afraid of seeing real life on television what were doing is actually what people deal with in their everyday life we just do it in the realm of science fiction
5993466 i like the writers to create the story and create the fantasy for me so that i can then go and try to make it work but if im on set and were doing it and a director will ask me to do something that is completely out of context from what jack would do or what any of them would do we can actually say something
5993467 the producers trust enough and we know the characters well enough that we just know they wouldnt do or say something
5993468 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
5993469 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
5993470 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5993471 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
5993472 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
5993473 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
5993474 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
5993475 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
5993476 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
5993477 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
5993478 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
5993479 its not going to change its not a family show were still going to be on after 9pm torchwoods a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are
5993480 gt dropped out to be in the doubtless crappy law and order uk but thats just me now what do you think
5993481 with all due respect to cardiff city theres only so many options in a place of that size for stories compared to a huge city like london
5993482 but how many people are willing to make a commitment to watch something over five consecutive nights these days whats the dramatic point that cant be served by weekly episodes or are they relying on everyone recording it or iplayering it
5993483 if a person who has had a stroke can walk across a room i should be able to run 20 miles
5993484 when you run you delve a little deeper into yourself and empathize when they hit their wall and think i just cant do it
5993485 he is aging very gracefully healthy and smart much better than i did at his age he is national class
5993486 its training and leading up to a race for me
5993487 ive always had good pulmonary lung capacity its been my strength its carried me through a lot
5993488 it was kind of half hearted i was not prepared
5993489 i dont know exactly what it was that brought me back
5993490 thats a tough one a buddy of mine got me to run with him in the 2006 tucson 10 miler i did 1 07 and things snowballed from there
5993491 people who cant walk or dress themselves lots of stroke victims amputees hip fractures
5993492 i feel like a sore thumb in a piranha pool in this industry i dont like the way its all run by rich men in their 50s who went to private school its not something i want to be part of im going to retire and become a pedal taxi driver
5993493 victoria takes her position as a role model to young women very seriously and is horrified by this hurtful fabricated story it is now with her lawyers

5993496 jessicas time in the 200m breaststroke 2 55 59s is currently an aaaa time the highest u s junior swimming motivational standard and her time in the 100 breaststroke is an aaa slightly lower but is just 001s of the aaaa standard
5993497 jessi is one of the best swimmers there and her coach says that she is on track for the next olympics
5993498 at this rate jessi is reducing her time by ten seconds each year and we estimate that she should get the olympic qualifying time right on schedule
5993499 this trends also indicates an increasing demand for wamara logs in the chinese market since august 2007
5993500 this alone contributes to approximately 15 of all roundwood exports for the year owing to a higher demand for greenheart piles from the us plywood exports by volume on the other hand are showing some signs of improvement from the combined results for may and june levels with the us being the primary destination for exports
5993501 the quest by the guyana team for olympics glory at the xxix olympiad currently being held in beijing china came to an end earlier today when adam harris the final athlete to enter competition in beijing failed to qualify for the second round in the 200m race category this would have followed the earlier exits of niall roberts in the first round of the 50m freestyle swimming event and marian burnett similarly in the 800m athletics event
5993502 aliann pompey was quite impressive in getting through the first round in the 400m to book a place in the semi finals for that event in a time of 50 99s in the semi final heat however although improving her performance and emulating her personal best time of 50 93s in the event it was not sufficient to take her into the finals scheduled for tuesday evening at the national stadium beijing she is to be commended however for her valiant effort and of the 56 women who participated in the 400m alianns final ranking was 11th overall
5993503 we have in our possession no tickets for national events
5993504 kristian was a tough opponent he came out in the second game and started retrieving everything he started to put pressure on my backhand and i found myself playing his type of game

5993516 what were also seeing is for the people who dont like it generally just dont get it
5993517 and its because weve created something so innovative and different its ironic it just shows that human nature of if you dont understand something you immediately attack it its pretty interesting in that regard
5993518 the game plays a lot differently than other games in similar genres most people who give it a chance really like it but some people just dont
5993519 we started a small class in 2004 and received several hundred applicants from around the world
5993520 we thought that we should attract people from diverse academic and personal backgrounds irrespective of how much finance they might know it can be as exciting to teach physics and history majors as finance mbas as long as the class is full of bright committed and dedicated individuals we had never run a school before so it was probably our na vet that helped us to be successful
5993521 we created an extensive made from scratch curriculum with high quality faculty modules and simulations that help students in the real world and our a faculty coaches staff advisors and students taught us how to operate a great program
5993522 our challenge for all of these years has been to manage to the power of the swiss finance academy concept itself and to not bring the concept down to a lowest common denominator level or make it like a traditional university just for the sake of growth we are entrepreneurial and our approach to education must be innovative this educational philosophy has kept our brand and concept fresh constantly improving and exciting for four years and should continue to serve us well into the future at the same time our classes have attracted high caliber applicants and the academy has grown several folds
5993523 we have demonstrated that swiss finance academy is committed to excellence in all aspects of its programs and thats why our programs are so highly sought after by high performing students and professionals
5993524 on this special day for our academy we also want to express our sincere appreciation to our students faculty staff members suppliers as partners in our growth
5993525 we are convinced the next 4 years should be the best years ever for swiss finance academy
5993526 at this point in time i think this is one of the most cost effective ways to reach the largest number of potential customers
5993527 with some talented developers and a unique concept even a small company can launch a useful and or memorable application the challenge is creating an app that is unique and truly appeals to your target market ultimately the success of a branded app depends on its ability to deliver functionality that inspires the initial download encourages frequent and long term usage and creates a positive brand image
5993528 we realize how important perfecting the code is before launching a glitch in our first version resulted in some poor user reviews we now realize the obvious even if its a silly game an application is still an extension of ones brand getting everything right the first time is very important
5993529 our company is dedicated to providing quality products and service to our valued customers
5993530 we address the many diverse needs of todays customers by incorporating usability durability and style not to mention affordability for all of our products
5993531 many meetings in the past have not gone as planned because most conferencing services require software that might not get through firewalls or may violate corporate download restrictions

5993539 thats putting pressure on him hes not there to be pressured about his hair hes there to learn
5993540 if they would focus on educating him instead of how hes got to get his hair done maybe they wouldnt be confusing him
5993541 lead follow or get the he out of the way
5993542 we have to realise that it appears that torrential rain is going to occur on a more regular basis the weekend was no freak occurrence this means we have to introduce measures to adapt to this situation new strategies are needed to ensure that flash flooding is minimised and that a co ordinated emergency strategy is in place to cope with the consequences of flooding at the moment executive provisions in both these areas are woefully inadequate following the june 2007 floods there was much talk about improving the overall response to flooding however despite support at the time there has been a failure to introduce one telephone number for all cross departmental agencies equally there has been a failure to create a lead department to co ordinate the relevant agencies the current set up has led to confusion at local level with people not knowing which agency to contact adding to the disruption brought by flooding
5993543 with torrential downpours of rain now appearing to be a characteristic of northern ireland summers we have to stop treating such events as surprising or out of the ordinary
5993544 it really is wonderful to see the new hospital continuing to take shape recently minister mcgimpsey came down to enniskillen so see how things were developing and he was delighted with the progress that has been made just like tom elliott and myself minister mcgimpsey has supported the campaign for an acute services hospital in the county from the outset and we are now all extremely happy with how things are coming along there has never been any doubt in my mind that we needed the services retained especially when you take into consideration the rural spread of fermanagh
5993545 will provide the whole community with modern healthcare facilities fit for the 21st century
5993546 i have lived in county fermanagh all my life and the desire for a hospital in the area is something that is very real when people think back about the service of the erne hospital and its staff through the troubles including of course the enniskillen bomb you cannot underestimate the feeling of attachment there is to the medical services in this part of the world that is why i am delighted with the vision of the health minister and im sure that he will be keeping a close eye on future developments
5993547 i was deeply concerned to learn that there was a rocket attack on police officers in lisnaskea on saturday

5993583 at a time when republicans have heightened tensions within the assembly by their prolonged stalling tactics of executive decisions now i assume this incident is republicans continuing a terrorist campaign along the fermanagh border
5993584 it is their way of getting noticed their way of demonstrating their opposition to northern ireland and sending a message to the unionist people and indeed all the world that they have not gone away
5993585 the citizens of this province need to know the extent of the continued terrorist campaign and if this is being carried out with the blessing of the mainstream sinn fein ira movement and if some of their members are assisting with any dissident activity in the area
5993586 if there is not the resources within the current psni structure to deal with these incidents it may be necessary to deploy some army back onto the streets of this province we cannot allow an escalation of such terrorism to go unchecked
5993587 this area of fermanagh has suffered heinous terrorist activity during the past 40 years surely there is a need for these people to be allowed to enjoy some peace at this time
5993588 i trust the security services will have the full support of all within our community to free our society from these terrorist thugs
5993589 it should not be difficult in this new era of peace that all the sinn fein ministers martin mcguiness michelle gildernew conor murphy catriona ruane and gerry kelly are pressed to support the forces of law and order and would assist the authorities in bringing those responsible before the courts
5993590 it is now time that the security forces have the full support of all within our communities and all sinn fein ira must demonstrate that they would supply information to the psni to rid our society of terrorists

5993786 regardless of this debate the am oled market is set for strong growth over the next few years although volume shipments will be tiny compared to tft lcds
5993787 while mobile handsets are the obvious main target for the technology these phones require multiple sources of suppliers with sufficient volumes to meet demand its unlikely that a single company will be able to fulfill this demand in the short term because no supplier presently has sufficient capacity
5993788 if am oled makers want to stave off tft lcds advance in this arena they must continue to press their advantage on these fronts

5993843 we were looking for a way to get people to change their behavior

5993845 they dont even know theyre doing it because theyre having so much fun
5993846 we know that eating more fruits and vegetables combined with 60 minutes of moderate activity we dont use the e word can reduce risk of heart disease stroke diabetes
5993847 its the best pill on the market but how do we motivate people to change their behavior
5993848 but when i heard about this it just lit a fire what a perfect way to do something good with this excess weight that i have
5993849 before i started i took the kids to great america and just walking from the parking lot to the gate was hard for me i was not happy

5993858 leaving san jose anytime between 5 and 7 p m is just nuts
5993859 ive seen people get bumped a lot and its just going to get worse
5993860 were experiencing capacity problems on a lot of our trains during the peak and thats going to increase
5993861 its a happy problem to have but the bike riders are not the only ones
5993862 if we build all these alternatives and theyre still lining up getting bumped from the train all the time its not solving the problem
5993863 a stay at home mom who wanted to be a fashion designer someone who made all her kids halloween costumes of course that was me
5993864 shes bubbly and vocal and someone who really wanted it she had a passion and clearly a talent
5993865 i was treated like a star with my own driver and security guards who would clear the path for us by saying things like designers coming through but one thing i found out about a reality show is that its not reality at all
5993866 being asked to act surprised for four takes really qualifies more as acting doesnt it
5993867 she was hard to design for because shes very curvy
5993868 i dont want them to leave until the job is done
5993869 we need compromise here not everyone can get stuck in their ideology
5993870 i didnt find the meeting to be helpful in fact i think it was a little unhelpful

5993878 i think the same kind of places would have been right around 600 000 for one bedroom one bath loft condos
5993879 it was a waiting game for those to come down to my price range
5993880 values have dropped to a point where investors are coming in and buying those properties because they can get positive cash flow now

5993892 i hope he will be a regular over next two years but football is always a surprise
5993893 i think the first thing that one must take into account that a major event is something a bit different from combating crime in general
5993894 because you know a lot of the information the airport you know the routes you know where the accommodation will be you know where to a large degree people will go to restaurants clubs tourists attractions and you know where the stadium is
5993895 to a large degree your security plan is really based on a lot of known information
5993896 from the polices side alone we will deploy 41 000 police personnel but then take into account that we will have support from the south african national defence force for specific tasks
5993897 the committee has completed the second security appreciation for us and we have had a presentation in this regard so that long before the event we can get an idea of the security situation but also possible problems that we may experience
5993898 if one looks at major events that we have had in south africa we havent had a single incident during any one of those events
5993899 we have had various visits already to britain to see how they plan for their mechanisms the operation of their soccer intelligence we have a lot of experience in crowd management but hooliganism is something different
5993900 its not easy to give up smoking and because many people dont understand that nicotine is not harmful quite a lot of smokers attempt to quit using willpower alone unfortunately only three per cent of smokers who rely on willpower alone will successfully quit with the right support and treatment quitters can help double their chances of success
5993901 using niquitin when i was quitting was a massive help and im not sure if i would have come this far if it wasnt for the lozenges i quit with a mate who offered me huge support but combined with the lozenges its got to improve your chances of quitting successfully and for good popping one of these in my mouth when i get that urge for a cigarette takes away my craving and puts my mind on something else which is very important

5993996 unfortunately i think that the judge decisions were not mistakes but intentional and came at a crucial time when we were leading 6 2 in the second set and could have built up a lead
5993997 at the end of the sets in the most important periods they played more stable than us and deservedly won

5994001 the tragedy in all of this confrontation with russia is that the system thats proposed for poland and the czech republic is a scarecrow
5994002 its not something that europe can rely on it is not dependable if iran had missiles that could reach central europe which they dont yet this system couldnt be relied on to defend against them anyway
5994003 some of this may be just a threat but russia has shown in just the past week or so it has a formidable military force so if i were poland or the czech republic i would be more worried about russia than i would be about iran or north korea
5994004 for that reason no one who has good intentions toward us and toward the western world should be afraid of it
5994005 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent

5994021 nobody is crying that people who used to go around selling ice to people do not have a job anymore because of the fridge it would be stupid but it is the same thing
5994022 those questions are best left to the mccain campaign at this time
5994023 first if your instinct is to run on experience it doesnt hurt to have a vice president whos got it too
5994024 it would fit well into the narrative of his not having any politics in the white house
5994025 no more dick morris no more karl rove were governing here its an easy natural message for mccain and it implies a one term pledge without actually saying it
5994026 the question is on sept 15 or 25 is he in better shape or not
5994027 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5994028 that would be like obama picking some right winger that agrees with him on one thing
5994029 please keep senator mccain and his key advisers in your prayers as he nears a decision on his vp pick and please sign the petition and pass on to like minded pro lifers
5994030 you will not have a unanimous vote at the convention that much i can tell you
5994031 the drive bys are just hoping for it because they know the base will totally turn on mccain if this is the case
5994032 if he picks a pro choice running mate its not going to be pretty and the drive bys know it
5994033 the question is how to get the message to mccain
5994034 you dont get in mccains face and say dont do it
5994035 the last time i checked there was still a pro life plan in the platform so he needs to do some research i believe in where his party stands on the issue of life
5994036 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5994037 the way nato assesses the fulfillment of this condition is biased
5994038 they blame us as if there were no requirements for the georgian side in the six points i mean the requirements to bring back their troops to the places where they are on a permanent basis
5994039 mr carter said he is relatively happy with the outcome as he hadnt wanted the officer sacked however he is still pursuing compensation from the force
5994040 is the fact that the officer farooq filed a written complaint and charges against this man
5994041 they dont have the ability to do this sort of thing again
5994042 many thanks for a fabulous holiday good quality furnishings very comfortable beds best yet you appear to have thought of everything its the perfect holiday location
5994043 my sister and i have visited many villas in france over the years we found lamandier to be one of the best it was more like staying in someones well loved home more than renting a holiday villa we found the villa to be in an ideal location both in terms of visiting the area as well as being near to a boulangerie restaurants and local grocery shop all in all we had an excellent holiday

5994066 my whole career has been about resolving access issues this is my battle horse
5994067 private delivery is an accepted practice everywhere in the world and its time canada accepted this reality
5994068 the concern is basically for a loss of effect for drugs and particularly those used in serious medical conditions
5994069 these are three serious medical conditions for which the drugs simply have to work properly
5994070 im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
5994071 and we have only a very rudimentary understanding of what these pumps do and what drugs they affect and what other drugs or foods might modulate these pumps
5994072 theres a lot of uncertainty in terms of what the implications are for the average person
5994073 the best thing to do in general to get the most consistent effect of your drug is to take it with a glass of water on an empty stomach
5994074 its hard to formulate a generic recommendation that fits everybody other than be aware of the fact that food and grapefruit in particular can influence how your body handles drugs

5994084 i was reminded about an article that i read in this months the gatekeeper making friends with pain where top runners were asked how they deal with or distract themselves from the pain of running
5994085 that guy might deserve to get hit by a car
5994086 ryanair welcomes the competition commissions comprehensive report into the market power of the baa monopoly and fully endorses its findings
5994087 competition works monopolies dont baas monopoly control over the london airports has been highly detrimental to competition and consumers
5994088 baa has long ignored the needs of its airline users and the travelling public and provided inefficient gold plated facilities encouraged by an ineffectual regulator the caa
5994089 the competition commissions provisional findings today highlight one point loud and clear passengers are being left at the back of a very long queue when it comes to interests served
5994090 whatever options the commission finally proposes heathrow will still be subject to the same out dated regulation that has failed the passenger first time round
5994091 introducing greater competition through selling off gatwick or stansted wont necessarily solve that conundrum heathrow will still be running to stand still with too much demand for the airport to satisfy and operating at 99pc capacity
5994092 heathrow regulation needs a complete overhaul then and only then will better customer service mean putting the passenger interest first
5994093 the commissions findings state that the lack of runway capacity is a main reason for what it calls the current poor standards of service and the lack of resilience at times of disruption which results in regular delays
5994094 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying that delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely

5994101 not too long ago no one cared very much where all of dish washing suds ended up of course now we know that what we put in the trash and down the drain has a direct impact on the environment and eventually on our quality of life green works has joined with the sierra club in support of their efforts to sierra club logo additionally the epa has recognized the dish soap for using environmentally preferred chemistry with their logo also proudly displayed on the bottle as it arrives nationwide this august green works dishwashing liquid comes in five scents original water lily tangerine free amp clear and simply lemon as with the rest of the line the dish soap retains cloroxs well known ability to cut through grease and baked on food while using all natural plant based ingredients like coconuts and lemon oil making the soap sustainable and biodegradable
5994102 five villages have been flooded and the residents have been evacuated
5994103 we think people may have been killed but we have not been able to verify the number
5994104 five villages have been flooded and the residents have been evacuated
5994105 the federation council is ready to recognise the independent status of south ossetia and abkhazia if that is what the people of these republics want and also if there is a corresponding decision by the russian president
5994106 there has been some effort to make it appear it was capable of exploding but it was found to be inert
5994107 it was general in nature and referred to the item being a bomb
5994108 we are certainly appealing for members of the public to come forward if they have information in relation to the person responsible
5994109 it appears to be an isolated incident not linked to any other threat
5994110 the children were not living in the bin but had been using it as a cubby house and the car park as a play area
5994111 docs caseworkers are assessing if there are any ongoing concerns about the welfare of the children
5994112 the terrain is well suited to the establishment of the required facilities and this bodes well for project development
5994113 we are delighted to see the logistics of this coal project exceeding our expectations and that the delivery of the pre feasibility study remains on schedule which will enable us to continue to move forward with the project
5994114 at this early stage we remain confident in our ability to readily deliver production from daguma to the coast for transport to export markets
5994115 continue to point out to the commission the many areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies would be disproportionate and counterproductive
5994116 we are doing everything we can to help first time buyers purchase a new home
5994117 the incentives we have in place for those purchasing these properties will make the first year far easier for buyers to cope with as they settle into their new home and we hope this will give some much needed hope to those who still want to buy a brand new home of their own
5994118 this really is the best deal on the market today
5994119 additionally despite negative media stories one hundred per cent mortgages are still available for purchasers of new build homebuy properties and with no stamp duty to pay you dont even need to have built up a large amount of savings before you can buy your home
5994120 going live with the service was almost immediate the process was simple and seamless meaning we had access to a new housing option within a few short days
5994121 having used homeswapper for a couple of months our staff cannot be more enthusiastic about the service and its ease of use in our opinion homeswapper offers the best local and national mutual exchange
5994122 by partnering with homeswapper co uk we have gained the benefits of an efficient and easy to follow online service but we have also been able to help customers without an internet connection by still offering a paper based registration system that allows us to search the database on their behalf
5994123 the new homeswapper service really does enable our tenants to find a mutual exchange more quickly and successfully
5994124 the children were not living in the bin but had been using it as a cubby house and the car park as a play area
5994125 docs caseworkers are assessing if there are any ongoing concerns about the welfare of the children
5994126 we wanted to mark actions 30th birthday but also to celebrate all the good work that everyone does for our communities in chesterfield
5994127 you never hear about all the people out there who are working together to help the people who need it the most and this was our chance to come together and say a big thank you
5994128 pulling this party together was a tremendous challenge for our service user group but theyve shown us exactly what can be achieved when people get the help and support they need
5994129 the gala was great fun for the entire town but it was also about highlighting the importance of good local support services for the people who need them as well as the importance of organisations to work together in ensuring everyone gets a fair stab at life
5994130 smokestack is not the best bbq in the city but it is rather good
5994131 there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports this is evident from its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity

5994135 weve also said the green energy has to be in addition to victorias existing renewable energy targets and those two commitments make it very clear that it will be additional green power that is sourced to meet the governments commitments
5994136 and i think that shows the governments credibility in ensuring the impact of this plant is minimised
5994137 every time we make a commitment to build something like this that increases emissions we are going a step backwards
5994138 the government made the decision to go ahead with it so they are not going to come up with an ees that says its not a goer it was a fait accompli
5994139 no long term or irreversible damage to the environment from the project has been identified

5994142 the company estimates that its available cash is sufficient to support its day to day operations through to the end of september 2008
5994143 it therefore needs to raise significant additional capital to fund its clinical trials and other operating activities and to repay indebtedness
5994144 will have a material adverse effect on the company financial position and operations
5994145 special constables and police support volunteers are a vital part of our modern police service
5994146 every day of the week specials are making a real difference responding to peoples concerns and making communities safer places to live the funding i am announcing today will ensure that the special constabulary can grow and continue their outstanding work
5994147 the nine new regional co ordinators will drive forward a more targeted approach to the recruitment and development of special constables
5994148 they will work closely with the local forces and the acpo regional leads to identify need and provide solutions to enable more people to become involved and contribute to the policing of their communities through the role of special constable
5994149 given all these matters i am satisfied that there are special circumstances
5994150 they also support a conclusion that there is no risk of flight

5994161 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
5994162 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
5994163 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
5994164 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
5994165 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can

5994169 the difference is that training is the acquisition of skills and knowledge as a result of being taught while education is the acquisition of skills and knowledge as a result of learning a more rounded think for yourself ideal
5994170 but because the older universities arent doing theirs were getting too few educated people
5994171 we also see games as ai economics psychology sociology therapy training theres nothing wrong with this but were seeing games for everything except for games
5994172 where will the games industry be if the only public money available is for games as anything but games
5994173 when our american friends tell us its the middle east which is the most likely area of proliferation and nuclear chemical and biological weapons theyre not
5994174 its asia that has the most potent latent capabilities to develop nuclear chemical and biological weapons
5994175 thats because of the advance of their economies and industrial base
5994176 japan goes nuclear only if it loses confidence in the american alliance
5994177 and if japan develops a nuclear weapon china would immediately proliferate a number of ballistic missiles and warheads and whats the betting south korea would develop a nuclear weapon
5994178 youve got no arms control or disarmament agreements worth talking about
5994179 i dont detect any great interest in the region to have this conversation
5994180 thats 684 000 years the equivalent of 60 people playing the game 24 hours a day since the last ice age 11 400 years ago
5994181 considering we tried to sell bejeweled outright to more than one industry giant back in the early days of our company and got no takers even after reducing our asking price to 60 000 this little game has done all right for itself
5994182 the game has changed and the way the game is played has to be changed
5994183 oh geez we need to make the game length shorter
5994184 i have invested 10 hours in this game and i am almost done
5994185 look i got a gold medal wow i must be really getting good at this game
5994186 oh well what about those old school games like r type which took time invested to learn

5994191 there has been some effort to make it appear it was capable of exploding but it was found to be inert
5994192 it was general in nature and referred to the item being a bomb
5994193 we are certainly appealing for members of the public to come forward if they have information in relation to the person responsible
5994194 it appears to be an isolated incident not linked to any other threat
5994195 the challenge for west virginia the challenge for coal producing states and nations is that as historically produced coal is a dirty fuel and is regarded as a dirty fuel
5994196 and there are environmental issues associated with the production and consumption of coal
5994197 if you want to do energy well in an environmentally sound fashion go to west virginia go to appalachia
5994198 we all win in that equation thats our great opportunity
5994199 the physically reality is that we cannot bridge to the future for decades if not hundreds of years without coal as part of the equation
5994200 if you accept that premise then your choices are how do we do coal well how do we do coal clean how do we capture the opportunities for coal
5994201 carbon sequestration is going to double the cost of coal fired power
5994202 one of the coal presidents said it is at least 15 maybe 20 years away from being commercially viable
5994203 there are a myriad of legal issues that are unresolved whos going to take the liability if it comes back out of the ground and the energy it takes ive heard estimates it could take 15 or 20 of the power of the power plant makes to strip out the co 2 thats going to raise the cost of electricity
5994204 im not sure that we can really appease the individuals that want to see coal eliminated abolished from the energy mix of this country
5994205 but those individuals and groups that have concerns about the environment or the impacts of mining certainly we can be more responsive to those concerns
5994206 right now we dont have a comprehensive bill out there
5994207 we havent been allowed to vote on anything that i think is going to address high gasoline prices and dependence on foreign oil and any time we do get something its a fight to get anything related to coal in there
5994208 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
5994209 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
5994210 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
5994211 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
5994212 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
5994213 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
5994214 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
5994215 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
5994216 anastacia and i have worked together for many years and i am thrilled to have her join the mercury universal family
5994217 it has been incredible to witness her growth and success thus far and we feel her best is yet to come with heavy rotation
5994218 i called the album heavy rotation because its a phrase that originated with djs
5994219 and also for me the meaning is life can be heavy but it all turns around and goes into something else it seemed to be the perfect title for where im at in my life

5994229 weve also said the green energy has to be in addition to victorias existing renewable energy targets and those two commitments make it very clear that it will be additional green power that is sourced to meet the governments commitments
5994230 and i think that shows the governments credibility in ensuring the impact of this plant is minimised
5994231 every time we make a commitment to build something like this that increases emissions we are going a step backwards
5994232 the government made the decision to go ahead with it so they are not going to come up with an ees that says its not a goer it was a fait accompli
5994233 no long term or irreversible damage to the environment from the project has been identified
5994234 it just came away from the wall because it had been fitted with the wrong types of screw it had been put up with tiny ones instead of large ones
5994235 it knocked me down at 10pm and it was only when the man from the meals and wheels service came round at noon the following day that i was able to get any help
5994236 unfortunately i wasnt wearing my panic button so i wasnt able to summon any help until he arrived at my flat it was an absolutely awful experience and i still havent got over it
5994237 i cant go out ive got problems with my nervous system and its all because of this incident
5994238 it was a very difficult case to win but we managed to settle out of court

5994241 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5994242 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5994243 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5994244 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5994245 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
5994246 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
5994247 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
5994248 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
5994249 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
5994250 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
5994251 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
5994252 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
5994253 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
5994254 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
5994255 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
5994256 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
5994257 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
5994258 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
5994259 i want you to recognize that this jar represents your life the golf balls are the important things your family your children your health your friends and your favorite passions and if everything else was lost and only they remained your life would still be full
5994260 there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls the same goes for life if you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff you will never have room for the things that are important to you
5994261 pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness spend time with your children spend time with your parents visit with grandparents take time to get medical checkups take your spouse out to dinner play another 18 there will always be time to clean the house and fix the disposal take care of the golf balls first the things that really matter set your priorities the rest is just sand
5994262 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
5994263 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
5994264 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
5994265 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
5994266 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
5994267 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
5994268 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
5994269 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
5994270 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
5994271 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
5994272 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
5994273 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
5994274 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
5994275 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
5994276 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
5994277 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
5994278 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
5994279 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
5994280 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
5994281 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
5994282 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
5994283 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
5994284 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
5994285 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5994286 ich denke dass ich meine karriere in italien beenden werde in italien bin ich bei 99 toren angelangt ich w rde gerne auf 100 in der serie a kommen es ist noch zeit ich habe noch viele jahre

5994289 so perfekt so makellos dass es fast schon wieder langweilig ist manchmal sucht man ja nach einem schwachpunkt nach etwas weniger perfektem aber hier funktioniert einfach alles
5994290 aber zwischen den trainingseinheiten bin ich manchmal zu m de oder ich habe noch andere verpflichtungen sponsoren gegen ber oder bin auf reisen mehr noch als die zeit braucht man den kopf um zu lernen deshalb ist es schwierig einen tag zu finden an dem alles passt

5994303 are you ok do i need to call a doctor

5994309 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
5994310 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5994311 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5994312 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5994313 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5994314 http www nasa gov home hqnews 2008 aug hq 08 205 constellation realignment html
5994315 the constellation program is developing the spacecraft and systems including the ares i and ares v rockets the orion crew exploration vehicle and the altair lunar lander that will take astronauts to the international space station after the retirement of the space shuttle and eventually return humans to the moon
5994316 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
5994317 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
5994318 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
5994319 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
5994320 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
5994321 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
5994322 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
5994323 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
5994324 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
5994325 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
5994326 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5994327 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5994328 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5994329 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5994330 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5994331 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5994332 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
5994333 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him

5994365 the presumptive democratic presidential nominee will announce his running mate
5994366 serene self confidence even arrogance would likely add a necessary dash of bareknuckle candor to obamas high road bid
5994367 by selecting the pro choice ridge as his running mate mccain would a appeal to moderate swing voters b extend an olive branch to pro choice former clintonistas dissatisfied with obama c reinforce his perceived edge over the democratic nominee in the experience and foreign policy departments and d have a shot at competing in pennsylvania

5994369 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz

5994405 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5994406 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5994407 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5994408 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
5994409 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
5994410 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
5994411 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
5994412 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5994413 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5994414 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5994415 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5994416 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5994417 a lot of companies are unaware of where their catalogue paper comes from
5994418 we want to work with them and pressure them to do the right thing by adopting sustainable policies
5994419 at first they werent responsive but then they saw how it would benefit them
5994420 consumer opinion has a lot of power to influence companies
5994421 we continue to work within the supply chain to promote certification of forests and fibre and we are engaged with our suppliers to continuously improve on our prudent use of natural resources
5994422 sears has yet to make any policy changes so well continue to lobby them
5994423 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5994424 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5994425 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5994426 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5994427 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5994428 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5994429 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5994430 bidens son is a lawyer who would be nowhere near the front lines
5994431 for mccains son it was either the army or jail thats why mccain rarely mentions he son in iraq
5994432 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president
5994433 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because her father is janet reno
5994434 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
5994435 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5994436 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
5994437 you would want the actor to sound kind of like it but it would feel weird to just be completely different i think
5994438 i think what we are mainly responding to david and i is the will of the fans which is really telling us that they want to see a scary chucky movie again they want to go back to the straightforward horror rather than the horror comedy
5994439 i think it has the potential to be scarier than the original based on the stuff we are talking about which i know sounds very mysterious and abstract but anyone in our position would say that at this point but as you pointed out we do have the advantage of being the people who created the franchise in the first place
5994440 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5994441 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5994442 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5994443 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5994444 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america

5994469 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5994470 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5994471 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited

5994475 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5994476 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5994477 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5994478 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5994479 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action

5994490 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5994491 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5994492 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5994493 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5994494 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5994495 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5994496 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5994497 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them

5994600 su questo punto vorrei proporre una riflessione levento iniziato all 17 30 e dopo una breve introduzione del progetto da parte di un sempre impegnatissimo
5994601 for eight years weve had a vice president who stayed in undisclosed locations trust me its already change we can believe in its just the next vice presidents identity thats undisclosed
5994602 the institutional culture of corruption embraced by the clinton leadership of the democratic party
5994603 unaccountable power for the clintons at the expense of the rule of law and respect for the constitutional processes of government
5994604 especially since it was days after she said she wouldnt take any more money from me
5994605 sen obama needs someone experienced in foreign policy and or running a state or corporation joe biden would be good
5994606 she has the perfect place for a republican platform the washingtonpost com

5994612 menneskenaturens tilb yelighet til svinge fra en ytterlighet frykt til en annen overoptimisme
5994613 ved at det til n har foreligget bindinger p det kortsiktige renteniv et har det v rt n dvendig at norges bank i 1986 har finansiert det innenlandske penge og kredittmarkedet i stort omfang derfor har man heller ikke i 1986 kunnet f re en stram kredittpolitikk som har kunnet gi den reduksjon i faktisk kredittettersp rsel og kredittilgang en tok sikte p
5994614 ja jeg g r ut fra at det selvf lgelig ogs er statskirke her oppe
5994615 jo jeg antar at vi p en m te kan si det
5994616 ja for her finnes vel ingen private frimenigheter eller konservative teologer

5994628 i norge har vi valgt en samfunnsmodell der vi finansierer de viktigste samfunnsoppgavene i fellesskap
5994629 det andre valget handler om hvorvidt vi skal l se oppgavene i fellesskap eller om den enkelte skal overlates mer til seg selv
5994630 et tredje veivalg handler om vi vil ha et organisert arbeidsliv og sikring av arbeidstakeres rettigheter eller om dette er rettigheter som skal bygges ned

5994635 how is obama going to lose when he will get so much more votes in november than john mcbush
5994636 if anwr is so small and so filled with oil why not slant drill into it do you really think that the only oil in alaska is directly under anwr seriously
5994637 you do know that the oil companies are only drilling on a fraction of the land they currently have leases for why is that maybe because there are no more rigs to send out no more ships to transport and no more capacity at the refineries we have today have you thought of that phil
5994638 i guess since you are so well versed on oil recovery why do they lease so many acres and only find it on a miniscule percentage they have 68 million acres that have no oil on it
5994639 why do they lease so many acres and only find it on a miniscule percentage
5994640 iraq and afghanistan were supposed to instill fear in the mighty american war machine and make the terrorists think twice about attacking us instead the bush mccain war plan has made us the laughing stock of the planet and emboldened the enemy we have zero credibility we now are the torturers we are the ones with secret ussr like prisons we are the ones who refuse fair trials we are the ones who spy on our own citizens this is what obama brings to the table if its change from bush mccain failed policies thats all we need
5994641 oil drilling in anwr would not impact the u s oil supply for at least a decade
5994642 the opening of anwr would reduce the price of imported low sulfur light crude oil by only 0 75 per barrel in 2025
5994643 oh yeah there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq
5994644 im saving the word pelosi realization that democratic seats would be lost if she didnt bring off shore drilling up to a vote

5994656 the main risk would be that an unexpected rate rise might adversely affect business and consumer confidence adding to the near term downside pressures on activity and causing a material undershoot of the inflation target in the medium term although rates could be cut later in that event the downturn would be unnecessarily deep adding to the volatility in the economy

5994660 id have to say its a tie between michael jordan and tiger woods
5994661 jordan has the ability to be a closer the person everyone on his team can count on when the team needs a shot at the buzzer id like to think the three other people i am swimming with can count on me in the same way
5994662 has the ability to drown out all distraction and focus in on the moment i feel like i am in a similar situation in swimming since swimming is an individual sport how you perform can impact only you

5994664 its not so she can be the greatest athlete for her own selfish reasons but so she can deliver hope to a younger generation
5994665 of course it is the case when you have high profile and disturbing cases that people question and i for example question officials about what restrictions we have on board on people being able to travel abroad to abuse children cases like this identify the questions we should be asking and the improvements that we should be making

5994710 many organisations have headcount statistics which do not support part time working or job sharing someone working three days out of five is not three fifths of a full headcount the benefits costs are often the same for example healthcare cover therefore more part timers or atypical arrangements directly feed into greater headcount at a time when many employers are looking to reduce headcount and save costs

5994717 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5994718 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5994719 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
5994720 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
5994721 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
5994722 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
5994723 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
5994724 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
5994725 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
5994726 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
5994727 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
5994728 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
5994729 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
5994730 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue it is immoral to keep kicking this can down the road for younger generations to grapple with its time for real action rather than more rhetoric
5994731 i know theres no one who knows the subject matter that hes going to have to deal with better than john
5994732 his attitude toward the environment at pennfuture has been very angry
5994733 i think id characterize some of his views as extreme
5994734 theres no one i trust more than mary jo white in striking a balance
5994735 helped shape bills that were both tremendously positive for pennsylvania businesses and at the same time good for our environment
5994736 he starts off with some positives and starts off with a few negatives but i think he can work his way toward confirmation
5994737 i know exactly the difference between being an advocate in the private sector and having a public responsibility
5994738 whats important is working hard listening to everyone considering different views and trying to arrive at fair productive answers
5994739 view of economic development is through regulation litigation and taxation theyve supported so many taxes against our members i think the appointment is a concern for us
5994740 were certainly hopeful that the secretary designate despite the constituency he most recently represented will be able to shift gears and represent a broader constituency that includes us
5994741 all of these things are just incredibly expensive to the public while yielding almost no environmental benefit
5994742 if you cant compete with petroleum at 120 a barrel you cant compete
5994743 the whole concept of state government playing around in venture capital is nonsense
5994744 i think hes done an excellent job leading pennfuture and i think hell transfer all that experience and passion to his new position
5994745 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
5994746 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
5994747 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
5994748 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
5994749 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods

5994753 ive looked down the barrel of an m 16 at an enemy of our nation put him in my sights and squeezed the trigger you never have and anyone anyone who thinks ill do any less to our enemies today knows nothing about who i really am
5994754 how do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake
5994755 seemed to be a step backwards towards confusion rather than a progress towards resolution
5994756 i am really amazed that the nobel peace prize has been given on scientifically incorrect conclusions by people who are not geologists
5994757 the ipcc has actually become a closed circuit it doesnt listen to others it doesnt have open minds
5994758 when i put forward my points in the morning some ipcc official got up to say that what i was saying was nonsense see when we have that sort of attitude that sort of dogma against a scientific observation that would not actually end up in very very positive debate we should maintain our sense of proportion maintain our sense of objectivity allow a discussion not have fixed mindset about global warming
5994759 i think the scientific community is putting way too much faith on these models especially given the fact that they have not been able to predict 5 day weather forecasts yet and weather systems are simpler than the climate and every 5 days they have a chance to test the model and improve it
5994760 a lot of the predictions made by modelers and models do not match very well to the longer term geologic record and even more scary most atmospheric scientists are not aware of that
5994761 we know temperature goes up and down we know there is tremendous amount of natural variations but for how many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand we politicians and scientists that the planet is not warming for how many years must cooling go on
5994762 retailers are mature enough in this industry that they understand that consumers will visit their web sites before they ever visit the store
5994763 ninety percent of consumers go online to research before they buy that makes it even more important to have your brand replicated online because millions of people a day can come and check out your web site
5994764 were probably better friends today after two ventures than we were as kids thats pretty rare
5994765 well ah ah i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
5994766 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5994767 this is something that i have not i think come to a firm resolution on i think its very hard to know what that means when life begins is it when a cell separates is it when the soul stirs so i dont presume to know the answer to that question what i know as ive said before is that there is something extraordinarily powerful about potential life and that has a moral weight to it that we take into consideration when were having these debates

5994781 nixon was bad enough without fictionalizing him and demonizing him
5994782 when it comes to predicting hurricane intensity the curve in the last 40 years has been somewhat flat with little advance in how to reduce error in predicted intensity
5994783 this is a good thing because these are the storms that produce the most damage
5994784 ostm jason 2 will help us to keep the necessary coverage that we need to identify ocean features that can be linked to tropical cyclone intensification because with only one satellite we may miss some of them
5994785 satellite data play the crucial role of verifying tsunami models by testing real tsunami events
5994786 if an earthquake generates a tsunami does the satellite data match observations on the ground and model predictions
5994787 one of the unique pieces of satellite observations is the large scale perspective
5994788 the biggest value in satellite measurements of sea surface height is not in direct warning capability but in improving models so when an earthquake is detected you can make reliable predictions and reduce damage to property and people

5994794 so why would a landlord want to rent out to the nigerian teacher who barely is even assured of a salary at the end of the month

5994816 americans say repeatedly in surveys that they care about the income and wealth gaps what they need is a politician who cares right now obama and mccain treat the gap as a third rail as if to talk about it invites candidacy killing charges of socialism the candidate who touches the rail first just might discover that it delivers the jolt he needs to get to the white house
5994817 we are aware of the hospitals space constraints due to rising numbers of patients
5994818 we often hear of complaints from patients on the poor service at hospitals both in rural and urban areas

5994825 because of the cost of making the playstation 3 and because they sold it at a loss sony basically has pretty much no chance of making money on the ps3 because its lost more money than they made during the entire peak of the playstation 2 its not going to happen again for sony
5994826 if they release the playstation 4 and have an even more expensive console and raise the cost of games by ten dollars that would not be good
5994827 so this is going to force them to make the ps3 last longer and theyre kind of positioning to do that

5995055 google is attempting to expand its influence over the political process to help it achieve its commercial goals
5995056 google likes to bask in self congratulatory rhetoric claiming it has the publics interests at heart its all about accessing peoples data for targeted marketing
5995057 in this us election year what information could be more important than the candidates own words to describe their views actions and platforms
5995058 as idealistic as that sounds is as idealistic as we are it is exciting all around not just for google
5995059 this new politics is disruptive upsetting old arrangements and displacing people invested in the old ways

5995061 thanks to continued focus we have managed to keep spending in the first half of 2008 within the guidance given in march this year due to the build up of commercial capabilities we expect cash spending on operating activities in the second half of 2008 to be around chf 4 5 million on average per month based on our financial position and iclaprims advanced development status we feel we are well placed as we approach 2009 which we expect to be a launch year

5995072 he gambari must do what he should do after meeting with burmese officials and the opposition he should give frank accounts to the public
5995073 for example if the junta is stubborn and doesnt want to negotiate he must frankly report that so the un can clearly understand the issues
5995074 we only knew that gambari came to burma and went back
5995075 we dont know whether he would like a chance to meet with us or not
5995076 we heard that he will meet with opposition leaders and ethnic leaders so we are hoping to meet him and we are ready to discuss issues with him as well we are now waiting for him but we havent heard whether he will meet us
5995077 the release of political prisoners will be the benchmark by which gambari and ban ki moon will be judged
5995078 its a normal first step when a country enters into political reform
5995079 if the regime is genuine about their claims they will reform they should release all political prisoners immediately
5995080 the united nations security council has said the political prisoners should be released and gambari and ban ki moon must make that happen

5995235 officials concerned are working through the process of putting him on the plane to take him out of the country but if he continues to refuse to leave then he will confined in the airport transit area temporarily before being taken into a detention centre
5995236 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
5995237 i dont want any sex offenders in this country but the point is vietnamese officials have deported him to the uk so as we do whenever sex offenders return to this country we need to plan for what happens when people return
5995238 never mind his individual case anybody who is returning to the uk in these sorts of circumstances would be met at the airport by police officers would be served with an order which effectively puts them on to the sex offenders register
5995239 one of the things we have learned generally about sex offenders is they do want to travel to places where they can exploit children
5995240 if there is evidence the person is travelling abroad to abuse children we can get an order that stops them travelling there should be more of those
5995241 in every single case the court has to make the decision but this is the type of case where i find it pretty hard to imagine it is legitimate for him to travel abroad again
5995242 i think its right that we use police time to monitor sex offenders
5995243 if you are a british citizen you have the right to use the nhs whatever we think about an individual and this is a pretty despicable person
5995244 the last information we have is that shortly before the flight to the uk departed he declined to board
5995245 he decides where he applies to go and the country or authorities there will decide whether they permit him to enter their territory

5995250 the most important manhattan projects of the future will be vast government sponsored enquiries sic into what the politicians and the participating scientists will call the problem of happiness in other words the problem of making people love their servitude
5995251 t his is indeed the will o the wisp pursued throughout the twentieth century in forced schooling not intellectual development not character development but the inculcation of a new synthetic culture in children one designed to condition its subjects to a continual adjusting of their lives by unseen authorities
5995252 the american state assumed the parens patriae powers of old time absolute kings the notion of the political state as the primary father
5995253 and there were signs it intended to use those powers to synthesize the type of scientific family it wanted for the society it wanted to usher in the future it wanted
5995254 here is the crux of the difference between education and schooling
5995255 the former turns on independence knowledge ability comprehension and integrity the latter upon obedience
5995256 homeschoolers are tremendously loyal as family members they are suspicious of television and other less intimate influences they eat as a family they socialize as a family they attend church as a family they become members of an extended homeschooling community

5995258 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father
5995259 you know about years ago the lord just changed our hearts about children and we just started saying yes
5995260 it just made sense to us that if children are a heritage from the lord we didnt want to refuse any
5995261 you know it is the hardest work ive ever done but i cant think of anything else id rather pour my life into than raising children for the glory of god
5995262 you know we have found the most incredible thing to be true when we make it our priority to teach our children about the lord the fear of the lord etc the only thing he even asks of us the academic part flourishes
5995263 and this is how you put your fingers on the piano mom
5995264 um mom i think alex might need some help he is yelling at his fingers
5995265 yes maam he is mad because they wont do what they are supposed to do on the piano
5995266 suppressing a desire to giggle i asked my son to come into my room
5995267 because they wont do what they are supposed to do
5995268 one day that means your fingers have had only one day to learn what they are supposed to do they still dont know where theyre supposed to go they havent learned how to stay still and how to hit the piano keys nicely and stay put when theyve finished do they
5995269 how do you think your fingers will learn to play the piano alex
5995270 alex it took my hands eight years to learn to play the piano and i still dont play as well as daddy does he has played far longer than that he has practiced and practiced and played and played and thats how his fingers remember what to do
5995271 how do you think daddy taught his fingers to play
5995272 do you think daddy got mad at his fingers and told them they wouldnt be allowed to play piano until they could do it perfectly

5995336 whereas chavez has championed radical anti capitalist policies and sought to move venezuela backward lula has proved to be a pragmatic market friendly modernizer it is the lula model that has far greater appeal throughout the region after all what has chavez really done for venezuela although the full extent of his mismanagement has been camouflaged by high energy prices which have been a boon to the oil rich country he is wrecking the venezuelan economy the healthcare system has deteriorated alarmingly and food shortages remain a persistent problem corruption is widespread and rampant crime has earned caracas its reputation as the most dangerous city in the western hemisphere meanwhile ch vez has eroded venezuelan democracy and sought to create an authoritarian governing structure
5995337 in the united states of america and in great britain there is civilized debate and disputation on vital issues of the day the month the year and the decade are widely circulated with the contributors largely restrained and polite without being at all dull this form of exploration of important human topics began back in ancient greece and was carried on in rome more or less consistently although often surrounded by overt violence and intimidation and of course in many parts around the globe today discussions of such vital topics has a hard time being carried out in a civil tongue the threat of bayonets and bombs is altogether real should someone in the minority annoy an opponent too severely however the influence of modern classical liberal ideas especially as regards public affairs has been to at least compartmentalize the conflicts so that where ideas are discussed weapons are barred the progress this exhibits must not be over nor underestimated a few steps forward can easily be obliterated by a few backwards
5995338 a month ago fannie mae had plummeted from 70 a share over the past year to roughly 8 a share today its opening at just over 6 a share freddie mac was also down from roughly 60 a share a year ago to about 4 40 last month today its opening at 4 16 and it is likely going to go down even more thus the vaunted bailout plans announced by the government have done nothing to slow the overall downward trend this is significant because everyone except for those of us who are opposed to the federal reserves fiat monetary system seems to be counting on the government bailout to well bail em out and yet its not working the markets after initially responding positively have resumed their negative slide

5995340 pakistan is currently governed by a two party coalition which took power in parliament after elections this february the coalition has been unified around little more than hatred of musharraf its leaders asif ali zardari and nawaz sharif detest each other they cooperated only to force musharraf from office and will now vie for power zardari is the widower of former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto who was assassinated in december zardaris party the pakistan peoples party is center left and generally pro western zardari himself feels no sympathy for the islamists and favors the continuation of musharrafs policies sharif head of the muslim league n and a former prime minister of pakistan it was he whom musharraf ousted in 1999 is by comparison more sympathetic to the radicals he would not likely abandon musharrafs pro u s orientation entirely but could not be counted upon as an ally there is nothing the u s can do to influence the outcome of the contest between zardari and sharif but our hopes should attach to the former unfortunately both are typical pakistani politicians what this means is that in practice they are likely to be corrupt and incompetent

5995342 it may seem obvious that easier divorce laws make for more divorce and more insecurity but what is obvious is not necessarily true what two scholars have found is that when you make divorce easier to get you may actually produce better marriages in the old days anyone who wanted to escape from the trials of wedlock had to get his or her spouse to agree to a split or else go to court to prove the partner had done something terribly wrong such as committing adultery the 1960s and 70s brought no fault divorce which is also known as unilateral divorce since either party can bring it about without the consent of the other the first surprise is that looser divorce laws have actually had little effect on the number of marriages that fall apart
5995343 i have been having an interesting usenet conversation on the subject of economic relations between finland and russia in the postwar period the facts almost everyone agrees on are finland started by paying russia a large sum in reparations thereafter trade was conducted as barter with an accounting system to keep track of which country owed how much to which russians provided finns with raw materials especially oil at a price said to be somewhat below the current world price finns provided russians with a variety of manufactured items it isnt clear how the prices were determined no money was actually supposed to change hands at the end of the period when the soviet union collapsed it turned out that the soviets owed quite a lot to the finns russia has now paid off the debt

5995346 the us government has set itself up as the guarantor of all things bad the lender of last resort and the great insurer against all calamities in the downward side of the business cycle the government is bailing out homeowners lenders and speculators taxpayer are gifted with government rebate checks all this is done with borrowed money while billions are also borrowed to wage war the us government can spend lavishly with borrowed funds because the usas debt has been considered maximally safe united states treasury bonds are the benchmark of safety all risks are relative to t bonds the us federal government thus enjoys a zero risk premium on its debt in contrast to corporations that must pay extra to get buyers to hold corporate bonds rather than federal debt
5995347 futures markets exist to permit commercial interests to hedge their business risks for a fee a farmer or oil producer can put a floor under the price at which his product will sell the forward price is normally a bit lower than the current price but the contract protects the farmer from a catastrophic price slump such as may occur in for instance bumper years speculators buy the futures on the chance that the market price will be substantially higher they make a respectable profit on what is in effect an insurance function and a killing in years of drought flood and war this system works reasonably well so long as speculators do not actually control or manipulate prices for if they can drive prices way up they can obviously cash in while the farmer who has presold his crop cannot

5995350 the coal river wind project is ambitious coal river mountain watch proposes to put 220 wind turbines each 292 feet high that combined could generate 440 megawatts across miles of the mountain at a cost of upward of 1 billion a study by windlogics appalachian voices and wind farm campaign coordinator rory mcilmoil 28 who has studied and analyzed wind energy for the past 16 months found that a wind farm could produce enough power for 150 000 homes more than the entire surrounding county has and create at least 200 jobs for the two year construction period and 40 to 50 permanent jobs to keep the turbines running underground mining according to the study would create at least another 200 direct mining jobs and potentially more if mountaintop removal were prevented given the current demand for coal from central appalachia the study acknowledges that while the four proposed mountain removal operation sites would generate far fewer jobs only an estimated 65 to 225 per year depending on how long the four permit areas were mined they would generate much more power however the study notes an important difference the mountain will yield only 14 years worth of coal from strip mining while a wind farm could operate indefinitely

5995453 i really doubt this is an action by the russian government i would think that russia with all its resources and experience in cyber warfare would do something more effective than put a website offline for a while or say the president is gay if it was state sponsored the site would be taken offline for good

5995456 the affiliate groups represent the core of cca and the current issues breakfast meeting is just one of many outlets cca has to make sure every members voice is heard
5995457 if we stop them now then we hope to stop them for good
5995458 what government should be focused on is raising the incomes and the aspirations and the opportunities for the millions of people who are stuck on low incomes and that is where this government has failed not because they are bad people not because they dont have noble ambitions but because their measure which is entirely reliant on the state which is about redistribution has failed failed on their own terms
5995459 our education system is failing to spread opportunity our welfare system is keeping people out of work our tax system makes it extremely difficult for those on low incomes to get off those low incomes because those marginal tax rates are so high
5995460 labour has failed it has created a more unfair society and i think there is a real opportunity for the conservative party now to lead this debate
5995461 while there was a small month on month increase in activity it represented a notable decline from a year ago
5995462 this continues the weaker picture seen in june and points towards the more subdued levels of lending we are likely to see in the second half of 2008

5995464 per jaar komt nu n op de twintig koopwoningen in nederland vrij voor de verkoop voor woningzoekenden is dus steeds minder aanbod beschikbaar ook al omdat het aanbod van nieuwbouwwoningen achterblijft bij de vraag
5995465 omdat er te weinig huizen beschikbaar zijn kost een volgende woning mensen vaak een paar ton meer dat is een gigantische investering
5995466 deze is toch 6 procent dat tikt aan op huizen met prijzen van 2 of 3 ton
5995467 de werkelijkheid is dat de pakistaanse regering op verschillende niveaus functioneert een van die niveaus houdt zich bezig met het beheer van de kernwapens
5995468 als pakistan kwetsbaarder wordt en zou vervallen tot de status van een mislukte staat worden zijn nucleaire verworvenheden een groot internationaal probleem de beste manier om dat te verhinderen is de bestuurscapaciteit van de nieuwe regering te vergroten

5995475 unlikely to require the divestiture of heathrow unless the sale of gatwick or stansted is likely to be impractical or ineffective
5995476 aspects of government policy restrict or distort competition by contributing to the current capacity constraints at baas london airports
5995477 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying the delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
5995478 separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
5995479 we have provisionally found that there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports
5995480 this is evident from a large number of factors including its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
5995481 this has resulted in investment that is not tailored to the requirements of airport users and lower levels and quality of service for both airlines and passengers
5995482 we have also provisionally found that there are competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
5995483 while we accept that constraints on runway capacity in the south east will limit the scope for the benefits of competition in the short term we believe that separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
5995484 over time we would expect these to increase significantly in scotland where there are no similar capacity constraints we believe separate owners of edinburgh and glasgow would similarly improve their offerings
5995485 baa has argued to us that there is no scope for competition to develop so long as there are capacity constraints we take the opposite view unless the market is opened up to competition there is a serious risk that the current capacity constraints will persist certainly for longer than in a better functioning market
5995486 the earliest new runway capacity will become available is 2015 at stansted with no additional runway capacity possible at heathrow before 2020
5995487 while we accept that government policy and the planning regime have contributed to the lack of capacity we have found that baa as the owner and operator of these london airports has played a major role in not pressing for more capacity sooner and in planning terminal and runway capacity on a conservative and sequential process such that its plans for one airport have been influenced by its plans elsewhere we accept however that baa has been more successful in undertaking several smaller projects simultaneously
5995488 in scotland baa has until recently been noticeably slow to develop new routes at glasgow and edinburgh while at aberdeen its investment plans are regarded as unambitious despite relatively high levels of profitability at southampton it has shown a reluctance to respond to its customers demands
5995489 by the differences in approach to both airline customers and development between baa and owners and operators of regional airports
5995490 we have identified significant competition between several pairs of such airports with benefits which include lower charges development of new routes and a far greater responsiveness to customers in terms of capacity development we note that both manchester and london city airports have expanded successfully without explicit government support
5995491 in regard to regulation we have found that the civil aviation authority caa is constrained by the current statutory framework and that consideration needs to be given to bring it closer into line with those of other sectoral regulators such as energy water and telecommunications with better defined duties objectives and powers including the protection of the interests of consumers the promotion of competition and the ability to impose economic licence conditions
5995492 there is also scope for the caa to play a more active role in facilitating agreement between baa and the airlines by ensuring an appropriate framework for consultation which is currently seriously lacking
5995493 the significant problems in the baa airports market will not be solved overnight and changes in ownership would only be a first step in freeing up the market and providing greater scope for more flexible development
5995494 changes to regulation may similarly be important and there could be benefits available from a less prescriptive government policy on airport capacity development though we recognise decisions on such policies which are wholly for government will be taken in a broader decision framework
5995495 the commissions findings should be assessed in the light of the urgent need for new airport capacity and a modern regulatory framework as well as the need which we recognise for improved service from the airport operator
5995496 the findings state that the lack of runway capacity is a main reason for what it calls the current poor standards of service and the lack of resilience at times of disruption which results in regular delays
5995497 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying the delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
5995498 we will be seeking urgent clarification from the government of how it believes this reports findings can be reconciled with the air transport policy it established in 2003 and its current review of economic regulation
5995499 we note however that this is not the end of the competition commission process and we will continue to point out to the commission the many areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies would be disproportionate and counter productive
5995500 just as the government is about to make the decisions that could lead to the first full length runways being built in the south east since the second world war the commission risks creating uncertainty delay and confusion at exactly the wrong time
5995501 in scotland the commission has apparently ignored the evidence presented by baa and supported by numerous respected third party organisations that clearly demonstrates that edinburgh and glasgow airports serve separate markets and therefore do not and would not compete regardless of ownership
5995502 the fall in oil prices if sustained would reduce some of the pressure on utility prices in the near term
5995503 pay growth had remained subdued some measures of inflation expectations had fallen back in july
5995504 recently debate has been confused by what we believe to be red herrings a recycled proposal for a hub airport in the thames estuary the suggestion an airport can function as a hub without the transfer traffic that makes it a hub the notion that vital rail investment is an alternative to rather than complementary to expansion
5995505 increasingly there are those who want to go over old arguments they want to start again from scratch even if that means another decade at least of policy stasis engaging in the debate is fine but we can no longer avoid facing up to long overdue decisions britains record of taking hard decisions and applying these to our national infrastructure has not been good especially compared with our european rivals which are building runways to meet demand and taking business from the uk in the process

5995539 the challenges we as a region face are multifaceted but we remain resolutely committed to fighting the double evils of laundering and financing of terrorism
5995540 further with increased globalisation our banking systems are increasingly under close scrutiny by our international trading partners particularly with regard to anti money laundering legal and regulatory frameworks
5995541 we are disturbed by these reports that a group of thugs in a government vehicle could systematically ransack the offices of critical newspapers
5995542 senegals reputation as a beacon of press freedom in west africa has dimmed in recent years the authorities must begin to reverse this decline by showing that those responsible for these attacks will be held to account
5995543 there is no difference between verbal written and physical violence press freedom does not at all give a journalist the right to continually attack honest citizens with impunity
5995544 violence is no ones perquisite and when one saws the wind one should expect to reap the whirlwind
5995545 theres always been a really big grass roots support on campus for sustainability programs alternative transportation programs
5995546 to make this a priority and give staff and students the resources they need to be able to make these choices but also to reduce dukes overall environmental footprint
5995547 all the students love the program its really high with our international students who are used to biking everywhere they go
5995548 its a lot like a library book checking out you come down here or you submit a request online you can do it from any computer or you can do it from here
5995549 i mean its a free bike for them so they live with it
5995550 most people live on central campus so it helps them to get from there to here because its really only a 10 minute stroll down the road
5995551 i dont see this as anything different than a shopping mall or an office building that has private security
5995552 its unacceptable when citizens feel they have to turn to private police who are not accountable to the public under the police services act not subject to standards of discipline and rules of professional conduct and over which there is no civilian oversight
5995553 when you have characters in front of your store disturbing your customers or your customers are afraid to come in i would have to go out and deal with them but we are trying to see if we can get professionals to do that because i am afraid to go out there
5995554 to listen to some in the arts community and the opposition you would think that theres blood in the streets

5995557 a conference club made a good offer and hes had an offer from a league team but im happy he is staying
5995558 it is people that often face prejudices in the community or find it hard to be accepted and they want to show that they are worthwhile
5995559 they want to take part and get their message across to hopefully create a better understanding of their particular situations
5995560 normally when you come in to choose something it can be quite a solitary experience so this gives a chance of some interaction we hope people will take it up
5995561 so often we can get stuck doing the same things talking to the same people and this is an opportunity to talk to someone whos had really different experiences to you and get another view of the world

5995621 there can be no business as usual with russia under the present circumstances
5995622 they blame us as if there were no requirements for the georgian side in the six points
5995623 i mean the requirements to bring back their troops to the places where they are on a permanent basis
5995624 are not and have never been after just small pieces of georgian territory
5995625 they want to demoralize my people and put them into panic
5995626 they want to not only get rid of the georgian government but get rid of all idea of georgias independence and freedom

5995637 there are many many first time drinkers in the first few months of college
5995638 what we have done is be very honest about this as an institution and trained staff to deal with it
5995639 now students start to experiment when they are no longer under their parents supervision
5995640 and that encourages them to drink in ways that are less safe for them

5995653 die menschheit hat jahrtausende lange positive erfahrung mit der hygienischen wirkung von kupfer
5995654 vor dem hintergrund der aktuellen probleme im gesundheitswesen hat das dki jetzt erste schritte unternommen um diese eigenschaften von kupfer in einem modernen krankenhaus anzuwenden
5995655 we have had meetings to get it into our heads that every game is a cup final with england we have to go out there and play well
5995656 there are no friendlies we have got to go out there and play well win the game and take that into the qualifiers
5995657 it was a shame that we couldnt be there watching the euros on tv i thought it would have been great to be there and having been to a world cup i know what to expect
5995658 weve not scored too many goals recently but weve had quite a few injuries so im not too concerned wayne has not played much and any side would miss him but im sure well be fine when he returns to the team
5995659 carlos was incredible on his own up front in pre season hes looked really sharp and hungry
5995660 theres a buzz around the place after the success of last seasons success but its going to be tough to retain the two trophies or even win more
5995661 the obvious disappointment of going out of europe to kaunas was difficult for everyone in the group to overcome
5995662 we felt we needed a boost and we got that initially with the win over falkirk and then the game with hearts which was an important one because it was the first home spl game of the season the addition of pedro mendes in that game was also a factor
5995663 i now feel we have moved on and we can get on with our season and i think overall we can say that we are over the kaunas result
5995664 weve agreed everything in terms of maurice edu and we now wait for the work permit and in the steve davis situation there are one or two small things to be tidied up
5995665 i felt that one of the improvements we had to make was overall possession of the ball and making better use of it barry ferguson took the brunt of that last season but you need the whole midfield to join in and help out
5995666 given that we have now increased the squad that will mean that some players are going to be unhappy because they are not getting a game
5995667 people expect to be checked when they enter the country and for the government to determine if theyre admissible or not
5995668 what they dont expect is for the government to keep a record for 15 years of their comings into the country
5995669 history has shown whether you are talking about criminal or terrorist activity that plotting planning or even relationships among conspirators can go on for years
5995670 basic travel records can quite literally help frontline officers to connect the dots
5995671 the empire for many people was the major sense of their existence now its no more
5995672 it was regarded as poor retarded you know just underdeveloped and so on
5995673 now under mr putin russia has finally emerged as a more or less well to do nation but it wanted to have the feeling that now it will be regarded by the other nations differently with more respect
5995674 washington has been neglecting the relationship with russia profoundly over the last eight years
5995675 weve had a situation time and time again when president bush has gone to a summit meeting you know declared his cooperation with his good friend president putin and then hes gone back to washington and nothing has happened
5995676 why for 15 years after the end of cold war west did do very little to make russia an ally and friend
5995677 every russian leader came to power saying reasonable things about the west and sooner or later something happens which will turn them anti american
5995678 i talk to my friends they basically say america is extremely selfish country and doesnt understand that other people may have different ideas different agendas different approaches
5995679 they do not trust that this effort undertaken by the u s in europe is against iran or against terrorist launches
5995680 they still think that this is against russia why what is the reason that instead of inviting both nations to cooperate closely they fight each other on that
5995681 all of them are in a stupor because they dont know what to say they dont want to speak out and support russia but on the other hand they dont want to come out and oppose russia
5995682 negotiations are under way as to how we can work with our partners
5995683 i knew she had it in her it was only a matter of time
5995684 with our team it always comes down to timely hits
5995685 we were often in scoring position but we forgot that we dont need to swing big because yukiko ueno provides the power
5995686 it makes us proud to be the owner of independent media the publisher of the moscow times the paper plays a significant role in helping to create an international and dynamic moscow professional media is an important element of social and economic progress thus giving us an opportunity to take part in the rapid and unique development of moscow
5995687 beginning to walk but by no means were they running
5995688 if that was a u s brigade it would not have gone into combat
5995689 from what ive heard a lot of the 4th brigade was hit pretty hard
5995690 some of the soldiers seemed really grateful for the things we taught them
5995691 come from the hills of georgia and some of them sign for their paycheck with an x
5995692 overall goal is to bring georgia up to nato standards
5995693 i know specifically that bravo company im sure and i hope from what i did for them that theyre better off than they would have been if this happened four weeks ago

5995699 now that means we just need to figure out a way to get them there
5995700 ive also asked for some additional forces on top of that for the current fight
5995701 but i would not use the term surge because i think we need a sustained presence

5995712 its annoying to see celebrities sponsoring the bears without understanding the consequences
5995713 we do not give a hoot about the views of parisians civil servants or the wife of the president
5995714 there should be no question in our country of choosing between bear and man
5995715 we must find a balanced means of coexistence on one hand the presence of bears in the pyrenees reflects a willingness to protect biodiversity on the other the support of the local population is essential

5995723 weve got mounds of evidence that an extremely powerful and unprecedented climate driven change is underway

5995727 you are in a maze of twisty passages all alike
5995728 although ahmed was deeply religious he was also 21 years old intelligent and had been interviewed by law enforcement twice before
5995729 there is nothing to suggest that ahmeds will was critically affected by the agents various appeals to his muslim beliefs and there is nothing inherently coercive about such tactics
5995730 we are very pleased with the courts thorough and well reasoned opinion rejecting defendant ahmeds motion to suppress the highly incriminating statements he made to the fbi
5995731 it makes no sense to conclude that a suspect has voluntarily given a statement to law enforcement officers when he has been promised he will not be arrested and left alone if he talks but will be arrested and prosecuted if he does not
5995732 bargain hungers have returned to the market on talks that a rescue package is on the way
5995733 incremental risk to global growth from weakening growth data from europe will continue to put a floor on the dollar
5995734 the significant cost is oil and we have seen a significant decrease in prices of oil so from that point of view if input costs moderate as we expect them to there will be no pressure on us to increase prices
5995735 we are looking at external funding to the extent of 26 billion rupees
5995736 we will hold a controlling stake in each project that is for sure

5995738 the price in the federal reserve is about 2 plus percent in the capital markets its four times as high

5995747 weve definitely found some good things in this area as well helping our agility and stability in the corners and we are faster with these new tyres its been a good test and now we are looking forward to the final six battles

5995770 el 80 por ciento de los locales que hay en el barrio son privados entiendo que sea complicado localizar a los propietarios o sus herederos pero el ayuntamiento tiene que tomar cartas en el asunto
5995771 lo que estoy pidiendo es m s jardines y parques adem s de equipamientos as como una reuni n entre los vecinos la junta de andaluc a y el ayuntamiento para hablar de un plan para el barrio

5995780 on behalf of my brother i would like to thank everyone who sent their sympathy to archbishop michel coppenrath
5995781 an evangelist a visionary and a man attentive to the people
5995782 michel coppenrath in the great evangelic tradition of your predecessors you gave your life to the service of faith the catholic church and its faithful with full respect of man and other beliefs
5995783 a servant of god but a lucid and vigilant citizen within our society you helped to train our youth and build our country with your always enlightened and wise advice
5995784 to see you leave this world to which you have given so much
5995785 remain deep in our hearts and our memories as a great servant of god who has devoted his life to help his neighbor
5995786 one last time on behalf of everyone i bow to your memory michel coppenrath we will never forget you

5995788 one of my big fears is the australian government had special work visas where they issued to workers coming from asia and they found that is some cases those people were being exploited by employers he said
5995789 the australian government im told has learnt through that experience and they dont want it repeated with our people going to australia for rural work
5995790 first we would like to see that our workers belong to a trade union in australia because they would receive some protection from exploitation if they became trade unionists
5995791 asian central banks are intent and content with smoothing the depreciation of their currencies
5995792 they know that massive intervention has no effect amid a globally strong dollar and the won cannot rise on intervention
5995793 the bank of korea looks like it is slowing retreating and pulling back its defense of 1 050 may be back the next psychological figure of 1 100

5995796 if ofws persist in sending more money it will not be physically sustainable for them
5995797 we cant handle the pressure and feel like we must cave to their demands
5995798 but mike there are hundreds of appraisers who set aside all that and went for the quick buck
5995799 we will oppose that renegotiation the case is not mooted by the manifestation
5995800 we want a supreme court ruling which would permanently stop the signing of the moa
5995801 yes as long as the new provisions would embody that condition of being answerable to the constitution

5995806 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
5995807 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5995808 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
5995809 there can be no business as usual with russia under the present circumstances
5995810 they blame us as if there were no requirements for the georgian side in the six points
5995811 i mean the requirements to bring back their troops to the places where they are on a permanent basis
5995812 are not and have never been after just small pieces of georgian territory
5995813 they want to demoralize my people and put them into panic
5995814 they want to not only get rid of the georgian government but get rid of all idea of georgias independence and freedom
5995815 every day that goes by after the deadline is a day that the world can see that russia is not living up to its word
5995816 with every commitment and every failure to live up to the commitment international pressure will grow
5995817 military action must cease definitively and military forces must return to their positions held prior to the outbreak of hostilities
5995818 as long as russian forces are basically occupying a large part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convene at whatever level
5995819 i should add that we certainly do not have the intention to close all doors in our communication with russia but the future will depend on the concrete actions from the russian side
5995820 full and immediate compliance with the cease fire agreement to which the parties have subscribed
5995821 they can put it to a vote if they want to

5995823 if you are in the settlement industry id suggest you sharpen up on the mass tort and non qualified structure area as we are going to see a massive wave of litigation tied to the billions of dollars in losses from these types of criminal lending practices

5995834 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks like it could be a boomerang storm
5995835 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
5995836 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
5995837 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously
5995838 i just came in from the fields everything is burning up
5995839 if a storm is brewing down there just send it up i 26
5995840 for laying each section of the reef we need it perfectly flat
5995841 if we get a break in the weather i dont see a problem at all
5995842 the reef doesnt make waves if there is no swell it isnt going to do anything it really breaks them where and how we want them
5995843 it will basically focus the waves energy amplify it and ensure no loss of power
5995844 you should get a more powerful consistent wave and it will definitely improve the surfing we have got
5995845 the real hard core surfers will always go where the best waves are
5995846 but they are not the main market it is the short mid week break where we will do well we will offer that as an alternative to cornwall
5995847 we still have a very strong traditional guest house market as well i think the surfing market does have a wide appeal and there is little conflict between the two
5995848 people are more interested in doing something good with their leisure time rather than lying around on the beach drinking beer
5995849 i think there has been a cultural shift in the past 10 years
5995850 how will the extra people be catered for in terms of transport and getting them to the seafront
5995851 there have been concerns about that and that remains the case
5995852 it is pretty well documented that groynes dont work as well as it is perceived
5995853 they have to replaced every so often and they are not that nice either

5995858 working with the ambulance service we removed the roof of the cab and the doors
5995859 the last operation was to cut the pole with hydraulic cutting equipment not close to his chest and back but just leaving a little bit sticking out
5995860 he was trapped in his cab through the chest and through the back of the cab these were very serious injuries he was stabilised at the scene by ourselves and the pole was cut

5995864 what they are going to be doing is looking over the findings with police talking to them about what they have found and a decision will be made from there
5995865 at the moment we are still unable to say where the investigation is up to they have collected evidence and they are going to look at it
5995866 structural engineers will be working closely with the fire brigade this week to examine the extent of the damage to the roof of the store it could be months before the store is open for trade again

5995870 i couldnt believe it when i saw how much i needed to pay i then realised that it was archie
5995871 i had to email the guy who was selling it asking him to call me urgently
5995872 thankfully he called and when i told him what had happened he was very understanding although before he put the phone down he did ask if i still wanted it
5995873 we have seen the funny side but i have told archie that he cant do things like that again it does show how clever he is
5995874 he said he only wanted the games the problem is he doesnt understand money
5995875 he thinks they cost very little or are free he thinks the figure he typed in was only pennies
5995876 it doesnt really surprise me what he has done he has always loved computers he shows me how to do things
5995877 it is not often we see this kind of thing this case is very unusual and he is obviously a very clever boy
5995878 this has been a high performing prison and the drift the inspector identifies in terms of safety is particularly worrying
5995879 often the problems around working with muslim prisoners come out of misunderstanding and ignorance
5995880 the prison service has done a lot to address the issues around race what this report flags up is it needs to be re enforced
5995881 high security prisons are having to adapt to a sudden increase in terrorist suspect prisoners its a challenge not just for frankland but for high security prisons generally
5995882 there needs to be more training in diversity issues staff feel that they cant challenge prisoners about their behaviour without being seen as being racist
5995883 franklands population had become even more challenging recently with increases in gang affiliations and the arrival of a small number of convicted terrorists
5995884 this is particularly important as the prison expands to over 1 000 prisoners far more than any dispersal prison has so far been required to hold
5995885 i am concerned about the comments raised on the safety within frankland however this should be seen in the context of franklands extremely challenging population
5995886 the issues raised in the report are currently being addressed by the governor and staff at frankland
5995887 the prison is fully committed towards equality for all prisoners irrespective of their ethnic background or religious beliefs
5995888 once again were seeing evidence of a jail struggling with growing prisoner numbers drugs misuse and racial problems while having little focus on resettling offenders at the end of their sentence frankland might house particularly serious criminals but the problems it faces can be seen right across britains overcrowded jails
5995889 my name is seungri you gave people quite the scare there
5995890 hello seungri my name is sunmi sorry about that i missed being back at home so much i guess my happiness got the best of me
5995891 well thank you for helping me when you start dancing down the street and dont notice ongoing traffic ill be sure to return the favor

5996046 i have begun a task to rebuild afghanistan into a peaceful prosperous country into a democratic country a country where the afghan people will have a voice and their rights respected a country that will be producing on its own and living off its own means
5996047 i have achieved some of those objectives i have not achieved some of the other objectives
5996048 afghanistan is not at peace the afghan people still suffer massively in the war against terrorism and in the war for stability in afghanistan afghanistan is not yet a well off country still a very poor country he said

5996070 weve definitely been excited about the growth and embrace of technology by both voters and candidates
5996071 its been explosive its light years from 2004 youtube didnt exist four years ago and now it is being heavily used for politics
5996072 google is attempting to expand its influence over the political process to help it achieve its commercial goals
5996073 google likes to bask in self congratulatory rhetoric claiming it has the publics interests at heart its all about accessing peoples data for targeted marketing
5996074 in this us election year what information could be more important than the candidates own words to describe their views actions and platforms
5996075 as idealistic as that sounds is as idealistic as we are it is exciting all around not just for google

5996088 theres ample evidence that he khawaja wanted to be a front line jihadi soldier in afghanistan
5996089 is it okay to be making bombs in your basement its not okay it may well be criminal but its not terrorism as contained in the criminal code
5996090 nowhere in all the evidence does it point to any participation of momin in bombing a nightclub a shopping centre british telecom or a railway
5996091 what comes across is a definite distinction of what is discussed when momin is there and when hes not there
5996092 election day is a long day anything we can do to make it better for the poll workers is worth the effort a warm cup of coffee and a donut might also be appreciated

5996102 i was actually standing next to rio at the time the first thing rio did was turn to me and shake my hand and thats a measure of the kind of guy he is stevie g becks lampsy did the same and they are all great players
5996103 being captain of these kind of players makes it extra special for me
5996104 i think that showed what kind of character i am to the manager to come back and bounce back like i did after that huge disappointment

5996127 is it real is it real did i really win gold
5996128 i wanted to make china proud in the olympics that china is hosting
5996129 in the first leg i felt the gold was already in my pocket because i was first and the chinese girl was behind in the end i turned around on the last leg and realized that maybe spain had given up
5996130 our position is that we cant recommend the players tour pakistan for the champions trophy obviously we put a position forward a few weeks ago to the icc to that effect but we said we would keep an open mind with the taskforce which we did we heard them speak on friday now we have had a chance to digest it our position hasnt changed
5996131 our biggest challenge in designing the new g convertible was keeping the beauty of the g37 coupe on which it is based
5996132 themed around unity a theme that paris hiltons famous video brought to public awareness
5996133 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5996134 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5996135 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5996136 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5996137 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5996138 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5996139 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5996140 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5996141 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5996142 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5996143 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5996144 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5996145 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5996146 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
5996147 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
5996148 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5996149 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5996150 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5996151 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5996152 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5996153 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5996154 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5996155 yang efektif ya salah satunya dengan menerapkan windfall profit tax lewat uu pajak penghasilan
5996156 istilah sharing the pain itu sendiri kan sebenarnya tidak ada kalau untuk setingkat negara yang berdaulat mestinya ya bukan meminta seperti itu tapi menerapkan memang ini butuh ketegasan pemerintah dan kejelasan konsepnya yang lebih fair ini mestinya didasarkan atas pertumbuhan keuntungan kkks bukan cuma didasarkan atas harga minyak saja
5996157 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5996158 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5996159 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5996160 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5996161 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5996162 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5996163 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5996164 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5996165 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5996166 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5996167 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5996168 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5996169 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5996170 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5996171 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5996172 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5996173 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5996174 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5996175 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5996176 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5996177 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5996178 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5996179 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5996180 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5996181 tambahan pendapatan yang diterima pemerintah seharusnya bukan untuk menambal subsidi bbm kalau ngasih subsidi lagi orang malah jadi boros
5996182 jadi windfall profit tax itu harusnya bukan untuk jangka pendek karena kontra produktif dengan peningkatan produksi windfall profit tax itu kan disinsentif bagi mereka
5996183 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5996184 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5996185 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
5996186 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
5996187 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
5996188 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
5996189 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5996190 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5996191 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5996192 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5996193 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5996194 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5996195 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5996196 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5996197 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5996198 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5996199 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5996200 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5996201 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5996202 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5996203 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5996204 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5996205 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5996206 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5996207 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5996208 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5996209 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5996210 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5996211 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5996212 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5996213 dessert express 100 sweet treats you can make in 30 minutes or less

5996266 for the republicans its going to get worse before it gets better
5996267 i think they will take a pretty severe beating in this election
5996268 and the first six months of 2007 may turn out in retrospect to be the bottoming out point of the republican party as an institution the 2006 elections were a tremendous wake up call
5996269 a broadly center right party that achieves the goals of the american people

5996279 its a flattering color on every woman its not a color i think youre going to want for an evening situation but it will look great in the daytime
5996280 youre going to see a lot of melding of all these colors especially a glen plaid or a check they work like the solid thats not a solid a good investment piece isnt always black pants or a white dress

5996315 social media has a strong appeal for your 20 somethings as a starting point because there is opportunity there
5996316 its a relatively new field but it has been taking off and a lot of local companies are paying attention to it for the first time companies want the best and the brightest and as a result people are being poached there is a talent shortage and it is the case that companies have not found enough time to build up their own resources
5996317 where companies can really score in the social media space is if they use it as a platform to talk to people who they want to hire
5996318 we live in a materialistic age and people are facing a crunch
5996319 its going to change how we interact with social media start ups have a highly personalised touch and you feel that communication and you feel it is coming from the heart for eg their blog posts as a lot of companies jump on board however you get bogged down into formalised structures many stars jumping across are going to feel stifled

5996347 but i was wondering why those who kill over 200 people are afraid of facing the death penalty themselves
5996348 i think if we have a review of the status of the death penalty we have to review the overall system of punishment because we dont want to see for example someone who is involved in a serious murder be freed before the age of 50 or below 50 and continue to be a problem for the society
5996349 the possibility of the death penalty being abolished has to be balanced with a more adequate system of punishment
5996350 im open for having this we are all quite open to discuss it
5996351 costco has a reputation of selling in bulk at very low prices and given the economy today and the publics desire to buy things in bulk and buy them cheaper it seems to me we should welcome any store that wants to come here
5996352 2012 will be a massive test of the quality of our public space not just in london but right across the country when people gather in all the major civic spaces to watch and celebrate so are we ready local authorities have four years to get it right
5996353 rather than support the expansion of airports the government should invest in greener travel alternatives such as high speed rail links and make it cheaper for people to travel this way
5996354 if andrei could have tempered his financial appetite it was quite possible he would be playing at the emirates right now
5996355 arsene wenger is indeed a cunning fox who always says one thing and does the other he wanted andrei but arsenal are the only top english club who do not pay large salaries
5996356 limitations in the supply of blood can have potentially life threatening consequences for patients with massive blood loss
5996357 embryonic stem cells represent a new source of cells that can be propagated and expanded indefinitely providing a potentially inexhaustible source of red blood cells for human therapy
5996358 we can currently generate 10 to 100 billion red blood cells from a single six well plate of stem cells
5996359 although a ngn rollout for cost savings and service agility is the step in the right direction for all incumbent and integrated telcos there are still multiple issues that telcos face like the business case for new services the right architecture from a rollout perspective and the transition time for migration into a full fledged ngn infrastructure
5996360 thus there is no size fits all when it comes to transformation initiatives and each operator has to define his vision of his next generation and accordingly shape his business and network strategy
5996361 a big nessies head is being built out there for the float which might have a wee castle on it and a golf club and maybe whisky bottles
5996362 the parade is watched by 500 000 people on the streets and is televised i think it is watched by 10 million people in china japan and korea
5996363 weve managed to get one piper so far but there is a club for ex pat scots in china and from that we are hoping more pipers will be able to attend
5996364 i am not worried you have to give them time
5996365 theo is not yet completely there collectively but he can make decisions in big games
5996366 actually we had those on the blotter and four or five more the next night
5996367 we do have some prostitutes who work in the area of mercer street and thorn street and were doing everything we can to get rid of the problem we do get complaints from business owners and people shopping in the area
5996368 its not as easy as people think to arrest and convict for prostitution its hard to get someone to go up and work for you theres a lot involved
5996369 breaking up the baa monopoly is a long overdue move to make aviation fairer to passengers
5996370 the next step is to end the hidden public subsidy to the aviation industry to make air travel fair to the environment as well
5996371 lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
5996372 while we accept that constraints on runway capacity in the south east will limit the scope for the benefits of competition in the short term we believe that separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
5996373 just as the government is about to make the decisions that could lead to the first full length runways being built in the south east since the second world war the commission risks creating uncertainty delay and confusion at exactly the wrong time
5996374 in scotland the commission has apparently ignored the evidence presented by baa and supported by numerous respected third party organisations that clearly demonstrates that serve separate markets and therefore do not and would not compete regardless of ownership
5996375 the vehicle failed shortly after liftoff and in no way reached its intended position
5996376 the failed launch shows that the purported iranian space program is in its nascent stages at best they have a long way to go

5996379 russian troops will have to withdraw now to their pre crisis positions
5996380 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
5996381 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5996382 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5996383 the uk has a rigorous system in place for managing child sex offenders which is among the toughest in the world the changes im announcing today will strengthen that even further
5996384 i want to see anyone who poses a threat to our children dealt with as firmly as possible ive spoken to child protection experts and the police and they have told me that these changes will further restrict the ability of child sex offenders to harm children both here and overseas
5996385 i will legislate for these measures as soon as possible
5996386 we have been consistently saying that when there is clear evidence a sex offender poses a risk the authorities must have effective powers to stop them from going abroad
5996387 but if they do travel there must be better systems in place to monitor and track their movements the uk government has a crucial role to play in working more closely with other governments and police to keeps sex offenders on the radar and bring those who commit sexual crimes against children to justice
5996388 simply redistributing money simply chucking money at people simply relying on tax credits has failed
5996389 there is absolutely no conservative plan to in any way get rid of tax credits indeed if anything we want to strengthen tax credits
5996390 cameronomics is emerging in which photo ops warm words and conflicting promises attempt to distract from a risky and destructive ideological agenda
5996391 cameron knows that his party are keen for some traditional tory red meat especially on tax cuts their policy positions also reveal ideological stances which would be bad for the british economy

5996405 the only thing thats a surprise is how quickly it has happened after musharraf left theyve hardly had time to savour their victory
5996406 the coalition may not continue if the judges are not restored
5996407 if elections are held i dont think the peoples party can survive it will be wiped out
5996408 if they dont settle it then we could review our strategy and relations with the government all options will be open
5996409 the army wants to be neutral now they want to be out of politics and i dont see them playing a role in the near future
5996410 theyre not coming back tomorrow but if the situation gets worse and you begin to hear a public clamour for something to be done because the coalition government is in paralysis and the country is spiralling downwards then all bets are off
5996411 la conviction du gouvernement tout entier est que la politique conomique que nous avons engag e est la seule politique conomique adapt e la situation que nous connaissons
5996412 nous avons besoin de r formes de structures nous navons pas besoin dun plan de relance qui serait un plan de relance artificiel

5996415 dune part cest parce que la croissance est faible quil faut baisser les imp ts dautre part pour r duire les d ficits il ne faut pas augmenter les imp ts mais diminuer les d penses publiques
5996416 cest leurope naturellement qui est tout enti re confront e au ralentissement conomique

5996423 im accepting the responsibility of what happened here in lanao pero wag niyong idamay yung aking kasundaluhan na kami nag pro protect but dont accuse my soldiers of being remiss with their duties to protect the community
5996424 now whether or not they surrender these people we are in the process of apprehending them and we will not stop whether or not they do that law enforcement operations against these people will not stop
5996425 the best thing to do for them is to surrender these people so we can prosecute them
5996426 the attacks could qualify as terrorist act however as we stated earlier the use of the human security act is a different legal proceeding and a separate legal proceeding in itself
5996427 right now we are busy collating evidence for common criminal crimes and we dont want to divert attention by special procedures under the human security act in order to make a case out of terrorism maybe after perhaps
5996428 women have to find a way to be assimilated into the working group without compromising their principles

5996445 this team now i think its difficult to comprehend how much better they are

5996468 the tone of the august discussion confirms that the interest rate debate remains finely balanced for now
5996469 accordingly there is little here to suggest that other members are about to join blanchflower in voting for a cut in the very near future economy heading towards recession we still think rates could be falling by year end and will eventually drop much further than the markets expect
5996470 most members of the committee judged that the current stance of monetary policy was broadly appropriate and that bank rate should be maintained at five percent this month
5996471 inflation was likely to move further above the governments 2 0 percent target in the coming months the outlook for activity growth had continued to worsen but some build up in the margin of spare capacity was likely to be necessary to ensure that inflation returned to the target in the medium term

5996488 im not going to lecture school leaders about the decisions they make in their individual school but from the point of view of the national government what we want to see is rising standards we want to see educational excellence

5996495 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5996496 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5996497 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5996498 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5996499 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5996500 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5996501 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5996502 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5996503 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5996504 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5996505 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5996506 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5996507 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community

5996509 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5996510 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5996511 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5996512 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5996513 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5996514 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5996515 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5996516 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5996517 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5996518 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5996519 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5996520 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5996521 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5996522 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5996523 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5996524 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5996525 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5996526 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5996527 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5996528 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5996529 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5996530 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5996531 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5996532 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5996533 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5996534 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5996535 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5996536 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5996537 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5996538 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5996539 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5996540 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5996541 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5996542 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5996543 we ste da buon informatico non puoi che leggere questa lettera
5996544 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection

5996550 were always looking at new phone platforms to expand into for garmin mobile but we dont have any announcements regarding the iphone at this time
5996551 not have immediate plans for this but we are looking into it
5996552 in talking to some of the guys in the software community they believe well see voice turn by turn directions within the next three months
5996553 just like every other developer we signed up for the program and downloaded the sdk even though there were some specific clauses in the developer agreement that said you cant write gps navigation applications
5996554 which is more than capable of providing an application like this
5996555 were very excited to be working with apple to bring the iphone 3g to turkey
5996556 iphone 3g represents the ultimate in mobile device technologies and we cant wait to offer this innovative product to millions of mobile customers later this year
5996557 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
5996558 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
5996559 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
5996560 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
5996561 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
5996562 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
5996563 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
5996564 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
5996565 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
5996566 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
5996567 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
5996568 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
5996569 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
5996570 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
5996571 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
5996572 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
5996573 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
5996574 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
5996575 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
5996576 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5996577 this is a planning took where all things are going
5996578 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5996579 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5996580 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5996581 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5996582 the cost of capital of this nature is just staggering
5996583 they will want as much assurance as they can possibly get
5996584 foreigners who visit japan think they have a solid grasp of japanese food before they even set foot in the country sushi teriyaki maybe some noodles
5996585 just mention my name said mabel but she said it once too often
5996586 there is my friend gladys she is a wizard with people who have no card sense just mention my name when your game improves youll have no problem getting players
5996587 you must go to my psychologist mention my name for an appointment
5996588 you must go to my hairdressing salon ask for anton and mention my name he is creative with baby fluff like yours
5996589 your constant mantra of just mention my name is brain washing i act on it and it is an abandonment of self i know that friendship demands tolerance of each others imperfections but im inauthentic with you please please mabel stop
5996590 interesting formulation you should be in a creative writing group here is their number the mention of my name will assure your acceptance
5996591 help improve the well being of people around the world through
5996592 to succeed you need four things smart people smart ideas an investment in innovation and the right environment to bring this together
5996593 it starts with teachers its not about throwing money at the problem its about throwing good qualified people at it and giving them the resources to solve the problem
5996594 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5996595 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5996596 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5996597 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5996598 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5996599 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5996600 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5996601 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5996602 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5996603 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5996604 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5996605 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
5996606 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
5996607 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
5996608 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
5996609 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
5996610 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
5996611 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
5996612 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
5996613 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
5996614 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
5996615 a plea for a new way of imagining the future of palestine israel not two separate ethnic states but a modern multi ethnic multi religious country able to sustain both palestinians and jews
5996616 sadly despite the strong staging and the intentions set out by the playwrights the play was unbalanced and came across as deeply pro palestinian for this kind of play to work it just has to come across as even handed what sticks out above all is the insulting portrayal of the male israeli security guards who come across as heartless paranoid thugs
5996617 this month is meant to recognize the impact gay lesbian and
5996618 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5996619 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5996620 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5996621 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5996622 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5996623 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5996624 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5996625 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5996626 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5996627 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5996628 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5996629 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5996630 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5996631 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5996632 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5996633 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5996634 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5996635 we want to make it clear that we are in the solid state business
5996636 this is just the first iteration of our roadmap we will be developing a range of products for a variety of market segments
5996637 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
5996638 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
5996639 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5996640 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5996641 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5996642 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5996643 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5996644 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5996645 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5996646 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5996647 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5996648 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5996649 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5996650 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5996651 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5996652 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5996653 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5996654 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5996655 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5996656 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5996657 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5996658 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5996659 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
5996660 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
5996661 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
5996662 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
5996663 iphone and nokia owners who regularly call north america can purchase truphones bundle to get peace of mind pricing of just 1 5 us cents 0 75 pence per minute to the usa and canada from anywhere in the world people dont want to calculate precise per minute rates or check tariff websites or take a paid for tariff bolt on to get a still high rate they simply want to feel comfortable about what theyre going to pay for the call they want to make
5996664 siamo contenti di accoglierepc tools nella famiglia symantec orientata al mercato consumer ha commentato la group president janice chaffin e crediamo che linsieme delle due aziende possa offrire al consumatore maggior valore e la possibilit di proteggere meglio la propria vita digitale

5996666 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5996667 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5996668 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5996669 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5996670 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5996671 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5996672 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5996673 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5996674 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5996675 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5996676 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5996677 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5996678 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5996679 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5996680 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5996681 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5996682 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5996683 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5996684 it will be ready to fly into low earth orbit within a year
5996685 all we need now is some extra funding but 1 5m would get it airborne
5996686 das team von amberfin hat seit der firmengr ndung im april bereits eine positive dynamik im film und rundfunkmarkt geschaffen durch die neugewinnung von mehrere renommierte kunden ich freue mich auf diesen grundlagen aufzubauen um die operative effizienz weiter auszubauen und eine strategie f r langfristiges zuk nftiges wachstum umzusetzen diese schritte werden es uns erm glichen unser kundenportfolio besser zu bedienen und amberfin zum f hrenden anbieter f r dateibasierte digitale arbeitsabl ufe und die verwaltung von medieninhalten zu entwickeln die innovative icr technologie von amberfin hat sich in der branche bereits bew hrt und ich m chte teil eines unternehmens sein das allen eigent mern von medieninhalten content owners dabei hilft ihre gesch ftsmodelle umzustellen und den wert ihrer investitionen in medieninhalte zu steigern ob es sich nun um die bereiche film rundfunk internet mobilfunk oder telekommunikation handelt
5996687 jeremy deaner ist genau zum richtigen zeitpunkt beigetreten um einem noch jungen unternehmen eine frische perspektive zu bieten in kombination mit seiner erfahrung bei der leitung marktf hrender unternehmen wird jeremy deaner f r amberfin von unsch tzbarem wert sein um unsere globale pr senz weiter ausbauen und unseren gesch ftsbetrieb im dynamischen medienmarkt zu verst rken durch seine ernennung wird unser globales team um ein sehr erfahrenes mitglied bereichert dies wird uns dabei helfen unsere position als branchenf hrer auszubauen
5996688 spannung vor der pr sentation das brandneue video zum erfolgssong
5996689 sch n und gut dass die gro en b rsenotierten unternehmen sich f r ihre steuerleistung loben lassen aber die realit t schaut leider anders aus
5996690 gemessen an den gewinnsteigerungen sind die steuerleistungen mehr als d rftig
5996691 bei der verm gensbelastung gehen wir gegen null die unternehmensbesteuerung wird immer weiter zur ck geschraubt auf der anderen seite ist die belastung auf arbeit in sterreich insgesamt zu hoch wir brauchen rasch eine steuerreform die f r mehr gerechtigkeit und fairness sorgt
5996692 wir sind froh nun endlich ein modul anbieten zu k nnen das diese verkaufsl cke schlie t ber 55 der deutschen f hrerscheine sind bereits im scheckkarten format ausgeliefert tendenz stark steigend in einer aufr stung steckt also jedenfalls potenzial
5996693 im krassen gegensatz zum informationspolitischen versagen bei den besorgniserregenden messergebnissen den donaukanal betreffend lobt sich die sp stadtregierung schon jahrelang ob ihrer eigenen sanierungserfolge bei den wiener flie gew ssern
5996694 der wiener stadtregierung scheint es in der umweltpolitik am allerwenigsten um transparenz zu gehen sondern ums besch nigen
5996695 doch ein wichtiger teil der umweltpolitik ist nun einmal die rechtzeitige offene und transparente information der bev lkerung
5996696 insgesamt vier mal seit 2006 h tte es hier einen offiziellen umweltalarm geben m ssen tats chlich erfuhren die wienerinnen und wiener von den vorf llen erst aus der zeitung
5996697 nicht nur an hand des donaukanals sondern auch aufgrund der vorgangsweise beim liesingbach l sst sich eindeutig eine unzureichende informationspolitik der sp umweltstadtr tin in sachen umweltalarm bei wiens flie gew ssern attestieren
5996698 die wiener bev lkerung hat ein recht auf sauberes wasser und auf schnelle und ausreichende information sollte dies einmal nicht der fall sein
5996699 mit zunehmender reichweite und der attraktivit t unseres programms gewinnt austria 9 tv t glich an akzeptanz bei den zusehern mit den 1 5 mio haushalten die heute das austria 9 tv programm empfangen liegen wir zeitlich weit vor unserem gesteckten ziel
5996700 damit alle jugendlichen die chance auf eine gute ausbildung mit zukunft haben muss das von den sozialpartnern mit der regierung vereinbarte jugendbesch ftigungspaket sofort umgesetzt werden
5996701 jetzt kommt es darauf an dass die zusagen halten und die vereinbarten pl tze so rasch wie m glich geschaffen werden damit die jungen eine chance auf einen guten ausbildungsplatz haben brauchen wir jeden einzelnen der zugesagten pl tze
5996702 wir d rfen jetzt nicht z gern und die zeit der jungen menschen vergeuden die n chste regierung muss rasch handeln und das bereits vereinbarte jugendbesch ftigungspaket umsetzen
5996703 n tig ist auch dass wir f r mehr lehrstellen mit qualit t sorgen die den lehrlingen nach dem lehrabschluss gute chancen im beruf bringen
5996704 mehr und bessere lehrstellen das ist das wichtigste f r unsere jungen
5996705 our house was one of the first to be affected the water got into an old dairy building which is used as a study and we were terrified it would reach the house
5996706 we noticed that mud was coming down the mountain and there was what looked like a landslide at the back of the house
5996707 its great to have such a strong community spirit they did everything possible to clear the road and keep the water from the house im studying at the moment and use the dairy as a study we managed to get the books out but my printer is gone thankfully the flood didnt get to the house but there was a bit of damage done trying to move things out and prepare for the worst
5996708 we are fairly new in the locality but even the oldest of the neighbours doesnt remember anything like this in the past the next day the sun was shining and youd think nothing had ever happened
5996709 sligo county council has been on call for a number of nights doing everything to keep roads passable parts of the road to ballina had to be drained and would have been blocked by debris if crews hadnt stepped in so quickly
5996710 the work will be done under the clar programme and it could begin in the next few weeks we just need to get the final approvals
5996711 fire crews were out at tullinaglug where the water was just inches from the back door of a home where a stream burst its banks the flooding has now receded in many areas but if the rain continues into next week we dont know what will happen
5996712 the pitch was only recently sanded but the intensity of the rain washed the new surface off were trying to get something there as quickly as possible
5996713 a number of pubs and clothes shops on wolfe tone square were hit a few weeks back and work was done fortunately there was no serious impact there this time around
5996714 ich habe selbst von den enormen chancen und m glichkeiten profitiert die das vereinte europa seinen b rgern bietet es ist unverantwortlich wenn die sp das projekt europa f r billigen populismus aufs spiel setzt
5996715 das liberale forum steht f r mutige und faire l sungen mit weitblick
5996716 ich habe selbst in irland ein unternehmen gegr ndet und gesehen wie einfach dort der schritt in die unabh ngigkeit ist
5996717 die politik ist dringend gefordert endlich auf den wandel in der wirtschaft und am arbeitsmarkt zu reagieren und moderne gerechte rahmenbedingungen zu schaffen
5996718 christina szalay verk rpert selbst den europ ischen geist sie hat in irland deutschland und australien gelebt und gearbeitet und will aktiv die chancen f rdern die europa jeder und jedem einzelnen bietet gleichzeitig ist es ihr ein anliegen den menschen europa mit fairen und klaren entscheidungsprozessen begreifbar zu machen
5996719 die vereinbarte kooperation mit time matters bedeutet riesige chancen f r die siemens sektoren ein hohes serviceniveau bei g nstigeren frachtraten zu erzielen
5996720 dass im zuge dieser entwicklung die herausforderungen an die ersatzteillogistik erheblich gewachsen sind und weiter zunehmen werden liegt auf der hand
5996721 bei uns spielt qualit t des after sales service eine ganz entscheidende rolle vor allem weil bei vielen unserer produkte eine verz gerte ersatzteillieferung zu ausfallkosten in enormer h he und zur unzufriedenheit unserer kunden f hrt
5996722 zentrale lager in den jeweiligen zeitzonen bilden die basis unserer globalen ersatzteilversorgung mit der beauftragung von time matters verfolgen wir im wesentlichen ein ziel unseren kunden auch k nftig in der ersatzteilversorgung eine kompromisslose und hochflexible servicequalit t zu bieten in gestalt ebenso schneller wie zuverl ssiger lieferungen
5996723 spenden co finanzierte organisationen wie der samariterbund erbringen mit hilfe von spendenmitteln wichtige aufgaben f r die gesellschaft wie viele andere non profit organisationen muss auch der samariterbund in zeiten wo alles teurer wird verst rktes augenmerk darauf legen wie zus tzliche spenden lukriert werden k nnen um das leistungsniveau im gewohnten ausma und in der gewohnten qualit t zu halten obwohl seit geraumer zeit modelle und entw rfe auf dem tisch liegen scheint die politik bis auf gute absichten wenig konkretes interesse an diesem thema zu haben was auch daran erkennbar ist dass sich keiner der zahlreich in alpbach anwesenden vertreter der politik zeit f r eine diskussion zu diesem thema genommen hat
5996724 ich bin davon berzeugt dass es im interesse unseres landes und unserer gesellschaft ist dass man sich in der politik m glichst rasch gedanken macht wie das spenden f r spender attraktiver gemacht werden kann
5996725 denn dadurch setzt man auch ein deutliches signal welche werte und grunds tze in einem land begr t anerkannt und gef rdert werden
5996726 with everything on your plate is that ever going to be possible
5996727 what is the opposite of what i would normally do
5996728 what would i do if i knew i was going to die tomorrow
5996729 if i was already a millionaire billionaire what would i do to solve this problem
5996730 what would have to happen to get you to slow down enough to work on that marketing plan
5996731 you know im feeling so drained i just dont have the bandwidth to think that far out its just easier to run around patching these holes than slow down and deal with the bigger situations
5996732 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5996733 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5996734 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5996735 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5996736 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5996737 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5996738 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5996739 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5996740 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5996741 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5996742 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5996743 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5996744 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5996745 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5996746 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5996747 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5996748 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5996749 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5996750 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5996751 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5996752 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5996753 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5996754 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5996755 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5996756 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5996757 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5996758 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

5996764 im bericht dieses komitees wird nicht nur unser land als hort des rassismus verunglimpft sondern es werden geradezu l cherliche klischees bedient die politisch korrekten gutmenschen sollten sich nicht ber angebliche bergriffe der polizei auf schwarzafrikaner besorgt zeigen sondern ber den drogenhandel der fest in den h nden des schwarzafrikanischen organisierten verbrechens ist
5996765 wenn in dem bericht vom angeblich oft xenophoben umgang mit ausl ndern durch parteien im wahlkampf die rede ist dann wird damit in erster linie die freiheitliche partei ins fadenkreuz genommen denn offenbar pa t es den damen und herren von cerd nicht in den kram da sich die fp als einzige politische kraft im lande der autochthonen bev lkerung sterreichs verpflichtet f hlt und nicht dem politisch korrekten dogma der multikulturellen gesellschaft

5996905 it is very interesting and exciting to see how rapidly carrie and the band have progressed since we recorded their first project this project displays a versatility maturity and focus that is not often seen in a band just entering their third year they came in on this project with some really good material and i think we were able to get the most out of everything we tried this album covers a lot of really exciting musical ground and i am happy to see it being received so well at retail
5996906 energetic and crisp chhr 2 is a hard driving bluegrass album that showcases one of the most talented and imaginative sets of musicians in the genre today
5996907 if you are to write on religion then you are supposed to touch on matters pertaining to questions on rituals adherence to god followers and anything related to your divine mission
5996908 if you go beyond that definitely you have committed some breaches
5996909 u ltimately the interpretation of what constitutes religious matters should be left to the leaders and adherents of the faith
5996910 in line with the teachings of the catholic church in social and political charity
5996911 the home ministry is not in a position to dictate to the catholics or for that matter the proponents of any other faith the scope of their religion
5996912 in seeking to control the contents of the herald the home ministrys warning and show cause letters go against article 3 1 article 10 1 a and article 11 3 a of the federal constitution that is the right to freely practise ones religion the general freedom of speech and expression and the right of a religious group to manage its own affairs
5996913 such controls will deprive the catholic community of current information and education in relation to their faith such an act by the authorities is tantamount to curtailment of religious freedom
5996914 nothing more than the fulfillment of acts of worship and the observance of a few moral obligations
5996915 the dichotomy between the faith which many profess and their day to day conduct
5996916 no matter our national racial ethnic economic or ideological differences we have a global commitment to love our neighbors and to work for justice
5996917 we also have a commitment to work towards a just even and fair development of our world where no one society is exalted materially above the rest and no other society is left quite literally in the dust development must respect the rights of all nations and their people always promoting the moral cultural and spiritual dimensions of each person
5996918 good news to the poor liberty to captives and new sight to the blind
5996919 t he members of the church as members of society have the same right and duty to promote the common good as do other citizens christians ought to fulfill their temporal obligations with fidelity and competence they should act as a leaven in the world in their family professional social cultural and political life
5996920 international conference on religion in the quest for global justice and peace
5996921 in broadening public understanding of religion and its role in promoting justice and peace
5996922 our religious education should convince us that the dignity and integrity of all human beings is worthy of our respect religion should inculcate a truly universal and inclusive outlook not a mentality that is narrow exclusive and parochial
5996923 the need to amplify the role of the media in promoting a universal and inclusive dimension of religion that focused upon justice and peace
5996924 journalists and media practitioners in general should deepen and broaden their understanding of religion in order to play a more effective role in advancing the universal values of justice peace and compassion which lie at the heart of our great religious philosophies
5996925 nowhere in the country is the sector kept out of the purview of the strike
5996926 for reasons that they do not fully understand and that no one with the united states government will explain they are stopped at airports and border crossings they are singled out and embarrassed in front of fellow airline passengers their belongings are searched and they are detained for several hours at a time and the government will not tell them why their experiences however indicate that they are being retaliated against because of their religious activities and their muslim faith
5996927 the problem is people end up on these watch lists they dont know why theyve been put on it and they cant figure out how to get off them because the government wont respond

5996933 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
5996934 were on our way out of office the way things look now the last confrontation between us and the bad guys will have been one that they won we cant let our term end that way this cant be the last word we have to go out in a blaze of glory where should we set off that blaze iran of course no country has taunted us more relentlessly by bombing iran we will send the world a defiant farewell message forget russia we still rule

5996951 nehalem will be the backbone of intel for years to come
5996952 higher performance and energy efficiency are not mutually exclusive if you innovate enough
5996953 when you go into performance versus energy there is a trade off argument we dont want to have that argument
5996954 we want to give you a race car that gives you the miles per gallon of an economy car
5996955 as much as we get more efficient in how we use the battery were always finding more ways to leech off the battery
5996956 a lot of these technologies that will be living on the periphery like wimax are going to be pretty battery hungry
5996957 their overall story about the increasing graphics intensity running on our desktops i think thats absolutely true
5996958 of course military and technical cooperation is the main issue weapons purchases are very important
5996959 i think we should speed it up moreover the west and israel continue to put pressure on russia

5996961 existem problemas de concorr ncia em cada um dos sete aeroportos explorados pela baa o que tem consequ ncias negativas para passageiros e companhias a reas
5996962 as infra estruturas urbanas est o em total degrada o quase em ruptura e os autarcas preferem ocupar se a propiciar negociatas aos seus apoiantes
5996963 this is sort of equivalent to a peace deal or something its one of the big big contracts in history as far as social cultural political changes that came from this group being together
5996964 technology is a tool to address some of the worlds most pressing challenges related to health care education economic development and the environment
5996965 no nations or individuals are untouched by these issues get involved be part of the solution
5996966 it was a thoughtful piece focusing on what technology can do rather than focusing on 45 nanometre technology
5996967 intel will have plenty of opportunity to talk about products and technology he was trying to raise the level over individual products
5996968 it was certainly crafted to hit some hot button issues
5996969 this is part of a larger recognition and effort by large it vendors that they need to do more to encourage innovation around the world
5996970 typically the first thing consumers do with internet radio is plug it into their hi fi to get fantastic sound but now with the rdi w you dont have to
5996971 whether you want to listen to the latest hiphop from la detroit techno or cuban salsa rdi w gives you easy access to global radio in hi fi quality sound
5996972 nicecast and dj 1800 could have been made for each other this new version makes it easy to show off your mixing skills to the world and were really excited to bring hercules rmx support to dj 1800 with its rock solid build quality microphone talk over feature and four channel sound card its no surprise that the new rmx is already one of the most popular dj controllers around
5996973 this is a good move for intel and its good for customers that intel is making the move
5996974 it will speed development of solid state drive ssd technology and drop the cost smaller pc manufacturers will be able to buy pre integrated ssd drives that will seamlessly slide right into current laptop and desktop designs which means no additional redesign or development cost
5996975 on the plus side they are faster smaller and can take less power they arent mechanical and are thus more reliable than regular hard drives
5996976 the downside is that currently they are more expensive over time the price of ssds will come down but i believe most users will eventually have systems that utilize both ssds and traditional hard drives a decent sized ssd will give a speed boost while the regular hard drive will store the bulk of the data
5996977 we do think that flash is the technology being abused
5996978 because it does have a facility to put content into peoples clipboards
5996979 the attackers have somehow managed to insert malicious adverts into the system
5996980 if youre in an instant message conversation with someone and they say heres that link i was talking about youre more likely to believe its legitimate its very cunning
5996981 when i say taking over my clipboard i mean it appears on my clipboard and cant be removed
5996982 whenever i paste thats what gets pasted if i copy something else and then paste whatever i copied isnt actually copied and that string is what gets pasted
5996983 if someone replies to an mail they paste from the clipboard and get the url maybe they catch it maybe not likewise with blog posts guestbooks comments facebook etc theyre hoping that when you paste you paste their crap and it gets through
5996984 we havent seen anything like this before where a company scores 10 points over its nearest rival
5996985 there was a question mark last year about apple that maybe it had taken its eye off the ball by concentrating on the iphone but now the iphone and ipod and mac are nicely aligned
5996986 most of apples windows based competition is suffering a bit from vista
5996987 complaints about vista are generating complaints about the computer makers
5996988 people know there have been some service and product quality problems but apple has an almost teflon like quality its problems dont really seem to matter to consumers
5996989 most lose it slowly like dell has which took a while and we see companies improve but apples extreme volatility is almost like its stock price
5996990 apple will be very difficult to catch but i dont think that these results where theres a ten point difference will hold
5996991 my guess is that they will regroup at some point and come back
5996992 you agree not to install use or run the apple software on any non apple labeled computer or to enable others to do so
5996993 recently our sales team has received several inquiries as to whether or not our systems are still available
5996994 customers who purchased open computing products with apples os x leopard will receive a disc that will allow them to reinstall their os should something go drastically wrong or if they feel like getting a new start
5996995 the big cache and six cores will give customers a nice bump in performance
5996996 it looks like at least from the benchmarks were seeing that six core chips offer more performance than quad cores so yes customers are going to want them what we dont know is how much power the chips consume and how much heat they will dissipate and those are key concerns but all in all this is a pretty big advance in the state of the art and all the major vendors are on board
5996997 these chips outperform anything amd has and probably win on price performance too this could cut amds share of the server market considerably
5996998 intel doesnt have to crank up chip performance right now to thwart amd
5996999 their current products handily outperform amd on server products from my own research i can tell you that x86 server customers have moved away from amd and towards intel so intel didnt need to release this stuff now to catch up to amd or to top them but theyre doing it anyway just to keep the pressure up on amd and on themselves
5997000 if software cant take advantage of it what does it buy you
5997001 you still have software partitioning issues and when you put more cores on a chip you have to run it slower or increase the power consumption budget or thermal limitations
5997002 you pay x dollars per session and you can only use it at a few locations
5997003 the explosion of free sites is really driving the market
5997004 wifi grows like a weed it shows up in areas you never expect
5997005 operators have started bundling hotspot access with other services such as fixed and mobile broadband
5997006 this way consumers can access hotspots without paying a separate fee and operators can generate some access revenue by bundling the cost of the service into a bigger service package that consumers are willing to purchase
5997007 hotspot owners are still charging if they control a prime location like airports where there is no alternative
5997008 it is hard for them to just walk away from that revenue stream even if it will decline
5997009 the key idea in power management is quite simple to shut things off when not in use
5997010 were losing money as it is the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money
5997011 we are doing everything in our power to make sure this doesnt happen again
5997012 i think youve gotten a serious black eye today we were finally getting management happy with the idea of using esx for production servers and this set us back
5997013 either these machines were downgraded by sellers like dell or hp or they were downgraded by the user after they got the machine
5997014 in any case these machines are no longer running vista
5997015 the 35 percent is only an estimate but it shows a trend within our own user base
5997016 vistas installed base certainly doesnt equal the number of vista licences that microsofts sold
5997017 this shows that taking direct steps against infringers is an important and effective weapon in the battle against online piracy
5997018 low key operator making sure the company runs smoothly behind the scenes

5997020 which form of goji berries is best for me dried goji berries or goji juice
5997021 crossing back into washington on the back road from priest lake to metaline falls i was struck by dinos campaign billboards and the bottom line dont let seattle steal this election
5997022 once across rainy pass seattle thievery was forgotten in favor of just listing rossis gop affiliation is it possible somehow that we have a candidate preaching disdain for seattle on the dry side but not over here
5997023 coming through pomeroy there was a billboard for the gops candidate for governor
5997024 it said dont let seattle steal this election so much for being a guv of all the people
5997025 those are not official dino rossi for governor campaign signs
5997026 we had nothing to do with creating them and we dont agree with their message we do not believe that seattle or anyone else will steal this election
5997027 a heartless power hungry she wolf who would eat her own young
5997028 what supporters will buy with their support is a fair hearing i will give to everyone
5997029 this is my campaign ill talk about the issues i want to
5997030 our success is illustrated by the popularity of applications such as mywaves which has seen more than four million downloads worldwide but has thus far been denied visibility on apples app store
5997031 we can control masses of people to perform precisely and powerfully
5997032 give us your money and well diversify it for you

5997057 while there could be grounds to consider raising building heights in some localities this should be done within a holistic and well thought out plan that would cause the least environmental impact on the localities involved

5997070 die aktuelle vcd auto umweltliste zeigt dass viele fahrzeuge auf dem markt sind die einen akzeptablen verbrauch haben und bei l rm und schadstoffen gut abschneiden autok ufer haben also die wahl wenn sie umweltschonend und sparsam unterwegs sein wollen
5997071 w hrend es gerade mal ein deutsches fabrikat unter die top ten schafft dominieren neun pkw aus deutschland klar die umweltbesten kompaktautos
5997072 wir hatten das fahrzeug in unser umweltranking aufgenommen weil uns die daimler ag verbindlich zugesichert hatte dass der diesel smart ab oktober endlich serienm ig mit einem geschlossenen partikelfilter gegen krankmachenden dieselru ausgeliefert wird

5997074 current market conditions have led to the further weakening of the us dollar which coupled with the strengthening of the euro and many other currencies has caused significant changes in this years rankings
5997075 although the traditionally expensive cities of western europe and asia still feature in the top 20 cities in eastern europe brazil and india are creeping up the list conversely some locations such as stockholm and new york now appear less costly by comparison
5997076 our research confirms the global trend in price increases for certain foodstuffs and petrol though the rise is not consistent in all locations
5997077 keeping on top of the changes in expatriate cost of living is essential so companies can ensure their employees are compensated fairly and at competitive rates when stationed abroad
5997078 in some cases cost of living increases may be correlated to countries with a high rate of economic growth companies may assign high priority to expansion in these economies but may have to deal with inflationary pressures due to competition for expatriate level housing and other services as observed in our surveys
5997079 moscows position as the most expensive place for expatriate living has been strengthened by the appreciation of the rouble against the us dollar and the continuous rising accommodation costs
5997080 norwegian property prices were at an all time high towards the end of last year after a 50 increase in the last five years coupled with the continuous strengthening of the norwegian krone this has created a substantial increase in living costs for expatriates in oslo
5997081 in contrast to the strengthening euro and other european currencies the british pound has remained relatively stable against the us dollar as the cost of living in the eurozone has risen relative to the us uk cities have declined in the rankings
5997082 the decline in the ranking of all us cities is due to the weakening value of the us dollar against most major world currencies
5997083 the dollar has been declining steadily for the past several years which has resulted in an overall decrease in the cost of living in 19 us cities relative to other major global cities studied
5997084 on the bright side the us dollars loss of value may serve to attract globally mobile executives to business centres such as new york chicago and los angeles the difference in cost of living can be significant particularly for those executives with families
5997085 our clients success is very important to us so when our clients are in need of a site re design or new platform its imperative to be able to recommend a trusted web development company that specializes in e commerce websites

5997094 wiffiti definitely resonated with the crowd and pumped up the energy level for the 21 34 demographic the interactivity of text messaging is second nature which makes it a perfect complement to our digital jukeboxes at events like this
5997095 it was fun to see the personality of the audience really emerge on the screens
5997096 it was cheeky but intense and certainly amusing of course there were a few token spinal tap references what air guitar event would be complete without them

5997100 there comes a point where to grant a further indulgence to a party who has not put their house in order is to deny the other party its rights
5997101 its a strange thing that pearce did not know of a hearing on the very day a message was received from someone puporting to be her sister
5997102 she has had more than ample time to put before the court whatever evidence was available to her
5997103 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5997104 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5997105 coupling the two you have slow growth with higher inflation
5997106 created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now
5997107 this big push is making people crazy thinking theyre bad moms if they dont get their kids vaccinated
5997108 merck lobbied every opinion leader womens group medical society politicians and went directly to the people it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now
5997109 i would have liked to see it go much slower
5997110 this kind of money could be better used to solve so many other problems in womens health
5997111 im not against vaccines but in canada and the u s women are not dying in the streets of cervical cancer
5997112 but i was always skiing by myself and always felt a little scared
5997113 and once i thought for sure i saw bear tracks and i thought oh god i might get eaten alive out here and no ones going to know where i am
5997114 and because of how ugly the uglies got my family asked me not to do it i was bitter i was stressed out i was pushing myself so hard i was pushing to exhaustion
5997115 its been a whole new world and its been beautiful to learn about these skill sports
5997116 that was one of the paradigms i was trying to break with this goal can you learn a sport in less than 10 years
5997117 if you are an experienced athlete who trains four hours a day six days a week and focuses every minute on your technique does it still take you 10 years like coaches say it does i didnt know if i could do it even on friday im not sure im going to show that i accomplished that
5997118 it might take a couple of pulls to get me started

5997121 i used to love to be around people but i found myself keeping to myself a lot more i didnt trust people much mostly i was upset with the way the case was handled by the police
5997122 they kept telling me they had to wait until they had a better case and i kept telling them lets not wait until its too good a case i just wondered why they couldnt do their job
5997123 i over analyze things i have too high expectations for myself its weird because i do believe we were put on this earth to enjoy our lives and there is this side of me that wants to get on with my life and just relax and enjoy

5997134 this is the last friendly before the qualifiers and there will not be a lot of experiments but i have the possibility to get to know better some players like emile heskey
5997135 it is the first time ive picked him in the squad i followed him last season for three or four games and he didnt play well and for me was not fit
5997136 but i saw his last game and he is fit now and looked in very good form i think he is an interesting player but i must stress the door is not closed for peter crouch

5997142 ill sit here and say we have to qualify for the world cup and nothing more simple as that

5997161 we realized there was such interest and excitement in these categories to do with height that it was too important a category for us to leave it to a doctor alone
5997162 so we decided to tighten things up completely to make sure there was no doubt
5997163 he has gone on record saying he doesnt want to be bothered basically he doesnt want the fame and publicity that comes with being the worlds tallest man

5997172 immerhin ist der entscheidende ansatz bei der virtualisierung auch nicht die technik selbst sondern die ver nderung der prozesse
5997173 dadurch sind sie derzeit erst selten bestandteil der grundlegenden it strategien m ssen dort aber unbedingt ber cksichtigt werden
5997174 den strategischen nutzen von virtualisierung realisieren heute nur wenige unternehmen weil die konsequente integration in die gesamtorganisation noch gar nicht oder nur teilweise erfolgt
5997175 die virtualisierung wird heute meist taktisch oder gar als reiner probleml ser eingesetzt weil der erforderliche business kontext f r diese technologie nicht geschaffen wird

5997178 the boe are increasingly concerned about the outlook for growth while the near term worries about inflation are offsetting this for now
5997179 nonetheless with commodity prices having fallen substantially and the labour market downturn intensifying we believe that these inflation fears should subside in coming months

5997186 notorious for being focal and sporadic so finding one relatively small area that has higher transmission activity than other areas is more normal than abnormal
5997187 you put all these complicated factors together and in certain circumstances you could wind up with a situation that promotes more virus activity
5997188 so they have the knowledge to allow them to respond appropriately
5997189 it may be reassuring to know that that many people probably have immunities because they were infected in the past but never got sick
5997190 frankly this is beginning to look like its based mostly on myth not data
5997191 parents should think twice before sending their teens to these colleges or any others that have waved the white flag on underage and binge drinking policies
5997192 thats absurd and it basically says lets not talk about it
5997193 what this movement calls for is a national discussion it doesnt recommend a policy
5997194 students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5997195 if kids are able to handle themselves responsibly then why not
5997196 i know all over the world it is like 18 some places 16 in canada its 19 i always thought 21 was a weird number at 18 youre old enough to join the army and die but you cant drink a beer
5997197 itll keep kids out of trouble i think college kids are responsible enough to take care of themselves
5997198 they shouldnt be able to drink if theyre seniors in high school if i was allowed to drink when i was 18 i definitely would have gotten drunk every day after high school it would have been bad news
5997199 it would be much better to say youre 18 now
5997200 as the mother of a daughter who is close to entering college it is deeply disappointing to me that many of our educational leaders would support an initiative without doing their homework on the underlying research and science
5997201 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5997202 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all

5997205 it was a good game to win but it could easily have gone against us
5997206 the game appeared to be slipping away from us but we kept plugging away right to the end the win was a nice reward for the lads who have worked so hard this season
5997207 considering we didnt win a game a couple of seasons ago we have come a long way since then and i think there is still more to come from this team

5997229 this is a very exciting time for everyone in the business as we return to independence
5997230 crown is an extremely strong brand that is experiencing sales growth and it is essential that we remain competitive in current trading conditions
5997231 supported by a significant level of investment behind the business
5997232 hes got some power he can catch and throw and calls a good game
5997233 hes been trying to hit the ball the other way and stay through the ball and hes getting better at that hes cut down on his strikeouts hes a veteran guy
5997234 he does a good job on defense calling the game and handling the pitchers
5997235 at the same time were not hitting hes got to be better than a 220 hitter but if everyone was hitting i think ruiz would be hitting more if everyone else was hitting we wouldnt even be talking about ruiz
5997236 i think it would be asking a lot of a young catcher and it might be a lot to ask of a veteran catcher
5997237 some guys have that knack but those guys might be hard to find
5997238 typically with veteran guys it would be much easier to do if you can catch you can catch its just a matter of how much information you can retain from the pitching coach and other sources besides if we bring a catcher in it doesnt mean hes going to play every day
5997239 it will give us another guy on the bench greg dobbs or eric bruntlett and feliz defense
5997240 this guy can get some big hits for you i think he can hit more if we work with him a little bit more and the more confidence he gets i think hell hit more id like to see him get more aggressive and be more consistent with his swing
5997241 all the information that we get those scouts sit up there for a reason
5997242 the biggest difference i see you see guys chasing balls in the dirt chasing balls out of the strike zone things like that to me thats the difference
5997243 thats how you go to school on the hitter until you make adjustments more than likely theyre going to stay there some teams pitch us different but the majority of them throw us slow stuff before when they came at us with hard stuff wed light them up
5997244 les suppl ments de vitamine d pr viennent le cancer
5997245 were going to try to get quintin a majority of the reps
5997246 im never uncomfortable catching passes because ive done it before ive never done that before so im just a little more excited to make a play because you want to prove to yourself first that you can do it you forget the small stuff when you get excited it was one of those games i made kick return look like it was rocket science
5997247 i guess i might be a little biased because hes a safety but ive liked what ive seen demps do
5997248 i think hes a playmaker back there in the secondary hes going to have to work on his eyes a little bit hes in the backfield too much but i think thats because hes always trying to make a play on the ball i think hes a guy that has impressed me with his athleticism also
5997249 he has the right mentality for it hes not a prima donna nothing like that he comes in and he works hard
5997250 he adds so much to your return game in terms of speed and ability
5997251 get it and go thats what youve got to do punt return more of a little hesitation to see where the hole might be kickoff return youve got to catch it and get vertical
5997252 youve got to find a thin line between your responsibility and looking at the quarterback so long
5997253 being young you try to make a play so much thats all you try to do is make a play for me coming from college thats all i did was stare into the backfield and make plays by anticipating throws you cant do that in this league man its totally impossible its too fast the speed is too much and youve got to be technique sound
5997254 its the hardest thing for a young defensive back to come into the league with all the little techniques
5997255 quintins going to be a good football player hes got some habits and were correcting that one of the corrections is to make sure he concentrates on the receivers hes in a learning process too its going to take him a little while but im very happy with quintin
5997256 you have to have an individual who first of all you trust to do both and then that individual has to be of a mind set to not be afraid to do one or the other
5997257 some people are afraid to get into contact so thats why safety is out for them and some people are scared to get out there in corner what we call the highway out there because of that speed
5997258 it takes an individual with athletic ability absolutely but you have to have a mental toughness about you also to be able to step out there and line up against receivers out there on that highway and hold your own ive always given every corner that ive played with i give them a whole bunch of credit for lining up out there and doing what they do its a grown mans job at any given time you can get taken deep and you have to have a short memory to be able to line up again
5997259 he looks pretty good hes an excellent player i have noticed no rust
5997260 he is a natural player hes a big guy strong very fast very quick he plays the game natural meaning with instinctive athleticism he plays it naturally low he can bend his knees and he plays the game low its good to have shawn back hes working hard and preparing hard well see what happens here i would expect him to play very well
5997261 im not exactly where i would normally be at this point in camp
5997262 i would normally be in better football shape theres no type of running in the world that you can possibly do to match with football i trained with a 20 pound vest this offseason still once you put the pads on and everything else its different its a lot different
5997263 i do feel like myself im getting back into it mentally i know all my plays physically i feel pretty good id like to think im playing at new england but well see
5997264 its just a matter of seeing it believing it and just working at it and achieving it the guy who went 0 1 at the world championships just won the olympic title
5997265 bob and i are starting up a new business back in baltimore with the pool that we just bought
5997266 so were going to make some adjustments and see what we can do to take that sport to the next level
5997267 i won this for her for friends and family but mostly for her
5997268 it really calmed me down it made me think you can give any little extra energy any piece of yourself you have left you dont have to save anything johnson said
5997269 going into that last routine i didnt care what score i got i just wanted to hit the best routine i could to finish off my experience and not have any regrets
5997270 i didnt want to leave here thinking i could have done better finishing off that routine knowing i hit the best routine i could at the time it felt amazing
5997271 she tumbles on the beam like other people tumble on the floor
5997272 you read the papers they say we have no chance even in the nfc
5997273 but it really doesnt matter what people say as long as the 53 guys we go into the season with believe in ourselves and we go out there and play giants football well be fine i know a lot of people are saying theres no michael strahan no jeremy shockey no gibril wilson no kawika mitchell but weve got guys who stepped in last year and played a lot they will continue to do that and i feel confident in our coaching staff and the people we have around here to get it done
5997274 we had one pro bowler last year osi umenyiora defensive end was our only pro bowler so were not sexy we dont have all the big names and that kind of stuff
5997275 were kind of a blue collar team and i think it does put a little bit of a chip on our shoulder to hear people say you know what last year was a fairy tale itll never happen again well these guys want to prove that it can
5997276 were definitely going to miss him said umenyiora who had a career high 13 sacks last season six of which came in a 16 3 week 4 win over the eagles
5997277 whenever you take a hall of famer out of your defense its going to affect you tremendously he was a great player i dont know if anybody is going to be able to step up the way he played we have good football players but were talking about michael strahan here
5997278 having those two guys on the outside was tremendously important
5997279 it was basically pick your poison you had three guys that can get after the quarterback obviously we didnt sack him every time but just having that threat that capability gets a quarterback off his timing off his rhythm
5997280 you could tell the week of the super bowl how we felt said umenyiora
5997281 we felt we could beat that football team we felt we could get to brady when we played them in week 17 we hit him 17 times they had a very good offensive line but we felt we were a better defensive line so we just went out there and tried to do what we do
5997282 we still have a lot of people who can rush the passer umenyiora said
5997283 you take michael out of the equation obviously youre losing a great player but i think kiwanuka can rush the passer so can dave tollefson we have some guys who can step in there and do a good job
5997284 i am having a blast there at the olympic village
5997285 the workers have been pretty aggressive about getting autographs and photos but the other athletes have respected me its a different experience than staying in a hotel
5997286 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race
5997287 its just a shame that it happened on the biggest race of my life
5997288 i was already getting up and elated coming off the turn
5997289 i was getting breakfast and thought ah i just dont want to talk to her today so i bumped it
5997290 then two seconds later there was a message from nicole wishing us good luck
5997291 i ended up returning her call she was very happy
5997292 she was very surprised that we do have a tradition of naming our boats after her movies and shes just really stoked to be part of a team
5997293 sharon called him and he showed the caller id to everyone shes really into him and even asked him to come with her to mexico
5997294 in terms of preparing them for the world we need to redefine our attitudes towards traditional ideas of cheating unless the students have a conceptual understanding of the topic or what they are working on they cant access bits and pieces of information to support them in a task effectively
5997295 in their working lives they will never need to carry enormous amounts of information around in their heads
5997296 what they will need to do is access information from all their sources quickly and they will need to check the reliability of their information
5997297 that which doesnt kill you is an opportunity to turn to jesus
5997298 no im really conscientious i can do both just fine
5997299 i dont care how much evidence is presented im going to talk on the phone in the car because my need to have this conversation outweighs any concern i may have about exits i may miss accidents i may cause or stupid driving mistakes i make
5997300 jessica went from a size 8 to a size 4 pretty quickly
5997301 the baby always comes first but jessica definitely set goals for herself
5997302 tell me sweetie what is the weather like in england im not used to the cold any more ive got so used to the heat in asia
5997303 im so happy to be going back to england ive been waiting for this day a long long time
5997304 england is my home its where my heart is and where my family are i cant wait to see them god bless them all
5997305 god am i happy to be leaving vietnam and that jail i should never have been in there it has been a nightmare every second i was set up thats all i will say
5997306 but you wait all the time ive been inside ive been preparing for my book its all here in my head
5997307 im an innocent man and my book will show you that im not worried at all about coming home to england
5997308 why would i be im an innocent man i think people realise that i think ill be made welcome thats all i will say take care of yourself
5997309 the package will create a balance between the powers of the president and the prime minister
5997310 ppp co chairman asif zardari insisted on the minus one formula which is restoration of all sacked judges except iftikhar muhammad chaudhry
5997311 the ppp wanted the reinstatement of judges minus one through a constitutional package but the pml n insisted that they should be all restored through an executive order within three days as agreed already
5997312 the anp and the jui f tacitly endorsed the ppp point of view
5997313 howard is a right end theres no question about it
5997314 but we are going to work him in a little bit at left because hes a good pass rusher
5997315 mcdougle is pushing hes got two more preseason games so well know more then
5997316 this has become one of those situations where theres competition between mcdougle and chris clemons
5997317 we have to get chris back on the field until we get him back on the field were just not going to know
5997318 i just want to stay focused on staying on the field
5997319 thats been the biggest thing in my whole career the injuries
5997320 as long as i stay on the field and play up to my potential everything else is going to fall into place im not there yet i just want to keep improving
5997321 it sets you back a lot when you cant go out and compete and be at the top of your game stay in shape and practice
5997322 we need as many healthy players as we can get right now
5997323 when ive been out there its been going well ive been able to pick up the defense ive been able to go out and show some of the things im capable of doing show some of the reasons they brought me in here its unfortunate the injury has come at a critical time
5997324 i think its just hey the best players are going to play
5997325 i can say i think hes come a long way
5997326 when leo was in high school he was a linebacker after we recruited him he never played above 250 or 255 pounds but he was quick as a cat
5997327 but theyre the same kind of people excellent students very prideful to do well no matter what challenge you give them they take it on i think stefens going to be an outstanding offensive lineman
5997328 i had a chance to get in there and feel comfortable going into this year i feel like i know my way around i think i know what to expect
5997329 i like to do a lot of extra stuff after we run after we lift
5997330 but stefen does extra on top of extra thats something that really sets him apart his work ethic is phenomenal he has that drive and desire to be great
5997331 leo never quite got the credit he should have gotten because we had a lot of other good kids when he was here like sean farrell and mike munchak who were no 1 draft picks
5997332 but when we played southern cal in the 1982 fiesta bowl they had two or three kids bruce matthews and a couple of other guys who ended up being all pros they havent blocked leo yet leo made more plays that day than you could shake a stick at and was voted the games outstanding defensive player after the lions 26 10 victory
5997333 i wanted to look around and make sure i was going to the place where id best fit in i liked boston college a lot but their coaches left right when i was being recruited so that made it easy i think i would have come here anyway
5997334 i mean whats not to like its a positive that my dad and my uncle were here i walk by their pictures on the wall every day and it makes me smile
5997335 why doesnt google have a link on the gmail front page letting people know about the existence of the ssl option
5997336 cnet blogger christopher soghoian writes in to note that the bigger issue is that the https option has been there since gmail debuted in a private beta in 2004 but that only the security kids really know about the option
5997337 am i crazy i thought that option was always there
5997338 but it doesnt surprise you because you see stuff like that in baseball all the time
5997339 im figuring two grand in camden aint gonna cut it too much
5997340 we were going to have to live with my parents
5997341 i thought maybe ill get another eye looking at me
5997342 youre hanging on every pitch one run means everything youre not going to get any tougher situation
5997343 ive only had a couple of people say boo back to me
5997344 it still hurts a little that he used the word front runners book said had evolved into what he said was a sincere attempt to get fans at the ballpark to be more positive
5997345 you had some cheers you had some boos i guess
5997346 thats what i said it was pretty much going to be again like i said if we get the win theyll be cheering
5997347 i was speaking for a lot of guys i wasnt just speaking for ryan ryans had his share ive had my share pat burrell has had his share i think chase utley hasnt been touched and hopefully it remains that way
5997348 a lot of times and ive actually heard it they dont want to put their family and kids in a situation where they come to the field and these are the types of things their kids are going to have to sit through and listen to thats just the truth those arent my words those are words that ive actually heard
5997349 but it could have been worse in my opinion i saw people standing up for j roll i heard some claps even though its pretty hard to hear way up here
5997350 im glad i did it im still hoping it catches on some more i mean who knows
5997351 ive not really had a whole lot to say to tell you the truth
5997352 as to when ill be back on the practice field thats still to be determined obviously the sooner the better for me my goal is to be back for the first game
5997353 this maybe will stop some of the whining going on
5997354 i just didnt want to get into these daily progress reports ive done nothing but rehab i guess were sort of in the rumor mill now i dont wear a knee brace i wore this wrap today really for the first time
5997355 if were to the point of someone putting a cell phone picture on the news thats a little disappointing so i guess ill squash that right now its not true i dont wear a knee brace
5997356 i dont know if any of those injured guys will be out there on sept 7 but my guess is they will be

5997364 i was just ecstatic going on off a walkoff at the little league world series
5997365 we stay in the olympic family under these humiliating terms only because we value the precious international recognition through sports something we can never think of in power play diplomacy
5997366 i think it is a great pity that baseball has been dropped from the olympic games
5997367 it was a great promotion for us as long as we were playing baseball in the olympics countries paid attention to us
5997368 everywhere we go we speak the same language and see familiar faces
5997369 personal lectura de la obra de william shakespeare en la que hamlet ya no va llorando por los pasillos del palacio el asesinato de su padre sino que es un joven airado y muy cabreado
5997370 fija su atenci n en dos reflexiones sobre el poder y las relaciones de familia y refleja por un lado el poder que va triturando a todo aquel que se acerca a su corrupto coraz n y por otro muestra a un hamlet incapaz de estar a la altura de su padre
5997371 es un texto soberbio obra clave de la dramaturgia de shakespeare salpicado de temas con calado sobre los que el espectador no puede dejar de reflexionar

5997396 you are asking me questions which you should really be asking the president and not me
5997397 he or his ministry had nothing to do with the deal but merely was called upon to give sign his ministerial consent to the deal
5997398 was no more than just an administrative part of his ministerial duties as the commerce minister
5997399 local businessmen signed with al jabiri this deal and they are the chief party who signed this deal with al jabiri
5997400 as to why he hasnt submitted to parliament this commercial agreement which the government businessmen signed with al jabiri in order for the house to ratify and endorse it as stipulated in the constitution
5997401 my duty and role as a cabinet minister is to submit the agreement to the council of ministers who then endorse it for the president to sign it and from there the president forwards the agreement for parliament to endorse or reject
5997402 his ministrys role in all this was to supervise sign parts of the agreement which concerned the livestock quarantine and veterinary facilities which according to the agreement al jabiri was going to build in berbera costing 5 million
5997403 no but the deal was implemented by the chamber of commerce and local livestock traders acting as representatives of the saudi businessman suleiman al jabiri
5997404 the government is the signatory party who had made this deal with al jabiri
5997405 deeply involved with al jabiri in a conspiracy to defraud the local livestock trade and its exporters out of millions of us dollars
5997406 the government has given al jabiri a virtual monopoly to the saudi market
5997407 only traders acting as al jabiri agents can export livestock to saudi arabia and no one else worse still the government has determined a fixed price of 38 per goat sheep to agents shipping the livestock on behalf of al jabiri to the saudi market we have export deals with other saudi livestock importers who have agreed to buy our livestock at a price of 60 70 per goat sheep yet we are forced by the government to sell our livestock to only one saudi livestock company al jabiri and this is at a fixed price of 38 per animal this is half of what weve been offered by other saudi competitors compared to price

5997461 i dont think i have pushed as hard as i should have but nicky shorey has done tremendous and he has made the window for me a tiny one
5997462 in a professional way for me to progress now he has gone he has left a big window for me
5997463 hopefully if i get the chance i can grab it with both hands
5997464 nicky shorey is a top class full back hes got england caps to prove that obviously i learned a lot watching him play and train so there was a positive element
5997465 but the only way for me to learn is by playing games i need to get as many games in as i can this season
5997466 we only really have one left back now so it is understandable if the manager gets someone in
5997467 it was good timing and bad timing with it being at the end of last season i didnt miss too much and luckily i wont miss much of this season
5997468 but it was bad in the sense that the left back spot is pretty open at the minute
5997469 hunty is doing a good job there hes put in two decent performances there but obviously its not his preferred position so there is a good opportunity for me in that spot this season
5997470 the injury had built up over a period of time and i kept playing and training with it wearing strapping
5997471 it seemed to be holding but one day in training it collapsed it set me back i was in a lot of pain i couldnt move off the sofa for four days
5997472 but i have come a long way since then its a little bit sore after the game but its not causing me any problems
5997473 that was my first game for nearly five months so its nice to be back
5997474 it was a bonus to put in a good performance but the main thing is i got through 90 minutes

5997509 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
5997510 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
5997511 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

5997538 thats fine for lots of acacias and eucalypt species but the fleshy fruits seeds such as lilly pillys generally cant be stored that way
5997539 i feel sad for our carer because now shes nervous about taking the kids out
5997540 often parents would ask carers to go to the post office or do something on the way home when they had kids in their care but the risk of these activities was not being assessed by the carer
5997541 i am responsible for the lives of these kids and if this new measure means postponing excursions till the appropriate paperwork is filled out or if some trips are cancelled because they are too unsafe then so be it
5997542 i was absolutely horrified by the letter because i try to do the right thing but now i cant even pick the kids up from school or go to playgroup without filling out a form
5997543 of course as a parent i want things to be safe but sometimes adults jump in too quickly and kids end up not learning how to deal with real life problems
5997544 family day care is often chosen by parents who want their children to interact with other kids have fun and be stimulated as close to home as possible

5997557 we are pleased to have won the game against slovenia this was an important game for us but well have to improve
5997558 there was some good aspects of the game but plenty to work on and were level headed enough to realise that we have stuff to improve on
5997559 it is always very difficult when you only have the players for two days and weve got two big matches coming up now
5997560 we have got the wembley match against portugal to finish the group and the play off game after that so it has been good to have a bit more contact time with the players
5997561 you learn something from every game at this level and well look at the game again on tape and see if we can change things if we need to when we see the players again
5997562 portugal will be a fantastic game they are strong side and we drew 1 1 out there in a hard fought match between the two of us
5997563 they have some good players in their ranks and can draw from the seniors with a few players like us that have been upgraded so it will be interesting how the game pans out
5997564 and of course the opportunity to play at wembley will be fantastic for the development of some of these players
5997565 the situation with him agbonlahor was that he played 90 minutes at the weekend and had tightened his groin a little bit in the warm up

5997577 all who are involved will get gods wrath and curse and will be put in hell forever
5997578 but i was wondering why those who kill over 200 people are afraid of facing the death penalty themselves
5997579 i think if we have a review of the status of the death penalty we have to review the overall system of punishment because we dont want to see for example someone who is involved in a serious murder be freed before the age of 50 or below 50 and continue to be a problem for the society
5997580 the possibility of the death penalty being abolished has to be balanced with a more adequate system of punishment

5997582 at present it costs about 63 000 a year to keep a person in prison so dr patel certainly is costing the state rather less than if he were in prison
5997583 while i can understand people might have question marks about them these are the requirements of international treaties and we have no choice but to meet those obligations
5997584 i think its relatively modest certainly as i understand it its comparable to if not cheaper than what it would have been costing if bail had been denied
5997585 the thing we all need to remember and queenslanders should not forget that none of this expense would have been necessary if the labor government hadnt originally flown patel out of australia one way business class

5997589 im not going to lecture school leaders about the decisions they make in their individual school but from the point of view of the national government what we want to see is rising standards we want to see educational excellence
5997590 we want a new era of transparency when it comes to whats happening in schools we want information publicly available about the students in our schools about the mix of abilities that they bring to school and we want more information available publicly about attainment in schools

5997600 entonces continu vel zquez es importante que se sepa que luego de todo lo que pas la misma prefectura a trav s de su encargado o m xima autoridad del lugar y en colaboraci n con el ministerio de trabajo de la provincia se lleg a un acuerdo en el que qued establecido que se concretar un padr n de personas en condiciones a trav s del convenio del sindicato de camioneros de ingresar al puerto

5997602 el acuerdo alcanzado es bueno y se enmarca en la pol tica de aplicaci n el sindicato vamos a luchar para que todos los trabajadores que est n en el marco del convenio de camioneros cobren como tales y est n totalmente en blanco no vamos a avalar el trabajo en negro de ninguna manera mal que les pese a los empresarios que intentan manejar el puerto de ushuaia

5997673 steel products are priced by a system of base prices and extras in general each producer specifies a base price for each product form that it manufactures for example a producer of carbon steel cold rolled sheets would specify a base price for that product in addition the producer specifies completely the range of thickness width and other properties that are covered by the base price if a customers requirements are for material thicker thinner wider or narrower than the base range an extra charge is added extras are also added for such requirements as cut length as opposed to sheets in coil form special drawing quality small orders e g less than 20 000 pounds of a single item and other requirements depending upon the product form the cost of transportation from the producer to the customer is a significant consideration as a result a producer often will adjust his price to match a customers delivered price from a more proximate producer when such an adjustment is made the customers cost is the same regardless of the location of the shipping mill the result for the steel producer is a lower realized price when shipping to a customer located closer to another producing mill steel prices are usually quoted by weight for many products however there is a provision for calculating the weight of a shipment so that a customer is required to pay only for the theoretical weight of the product rather than the actual weight which normally is more than the theoretical weight because of allowable manufacturing variations discounts from the quoted price are often available

5997718 while we accept that constraints on runway capacity in the south east will limit the scope for the benefits of competition in the short term we believe that separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
5997719 in scotland where there are no similar capacity constraints we believe separate owners of edinburgh and glasgow would similarly improve their offerings
5997720 in scotland baa has until recently been noticeably slow to develop new routes at glasgow and edinburgh while at aberdeen its investment plans are regarded as unambitious despite relatively high levels of profitability
5997721 we remain of the view that glasgow and edinburgh airports serve separate markets and that competition between the two is highly unlikely regardless of ownership
5997722 if glasgow or edinburgh airport is to be sold by baa any potential buyer must show a strong commitment to continued investment
5997723 i think it is giving the suggestion to the competition commission that if the ownership of glasgow and edinburgh is split similar developments would take place there

5997733 we have seen images of these towers on television and the internet and to now see them gone is a significant development like here the basque people want a peaceful solution to the conflict in our country despite this the spanish and french have continued in their campaign of repression torture and arrests we denounce these repressive acts which show the spanish and french belligerence to working on a meaningful peace process in the basque country
5997734 we look to the positive progress which has been made by the irish people through the good friday agreement and we are keen to study its successes
5997735 from past visits to the basque country i know that the basque struggle is our struggle we support the rights of the basque people to national self determination and delegations like this are important to keep the irish people informed of developments in the basque country
5997736 the current repression and human rights abuses against the basque youth are appalling and it is an inspiration that despite this torture they continue to mobilise confidently towards their objectives
5997737 the basque youth are one of the most inspiring and innovative movements globally we can learn many lessons from their vast experience and through visits like this we can enable them to learn from our struggle in ireland and for gra members to learn from theirs

5997739 within the last fortnight citizens have experienced extreme flooding which has created great hardship for families and huge inconvenience around the main centres of population in both dublin and belfast where motorways carrying major traffic flows have been disrupted
5997740 it is devastating for families and communities who have been worst hit by the extreme floods experienced over the weekend
5997741 the committee heard today from the various agencies engaged in the ongoing flood relief measures throughout the six counties including the roads service water service and the rivers agency

5997779 all who are involved will get gods wrath and curse and will be put in hell forever
5997780 but i was wondering why those who kill over 200 people are afraid of facing the death penalty themselves
5997781 i think if we have a review of the status of the death penalty we have to review the overall system of punishment because we dont want to see for example someone who is involved in a serious murder be freed before the age of 50 or below 50 and continue to be a problem for the society
5997782 the possibility of the death penalty being abolished has to be balanced with a more adequate system of punishment

5997805 while i can understand people might have question marks about them these are the requirements of international treaties and we have no choice but to meet those obligations
5997806 i think its relatively modest certainly as i understand it its comparable to if not cheaper than what it would have been costing if bail had been denied

5997817 its all to easily forgotten that wexford have presented us with problems in the past and it would be wrong to read too much into their leinster final display against dublin when they fell away badly after a promising first 35 minutes
5997818 certainly dublin were the overwhelming favourites when we travelled to croke park last saturday and rightly so weve been playing only well in patches whereas dublin had little bother in winning a fourth leinster title
5997819 and yet i always felt there was a big game in us and theres no better place to produce that than against dublin in croke park but there were certain factors that had a huge bearing on the match
5997820 alan brogan is a quality player and his loss early in the game was a massive blow to dublin
5997821 they then missed some good early chances including one for a goal and after that you could see mistakes creeping into their game
5997822 from our perspective it was encouraging that we were able to get goals and well worked goals at the right time the second just after dublin had scored theirs allowed us to go in at half time in a comfortable position and our third goal effectively finished off the match
5997823 we certainly werent 12 points a better side than dublin it was just on the day we got the breaks and that always helps

5997830 caller thank you i am so excited about talking to you and im so nervous i wanted to talk about a different aspect of obamas candidacy no one has touched on his very far left stance on social issues such as abortion and there was an incident here in illinois about seven years ago at christ hospital a suburban hospital to chicago where babies who were born alive after a botched abortion were left to die in linen closets and a nurse exposed it and she was of course fired and there were demonstrations and it led the illinois legislature to formulate the infants born alive act which stated that infants who were born alive as the result of a botched abortion could not be left to die and barack obama voted against it
5997831 obama well and because they have not been telling the truth and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
5997832 but in 2003 in the health committee which he chaired obama voted against a version of the bill that contained the specific

5997834 so far our fluorescent sensor technology has been used in blood diagnostic cassettes worldwide
5997835 if for example you have an accident and need blood an ambulance crew can analyse your blood at the scene and tell the a amp e unit to arrange for a certain type of blood with the necessary salt levels ready at the hospital for your arrival
5997836 now we have extended our sensor designs and discovered other possible uses one such use could be as an id tag for cells in an epidemic such as a bird flu outbreak from a population our sensor molecules could help track infection and highlight vulnerable people

5997872 people selling their homes need an epc before they have a buyer but the vast majority are under the illusion that they dont need one
5997873 an epc should be available from the get go if there are two or three similar houses a seller may not appreciate finding out during negotiations that there is more to do there than they initially thought it has the potential for renegotiation
5997874 some home owners have told us people have called at their door saying they can carry out an epc inspection
5997875 this has all the hallmarks of a scam and i would suggest to home owners not to invite these people into their home never mind give them money they will probably never see the epc

5997907 the history of wrecks is what people want to see at bristol wrecks fire flying sparks i have already turned it off and am watching a movie and playing on the internet some of my friends have left the track and texted me to go eat

5997909 people come to expect so much out of a race at bristol that sometimes we just cant live up to those expectations
5997910 if its not three wide one upside down and a helmet throwing finish then they feel like theyve got cheated
5997911 before it was when you had someone on your bumper you were worried the whole time especially if there was a train of cars
5997912 if you got knocked out of the way and moved up you might get passed by 10 or 12 cars
5997913 i think the racing is three times better its just the crashes dont happen as much
5997914 if everyone is running over the top of each other people are going to complain about that
5997915 now that there are places to pass people are going to complain about that
5997916 lets write a happy story about it they did a hell of a job on the racetrack and they should be commended for it the racing is good and it was really good at the first race this year just because you dont have 20 cautions in one race doesnt make it an abnormal bristol
5997917 maybe theres not going to be as many yellows and cars bumping and grinding and moving each other out of the way
5997918 but its not just your normal bump and grind that makes bristol special its pretty darn cool watching a stock car get around there in 15 seconds

5997952 these findings suggest that it is important children first learn how to calculate answers on their own but after that initial phase using calculators is a fine thing to do even for basic multiplication facts
5997953 the study indicates technology such as calculators can help kids who already have a strong foundation in basic skills
5997954 for students who did not know many multiplication facts generating the answers on their own without a calculator was important and helped their performance on subsequent tests
5997955 but for students who already knew some multiplication facts it didnt matter using a calculator to practice neither helped nor harmed them
5997956 teachers struggle with how to give kids immediate feedback which we know speeds the learning process so another use for calculators is allowing students to use them to check the answers they have come up with by themselves giving them immediate feedback and more time for practice
5997957 president musharraf had to resign after he played with the people

5997960 a vote for the alliance will not be a vote for the heroic soldiers it is clearly a vote for robbery corruption family administration and for hunger the alliance is trying to strengthen its family power as the people of the north central province suffer it wants to gain power by any means for five more years and swindle public money i should say that every vote for betel leaf will be a vote for robbery
5997961 if you want to vote for the heroic soldiers vote for the unp and elect the heroic janaka perera as chief minister

5997972 going forward the provincial winners should get a home tie in the quarter finals there has to be some reward a provincial medal is okay and its great to win it but theres not as much meas on it anymore
5997973 cork have a lot of big physical men and i think its going to be very tight
5997974 its totally frustrating especially after flogging yourself for eight weeks in pre season and then just when you start to look forward to the games this happens
5997975 things were going really well i played out in bayonne in a friendly the week before felt in great shape and was looking forward to getting on the field against western force
5997976 were 60 40 in favour of thursday going ahead and all the water has cleared off the track
5997977 weve got to tighten up the amateur programme so that in four years we do a whole lot better
5997978 the problem is that these days its all about money when its all about money this happens the guys the fighters are just thinking about money theres a kind of manipulation where the kids are being told go and turn pro gold medals arent important
5997979 the managers and promoters dont want the guys winning golds because then they have to pay them more
5997980 when you have a good amateur programme it helps develop well rounded boxers
5997981 look at the pro game now why do the championships change hands so quickly its because these guys dont know how to fight different styles
5997982 when youre a pro you avoid the fighters whose style doesnt suit your style it makes them weak amateur boxing is harder than pro you have to fight everybody in your draw
5997983 sergio is a good player but how do you continue to do what he does watson did it but watson did it at a young age two u s opens and a pga or two pgas and a u s open
5997984 but watson learned from that i should put this in a positive way watson was an awfully good putter and sergio it seems to be his nemesis
5997985 when youre a really good putter like harrington is you can make up for some errant shots
5997986 gary player used to have a terrible time finishing off tournaments but his short game was so great and he was such a good putter it didnt look like he was having trouble finishing it off because he didnt give it away
5997987 he was always able to find a way to get the ball in the hole and get it done and thats what a lot of guys do what harrington does and i did it on a lot of occasions
5997988 a lot of places i one putted five of the last six or seven greens to make sure i stayed in the tournament and got there and won
5997989 we can confirm donetsk have lodged a claim with fifa regarding this matter
5997990 you heard the fans i obviously have a very special relationship with them and ill always think very highly of the club
5997991 if i can start every game for united then obviously that would be ideal but i had a fantastic time here
5997992 it is similar to devices that used to be used in the province by other groups
5997993 whatever you say say nothin when you talk about you know what for if you know who should hear you you know what youll get
5997994 a number of cannabis plants in the form of a cannabis factory were discovered in the building the number of plants discovered is still being established and enquiries into the incident are ongoing
5997995 the department of health has forced a situation in which the minor ailments scheme has ceased with effect from july 31 2008
5997996 this is damaging to the progress of public health is bad news for the nhs and the taxpayer and is entirely avoidable it has ceased because the terms laid down by the department of health for the scheme after july 31 are unreasonable and unfair
5997997 the department of health are proposing a level of remuneration which is entirely unacceptable and proposes to cap the number of transactions that can be carried out under the scheme in a year above this cap there will be no consultation fee payable and so contractors will essentially be providing their services for no payment
5997998 the governments chief medical officer michael mcbride praised the scheme in his report this year for providing a valuable service
5997999 but they appear unwilling to fund it beyond a certain threshold it costs around 40 each time to visit a gp compared to around 10 to visit a pharmacy so already the scheme has potentially generated cash savings to the nhs in northern ireland of 8 05m
5998000 i felt that the offer from the department at the end of july was derisory that the cap is unworkable
5998001 the system is against the provincial champions and it shouldnt be like that
5998002 going forward the provincial winners should get a home tie in the quarter finals there has to be some reward a provincial medal is okay and its great to win it but theres not as much kudos on it anymore
5998003 cork have a lot of big physical men and i think its going to be tight i think kerry will nick it by two or three points but not by a margin bigger than that cork will have learned from previous mistakes against kerry at croke park and will look to keep it tight early on
5998004 im just focusing on staying on the field as long as im on the field and playing to my potential everything will fall into place
5998005 we have to get darren on the field as much as possible
5998006 hes having a good camp after that it becomes a competition between mcdougle and chris clemons for a roster spot
5998007 mcdougle has come a long way and hes performing well its tough for chris right now because hes not on the field until we get him back were not going to know if he is good enough to make the team
5998008 i learned a long time ago that the more things you can do to help the team the better off you are
5998009 moving from right to left is going to be an adjustment though it sounds like the same position but its really not its like asking a right handed batter in baseball to switch hit or for a right handed golfer to play left handed
5998010 the injuries have definitely set me back a little bit
5998011 when youre not able to get out there with the rest of the guys and mesh with them its tough to make progress
5998012 its frustrating but i know once i get on the field ill be ready to play
5998013 hes an excellent player i have noticed no rust he is a natural player hes a big guy strong very fast very quick
5998014 after mr cantrell died i took a little old mule he had and plowed me a vegetable garden and had plenty of vegetables to eat it was hard times you had to work to eat

5998017 once we seize control well take the majority of seats on the board and pay a dividend one for one in this new company
5998018 it makes sense at some point to spin the other assets out and give them a growth opportunity
5998019 we just happen to be in the middle of a takeover
5998020 this can be in fact a little spin out worth far more than its book value
5998021 following the share transfer indophil will retain not more than 20 per cent of new exploration
5998022 no doubt xstrata will take us to the takeovers panel and cry foul on all sorts of things
5998023 trotz finanzkrise und dem hohen risiko nehmen mergers amp acquisitions auch weiterhin zu unsere studie zeigt dass it kompetenz f r die entsprechenden prozesse insbesondere in branchen mit hohem konsolidierungsgrad wie dem handel zu finden sind auff llige defizite bestehen hingegen in den bereichen transport und verkehr energiewirtschaft und finanzdienstleistungen

5998025 most members of the committee judged that the current stance of monetary policy was broadly appropriate and that bank rate should be maintained at five per cent this month
5998026 inflation was likely to move further above the governments 2 0 per cent target in the coming months the outlook for activity growth had continued to worsen but some build up in the margin of spare capacity was likely to be necessary to ensure that inflation returned to the target in the medium term

5998035 our goal in release 1 0 is near perfect running of palm apps on symbian os devices if we changed the interface a lot of apps would break or look ugly as the spacing would be off we will be adding enhancements to the ui so palm apps can be updated to a more modern look and feel
5998036 symbian os devices come in a large variety of screen sizes heres a partial list 128 x 128 208 x 176 240 x 256 240 x 320 320 x 240 340 x 220 352 x 416 416 x 352 how can you design an app that will run the same way on all of them some are landscape some are portrait some rotate either way the best answer is to make your app square to fit in the intersection of the screen sizes ns basic symbian os uses a basic 160 x 160 grid to lay out your app if the screen is big enough pixels are multiplied by 1 5 to give 240 240 or by 2 to give 320 x 320 magnifications in between look terrible so we dont do them the result is that apps you create using ns basic symbian os will run on all current symbian os devices without change and will resize to take advantage of the largest square area that is available we are planning to add the ability to resize your app to the actual screen size to take advantage of this your app will have to query the screen size on startup then resize all the objects on the form to best take advantage of it this can rarely be done automatically laying out objects on a form almost always takes careful planning and design
5998037 we can confirm donetsk have lodged a claim with fifa regarding this matter
5998038 you have to get a buzz out of it alright and i did to win an award like that against the all ireland champions
5998039 but to be quite honest it was all about winning a munster title that was more important looking at things at half time it was difficult to see a way through to pull it out of the fire like we did we were just delighted after
5998040 i suppose thats how we will be judged we know what were up against we havent done as well as wed have liked against them
5998041 we didnt perform really results would show that even though going into the games we thought we could beat them its hard to say why theyre a very good side their results have proven that putting back to back all irelands together
5998042 i dont think there is baggage really obviously these things linger in your mind i was just a sub though certainly id remember the games but i dont think theres a whole load of baggage
5998043 tthis team has been going for the last four or five years weve an amount of experience weve got to a good few semi finals in a row a final last year so its no flash in the pan setanta readers comment of the day
5998044 i started looking into his life and the more i found out the more inspirational he became he was like something out of greek mythology
5998045 it would seem the only thing the dup sinn fein axis can agree on is finding new ways of wasting money and wasting time
5998046 has not incurred any expenditure in relation to this document to date
5998047 however the indication is that the cost of the preparatory work is likely to be between 7 000 and 8 000
5998048 the exact figure has yet to be agreed with the service provider and we will be invoiced accordingly
5998049 it is hardly surprising that during a period when the office of first minister and deputy first minister cannot agree to convene an executive committee meeting that they could not agree to produce a magazine
5998050 it is ironic that the provisional title of this magazine is changing times as for the people of northern ireland there is nothing new about dup and sinn fein bickering
5998051 it certainly seems like if we could get some of these vehicles over here wed be headed in a better direction
5998052 its definitely nice to get into the vehicles and actually see them and drive
5998053 were 60 40 in favour of thursday going ahead and all the water has cleared off the track
5998054 you heard the fans i obviously have a very special relationship with them and ill always think very highly of the club

5998056 sergio is a good player but how do you continue to do what he does watson did it but watson did it at a young age two u s opens and a pga or two pgas and a u s open

5998061 a lot of places i one putted five of the last six or seven greens to make sure i stayed in the tournament and got there and won

5998063 the cwa has provided a new lease on life i am doing a job with which im familiar for im a master machinist
5998064 i feel as if i was living again instead of merely existing
5998065 landing a job and getting a paycheck again makes all the difference in the world
5998066 the main thing is budgeting for a family of five on cwa pay this work is something any healthy man can do and it certainly beat sitting around the house and running out of conversation
5998067 one of the last pieces of property to which i clung when i lost my business early in the depression was that lot over there
5998068 i paid 5 000 for it we used to drive up here and i had planned some day to build a home in keeping with those of the neighborhood the place where im working now was just a dumping place but look how it is being improved and i am having a part in it
5998069 before the depression local families in need never exceeded 20 to 25
5998070 at the present time were taking care of nearly 300 families many of whom are dependent upon charity for the bare necessities for the first time in their lives
5998071 one of the key skin treatments in looking after eczema and ichthyosis is to use emollients as often as possible they are the foundation on which all additional treatment is based however the most important consideration is whether the patient finds the emollient recommended by their physician acceptable to use the most greasy that is tolerated should be used and this may vary during the day so that a lighter cream may be more appropriate for daytime use and a greasier one at night sticky messy or difficult to apply emollients will simply not be used as often as they should be so the patients skin condition can easily get out of control
5998072 ichthyosis varies enormously across and within the different types it is therefore very important for sufferers to have a choice of emollients which are appropriate to the severity of their condition
5998073 the combination of glycerol which improves the stratum corneum elasticity and white soft paraffin and liquid paraffin in dexeryl offers a highly acceptable non sticky and non greasy formulation which patients in our trials significantly prefer

5998080 the chicks are using this new show at slide as an opportunity to create brand new material including some foot juggling satanic showdowns with telstra and hot new outfits
5998081 each chick never ceases to amaze me in their sense of the absurd
5998082 hatched on planet queer seen in their irreverence their wit and spectacular enjoyment of political incorrectness they are not backward at coming forward

5998084 its totally frustrating especially after flogging yourself for eight weeks in pre season and then just when you start to look forward to the games this happens
5998085 things were going really well i played out in bayonne in a friendly the week before felt in great shape and was looking forward to getting on the field against western force
5998086 if you do lsd sometime in the future when you least expect it you will have serious debilitating flashbacks
5998087 i needed to go down to the basement and just sit
5998088 families arent aware of it or they have misconceptions that it wont be good for the patient or that the patient wont want to go or the staff wont be able to handle their mother or somehow it isnt right to leave her
5998089 they often dont have the opportunity to explore these ideas
5998090 im a good daughter i can take care of her myself
5998091 i looked at my husband and i felt sorry for him i knew he needed a break and i realized that i did too much as i love my mother im married and we need to take care of each other
5998092 what kind of daughter am i leaving her for four days
5998093 i felt i was being selfish why do i need this time away from her
5998094 she used to do a word puzzle all the time
5998095 she refused to do it at home but she was doing it wonderfully there once she came home it was no to everything she went right back down they told me that was normal the primary caregiver gets the least cooperation
5998096 we also act as advocates for the person in the medical system
5998097 i could tell the entire time that she had not been bathed
5998098 we could hear her screaming as we were walking down the hall it was awful
5998099 get on the phone and say when are you going to get me
5998100 at that point im already relaxed but when it happens at the front end it takes a minute for me to readjust
5998101 one family set up a message hi mom were having a good time
5998102 ive witnessed clients say on the phone how could you do this to me i hate it here and the daughter feels guilty and yet mom is having a great time at the bingo game
5998103 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
5998104 we try to give him as normal a life as we can
5998105 we in the us have to recognise that and its not just the us japan the uk and western europe have the same challenges going forward
5998106 its just wicked to show that in windsurfing were still one of the best sailing disciplines toms had some great role models to follow starting with bruce and now hes made it in his own space
5998107 its all been up to him you cant claim anything its all been him
5998108 hes stayed calm he stayed on the plan in his programme and hasnt altered any of those things
5998109 hes a very determined young guy that knows exactly what he wants and how hes going to get it and hes never failed in doing that never doubted his ability in being able to win
5998110 hes had meticulous training hes young so hes fit and strong and you have to be a bit psycho to be the best and he is so its perfect
5998111 we would prefer coupled relationship because it is equal and applies to both heterosexual couples whether married or de facto and same sex couples
5998112 but because of the importance of the other issues involved this is not a sticking point
5998113 this will not affect substantively the rights of same sex couples whether or not theyre called married and de facto couples still means theyre substantively equal it is less important than if they were lumped in with interdependency

5998118 this adverse event appears to be clinically relevant to consider only in patients with elevated cardiovascular risk
5998119 the results of studies indicating increased risks of heart disease have been unexpected because gsk has always looked into our database and never revealed any increased risks
5998120 obviously we take any potential safety issues very seriously and were working with various groups to understand what this means at this stage though our position is that the data is inconclusive
5998121 the abacavir findings are of concern but they are also not clear cut and further follow up trials will be needed
5998122 why is there such a disconnect between the state of political journalism and anything that anyone actually cares too much about in the rudd era
5998123 rudd himself usually avoids sharpening the edges of any political knives leaving the liberals hoist on their own petard
5998124 kogarah is not exactly the most progressive area in sydney it certainly isnt like marrickville or the city of sydney in terms of demography but we are happy to show a bit of leadership and remove discrimination against our residents and employees where we can
5998125 our people deserve to be respected and have their relationships respected and that is what we are doing
5998126 what is the best invention of the last thirty years
5998127 we have to do what we can to prolong the time we can maintain decent homes standards this is the only option open to us but what happens after 2013 nobody knows
5998128 it is a problem for the government and we cant keep selling council houses to raise money forever
5998129 also all microsoft has to do is stop releasing updates or security patches and xp users will have to move to mac or linux downgrade to vista
5998130 the crossings will be closed today and tomorrow the situation will be reassessed the crossings may be reopened tomorrow depending on the situation
5998131 as to when ill be back on the practice field thats still to be determined
5998132 there were large numbers of police in the area on friday and saturday night which is a good thing but were still concerned
5998133 the court judgment is vindication of the citys commitment to balancing the needs of residents and the night time economy of our city
5998134 it reaffirms that late trading hours are a privilege for those premises that have shown ongoing good management practices and not a right
5998135 until the management of this hotel show an ongoing level of compliance over a reasonable period of time then i would respectfully submit that the development consent trading hours are reviewed and strong consideration be made for the trading hours to be reverted to standard trading hours for hotels

5998139 in conjunction with the midnight shift and team sydney we will be holding a night of celebrations in appreciation for the unyielding support given to the sydney convicts over the past 12 months by our sponsor the glbt community and our supporters
5998140 its vital that we try to maintain and improve on our sporting community connections the convicts are one of the strongest clubs in the world and we couldnt do it without community support
5998141 a couple of the very good looking members of the band might have a certain amount of fear in them im not too sure about that ive been through a lot in my life and i totally reject that comment
5998142 im not homophobic the potbelleez arent at all about defining their sexuality who needs to define it
5998143 i dont need to define it maybe a lot of other people need to but ive had enough experiences in my life to be really happy and sorted everyone has their struggles and certainly the person that said that has a struggle going on inside them but they need to maybe write a song and get over it
5998144 mardi gras was astronomical we didnt know what to expect as with that sort of audience there is a different way of looking at it its not about getting off your tits and its not honouring anything other than a party its about letting go and embracing whats there
5998145 at live gigs we turn into animals i dissolve and dont know whats going on at a live gig we dont have too many coordinated points in the set we just let go and its like a jungle on stage and we swing from tree to tree
5998146 its going to be a great party and you can expect to dance your asses off
5998147 there will definitely be some uplifting and bulldozer tracks because we are guys that come from different backgrounds but we all identify with anthemic ideas of coming out of a dark little spell and opening up
5998148 there is a lot more depth now as music has brought us together and harnessed our energy we have come from completely different backgrounds one thing that we all identify with in the band is having a great time and having a good party
5998149 we are all here for a reason and have something to say we have taken some of these little truths in our lives and decorated them and made them really funky and picturesque
5998150 its a half day workshop that covers everything les bian couples might need to know about
5998151 we talk about self insemination known donor and non known donor insemination as well as general health issues for women who want to get pregnant we will also have a lawyer present on the day to talk about legal issues
5998152 we also bring in couples who have been through the process to speak to the women and provide answers to their questions that always proves to be incredibly popular i think the women who come along are always so happy to find an environment that addresses the birth process in a way which is specific to their needs
5998153 it was amazing to be in an inclusive environment where everyone understood and it was all focused on lesbians
5998154 wed been trying to find a service like this in sydney for a while because while a lot of the information around for hetero couples is still applicable it can be really hard for your partner who can feel excluded
5998155 i mean it really can be heartbreaking for them to be completely discounted in that process
5998156 the leichhardt womens centre is one of the few spaces left that is run on feminist principles so it has a great atmosphere to begin with even when we moved out of the inner west we decided to keep going there just because it felt so welcoming it makes a huge difference when youre pregnant to just do whatever you can to feel comfortable
5998157 twenty years ago i held a cross like that on the rings but i was 15kg lighter much much fitter and then they changed the routines
5998158 do nothing mallard has totally missed the point of my proposal
5998159 the use of the word zone may have prevented some from realising that the proposal is to develop a strategy not street signage such a strategy could incorporate a logo based campaign using posters stickers and drink coasters for businesses and badges and t shirts for individuals
5998160 or it could be more complex such as businesses declaring their premises homophobia free zones in addition to the safe place
5998161 deeply angered by clover moores partys soft approach to addressing homophobic violence
5998162 community labor will make it compulsory for pubs clubs and bars submitting council development applications to detail how they will effectively manage their venues to ensure they are homophobia free
5998163 in addition to this initiative the community labor team is committed to funding extra police for the city police who are properly trained to deal with homophobic incidents
5998164 we dont know why theyre on the list they dont know why theyre on the list the government wont tell us why theyre on the list
5998165 im really looking forward to watching the trampoline finals in beijing i want to see how good the chinese are going to be word is theyre on fire
5998166 i started trampolining way back in the mid 80s i started jumping around in the backyard until mum took me up to the local gym to keep my crazy bouncing under control
5998167 mum tells me that i always said i wanted to compete at the olympics but who knew it would be on trampoline it wasnt in the olympics back then
5998168 it was fate though i guess because at the height of my trampoline career my sport was chosen to join the gymnastic family paving the way for it to be included as a full medal sport
5998169 there is a little showgirl in us all so when they offered me a role in their new production i jumped at the chance
5998170 being involved in the sport for so many years it has been a breath of fresh air being able to express ideas and create something new with the acrobatic world
5998171 my sport is a judged event so you have to conform to what the judges are looking for but with cirque if you can make it look amazing they love you
5998172 i just love performing and that rush you get when the crowd starts responding with oohs and ahhs
5998173 weve seen people coming through in fetish that weve never seen before
5998174 obviously for us the move has mainly been about going where our demographic is and the numbers have shown us that 70 percent of our crowd comes from the inner west
5998175 obviously there are going to be people who arent happy with the move but thats fine and for us are we missing oxford st not really
5998176 so far weve seen a number of our regulars coming through and others that used to come that we havent seen in a while but you have to keep in mind that weve been able to get those numbers without advertising since we moved and during the winter months so were not too worried about how its going to go
5998177 this isnt going to be a one night a week operation it will be an all week affair
5998178 it means just as much to us to have manacle running five nights a week as it does to give space to social groups which is what this space will allow us to do
5998179 i suppose coming from where we have with 20 years of involvement with the fetish community we were just at a point where we thought there has to be more to offer than just parties
5998180 that would usually be sufficient to exchange fluid and qualify as sex
5998181 yes sir because they increase their chance of transmitting an infection such as hiv
5998182 its justifying its current gay blood ban policy using some of the grossest and most offensive myths and stereotypes around
5998183 many of the samples in studies cited by the red cross are very small recruited from men at high risk and explicitly exclude men who practise safe sex in monogamous relationships they are not representative of all men who have sex with men
5998184 when you ask australians a straightforward honest question youre likely to get a straightforward honest answer
5998185 i think were talking about a one in 100 risk of death on the one hand with using old blood and about a one in a million risk of hiv on the other much rarer than getting struck by lightning
5998186 it is people that often face prejudices in the community or find it hard to be accepted and they want to show that they are worthwhile
5998187 they want to take part and get their message across to hopefully create a better understanding of their particular situations
5998188 normally when you come in to choose something it can be quite a solitary experience so this gives a chance of some interaction we hope people will take it up
5998189 so often we can get stuck doing the same things talking to the same people and this is an opportunity to talk to someone whos had really different experiences to you and get another view of the world
5998190 we will make social media technology bend to our rules
5998191 blow up all the rule books let self organizing networks evolve
5998192 to be honest were fairly confident were playing in division two and we would be very disappointed if we didnt make the semi finals and pretty disappointed if we didnt make the finals
5998193 weve been playing together for several years now so we know how each other plays and how to work with each other
5998194 well spend the first three days of the tournament playing qualifying games and when were not doing that well be watching the other teams play and work out how we should modify the structure of our game
5998195 to be honest though were fairly confident of our structure and we have two new strikers playing with us this year and a new goalie i dont think the other teams are going to be expecting that and it should give us an advantage
5998196 its serious football and we want to win but between games we plan to have some serious fun as well
5998197 aussiebum and eagle leather have given us lanyards and australian key chains to give to our competitors so off the field were keen to make friends and have fun at some of the parties
5998198 but once were on the field it doesnt matter who youve made friends with
5998199 if people dont understand whats behind the numbers theyll think this is a good news story that worries me
5998200 it should probably be a least 30 days but there is pressure to free up the bed for someone else
5998201 hospitals and hospital administrators have traditionally discriminated against mental health conditions and people with them thats principally because of in my view the stigma attached to mental illnesses
5998202 theyre discharging people into the community without the necessary supports you would never discharge a patient with a broken back in need of a wheelchair without a wheelchair

5998208 he can talk all he wants about britney spears and paris hilton but i dont have time for that mess
5998209 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5998210 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5998211 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5998212 barack obama has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in iraq is more important to him than victory in iraq thats not a criticism of his patriotism thats a criticism of his judgment
5998213 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed

5998238 i didnt have david cameron in my head but i was pitilessly photographing for the page what is my milieus experience of country living from having the aga to owning the right boot rack i wanted to show exactly how things look the conservatives are very materialistic and they dress this up with their greenness but its just a new form of consumerism all these things are status symbols like liz hurleys gloucester old spot pigs the countryside has given people a larger canvas to display their wonderfulness
5998239 its a show off thing it allows them to say we come from the soil and of course the shires are all tory labour has done brilliantly in bringing out sleepy rural communities to a greater level of activism
5998240 im the death knell to every trend with this massive recession looming shire hell may already be an anachronism notting hill ended with a great jolt with people losing their jobs in the city its not cool to flash it about so much now ive heard people saying they wont take their chef in the yacht this summer and that they will have to cut back from four to two polo ponies thrift is the new chic
5998241 a very simple but comfortable house there are gillies and people stalking
5998242 are dear to cameron he brilliantly combines the new green and the old tories

5998297 i dont want any sex offenders in this country but the point is vietnamese officials have deported him to the uk so as we do whenever sex offenders return to this country we need to plan for what happens when people return

5998700 hay que arreglar algunos problemas jur dicos y es bastante complicado
5998701 circumstances in the novel are different but the structure of society is the same
5998702 readers nowadays see themselves in the book especially poor young people see their own lives described there
5998703 day temp staff workers are being discarded like disposable articles
5998704 the ou initiative is the only major us initiative of its kind devoted to the problem of biodeterioration and biocorrosion
5998705 first we have to understand how mother nature cleans up these spills and we can do this by studying the way microorganisms interact with hydrocarbons
5998706 we want to better understand how organisms eat through these pipelines several fundamental mechanisms cause this problem but it is spotty and doesnt occur all of a sudden
5998707 rather biocorrosion occurs over a long period of time and we are using a series of new molecular and chemical tools to find out why and how this happens
5998708 we think cells grow in communities that adhere to the inner surface of pipelines and form three dimensional biofilms that can sometimes cause pitting once we understand what these microorganisms are doing we can interrupt their processes or diagnose them more effectively
5998709 because two thirds of us oil is still in place we can use these organisms to convert residual hydrocarbons into natural gas and create a new source of domestic energy
5998710 its also about making the way they behave to be suitable for a western environment its not just language its also what they say and how they say it
5998711 spc means finding slopes from the way the surface looks under different illuminations and once we know the slopes we can find the heights
5998712 we suspect that these residuals errors are primarily due to incorrect spacecraft position
5998713 in other words the orbits are not exactly correct we intend to solve for those orbits and then the new orbital data can be used to more accurately determine the bodys gravitational field
5998714 we dont have the processes in space to remove excess heat or keep the spacecraft warm in excess cold
5998715 it may sound very trivial but controlling the temperature of a spacecraft is absolutely crucial
5998716 trading in the first half has been disappointing as a result of difficult conditions in the economy in general turnover was down on the second half of 2007 figure in that period 104m this reflects a slowing in the level of enquiries and conversion of these into firm orders along with a number of projects being deferred or cancelled
5998717 this throws into doubt the viability of the entire roads programme and is the last thing contractors want with the economic downturn continuing to bite deep into the heart of the industry
5998718 there have been downturns before but the roads programme was not seriously hit this time though it is shrinking
5998719 yet another way of delaying a decision as long as possible by passing the scheme through yet another level of bureaucracy
5998720 theyre reneging on eci they dont think its value for money and now want to get contractors involved later rather than earlier
5998721 no planning application has gone in at the moment and we are still in negotiations with hab about the scheme
5998722 over the next few months we will be looking at ways we maximise bang for our buck
5998723 none of them along the line know what any of it is worth
5998724 there must be some way out of here said the joker to the thief

5998759 the disposal of human wastes is a subject normally buried in euphemism and avoidance at least in public privately every single person on the planet is intimately concerned on a day to day even hour to hour basis with the need to relieve themselves in a congenial place and fashion the physiological necessity of excretion cannot be averted even if it cannot be spoken of no one can attain the purity of the perfect saint who manages to digest every single thing he or she consumes a power that certain holy men in the ancient world were believed to possess even the most rigid toilet training can enable a person to postpone their visits to the rest room only for a certain length of time every day each human being emits an average of slightly less than 100 grams of feces and roughly one and a half litres of urine even though this regular process of bodily evacuation may not be thought of as dishonourable and base a phrase from victorian england it is nonetheless regarded as noxious and unmentionable by most of the human race this is an unspoken subject in almost every culture except in the context of ribaldry and scatological humour the organs of defecation are close to or identified with those used for sex another delicate subject the subspecies of engineers who preoccupy themselves with mire are viewed askance as if they were mildly touched and in the uk plumbers earn more than other kinds of household fixers because of bravery in the face of ordure the very word toilet at least upon the anglo saxon tongue has an awkward and embarrassed ring and its use is often regarded as vulgar that there is a worldwide sanitary crisis is indisputable over 40 per cent of people in the developing world still depend on a bucket a bush the banks of a stream a backstreet or some other sheltered place for their several daily emissions

5998761 are the males of this species addicted to kinky sexual practices such as drinking girls piss if so they should just go to a prostitute or broach the subject of piss drinking with their wives its a bad mistake on their part because for one thing the female hormones from the contraceptive pill are being excreted in girls piss into the water supply via the flush toilet then the men are drinking recycled girls piss when they turn on the tap and the female hormones in the water supply are making the men of this species infertile and making them grow breasts

5998790 it alluded to a big announcement that would tie ubuntu to a new netbook and this looks like the news weve been waiting for
5998791 the interesting part is that the version of ubuntu bundled with the dell machine is likely to be the new netbook remix edition
5998792 this is a version of ubuntu optimised for the atom processor and features a new big button interface much like the kind those found on the eeepc and aspire one

5998823 when people say mr tobacco farmer go do something else or grow something else in fairness they really dont understand you just cant get out of debt that easily we need help
5998824 its difficult to have worked your whole lifetime and to watch this thing unfold the way it has
5998825 people cannot pay off debt and continue to grow something different you have creditors you have financial institutions from which youve borrowed money these debts have to be paid back
5998826 we know there are many people that are welcoming an exit and need to take an exit and want to take an exit there will be a lot of farmers i anticipate taking that
5998827 were just growing it because what else are we going to do

5998835 you media guys can get negative about quite a bit of stuff but this is the preseason
5998836 in some areas weve done well in some areas we have struggled but all and all as a unit i think were getting better and i think were really going to show that in the next few weeks
5998837 as an offense we need to be hoping we get pressure thats a chance to make big plays and really let our playmakers go to work i wouldnt take any other offensive line the guys we have around us are going to play at a very high level
5998838 when were playing fast when were playing confident and were doing the right things we will be a good offense
5998839 we take a lot of things into consideration but in the end it comes down to a gut feeling you have
5998840 i hope to get good results in the last six races of 2008 and after that i am moving to another team i will ride for kawasaki next year so its a big change for me

5998850 locarno has an excellent reputation in the tourist and cultural fields
5998851 and we are proud that a swiss airbus a320 will now carry its name to all of europes major airports
5998852 with its piazza grande and lake maggiore locarno offers the perfect setting for one of the worlds most important film festivals
5998853 good transport links are vital to our being able to stage such an event and a good number of our guests from all over the world come to switzerland by air from now on they may even get here on the locarno
5998854 we are the national airline of the whole of switzerland
5998855 and as our countrys ambassador we are proud to represent locarno and canton ticino this wonderful region in switzerlands south
5998856 come and knock on our doooor come and knock on our door
5998857 it is a good project in the name of brotherly relations
5998858 we hadden net een nieuw softwareprogramma dat niet goed werkte gevolg was dat we 250 winkels niet goed konden bevoorraden in de belangrijkste periode van het jaar we zaten met volle magazijnen lege winkels en boze klanten dat was heel lullig op z n rotterdams gezegd
5998859 toen we probeerden de problemen te verhelpen sliepen we met z n allen op kantoor we zijn overgestapt op handmatige verzending de pizzaboeren in de omgeving draaiden in die periode hele goede omzet
5998860 het heeft ons in totaal 7 a 8 miljoen euro gekost
5998861 als ik alleen maar zou verdedigen heb ik tegen zulke goede speelsters geen kans
5998862 ik kan ook wel aardig aanvallen maar tot nu toe deed ik dat niet vaak in wedstrijden nu durfde ik dat wel
5998863 g l was tried in the same case as erbakan it is as if he pardoned himself
5998864 whatever its race language or religion the pain suffered by anyone in the region makes us sad
5998865 the pain has to stop and everyone has to spend an effort for this
5998866 black or white muslim or christian it doesnt even matter one single life is important you cannot expect the whole world to remain indifferent to what happens in africa
5998867 we attach a major significance to this candidacy as we have not served on the security council since 1961
5998868 we are pleased that the great majority of our african friends have already pledged their support for our candidature
5998869 if elected to the security council turkey will pay special attention to the priorities and problems of african countries
5998870 the government has taken significant steps to further intensify and deepen our relations with africa
5998871 during my visit to ethiopia i marked the opening of the regional office of tika the turkish international cooperation and development agency
5998872 this office has since been followed by regional offices in sudan and senegal
5998873 in march 2008 we allocated a further 50 million for african countries to be utilized over the next five years
5998874 we have also encouraged our businessmen to do business with african countries
5998875 the target before us is now 30 billion by 2010
5998876 the importance of turkish african cooperation is seen with threats like the food crises and epidemics that gravely affect africa and that we observe with great concern
5998877 african nations are unfortunately also the victims of global climate change towards this we need to cooperate on such fields as climate change and environment desertification wetlands biological diversity and wildlife preservation
5998878 to share our experiences and technology as best we can with african nations
5998879 because most tourists in turkey prefer coastal towns the abundance of domestic chains and groups in the turkish accommodation sector provides a big advantage for the sector
5998880 to overcome the existing problems between the turks and the armenians close contacts are needed
5998881 nowadays people have to fly to georgia and once they arrive there hire a car travel for hours and finally arrive in yerevan and some will even fly to yerevan via europe
5998882 therefore it is urgent that flight ticket prices to armenia should become cheaper and that more private turkish airline companies should operate flights to armenia
5998883 turks have developed an interest in armenia in recent years and want to visit that country but because of high flight ticket prices they turn to alternative ways to travel
5998884 it was the first time that armenians of istanbul met people of armenia
5998885 thousands of diaspora members were also there it was highly interesting that both the non turk diaspora members and the armenians of armenia were a little frosty to the armenians from istanbul
5998886 if you make an agreement today it might be rescinded tomorrow
5998887 sunday was a huge a blow for valeri and for the team as well not least because of the previous injury worries he has had both before coming to city and since
5998888 he had done well to come back from the knee surgery and had won his place in the side on merit it was a terrible blow
5998889 it is a big ask for him now to come back again after working so exceptionally hard after such a long period of time to return from knee damage but if anyone is equipped to do so it is valeri
5998890 his personality and his demeanour will help him he is a naturally buoyant character and he will need all of that positive energy because it is going to be a long road of hard work ahead of him
5998891 his reaction in the aftermath of the injury was very positive and he quickly started to get things organised for his rehab to begin as soon as possible he was straight on to the medical staff to sort out timescales and that is the sort of upbeat attitude he will need
5998892 my injuries were the same but five years apart so things are a little different but i know exactly how he is feeling and the great thing for valeri is that age is on his side
5998893 in some respects he has to embrace the situation he is in and become a little bit selfish
5998894 we have planned the places for industry agriculture and tourism for the next 25 years and our plans have been approved by the relevant organizations
5998895 the constitutional courts decision proved that the akp is a focal point for anti secular activities the akp holds the parliamentary majority consenting to their demands of constitutional change is trusting the sheep to wolf
5998896 we know what will follow next they will make the parliament elect constitutional court members and will call it a law reform
5998897 after all these allegations we can not force him to declare his property di li should be ashamed of himself
5998898 erdo an should follow his regulations claims on di lis deal are more than rumors k l daro lu documented a deal with di lis own signature akp argues that it attacks corruption wherever it leads it leads to your own deputy
5998899 we will discuss the project with armenia to construct a cooperation region with five countries
5998900 we decided to improve the display so that visitors spend more time to learn about the horror of the bombing
5998901 to me and to many of the survivors this museum has become way too clean and pretty and not shocking
5998902 when this museum was opened in 1955 it was much more shocking and it has been gradually cleaned up and made more like a professional museum
5998903 when you go through here you should be shocked you should be frightened
5998904 as i get older i feel more strongly that we have to hand down our experiences to the next generation the message that war is horrible
5998905 on the day of the bombing my father immediately went to the center of the city to save and search for people but he didnt say a word about it before he died in 1988
5998906 they were trudging toward us some putting bandages on some using crutches some stopped walking and fell down they were like ghosts it was a cruel scene that i will never be able to forget my whole life
5998907 i was too scared to talk about it but that scene keeps haunting me throughout my life
5998908 but mr nakamaes photos have remarkably clear images which is rare for those taken and offered by ordinary people
5998909 the state department is working at the necessary agreements to achieve some passage in the straits of turkey and things like that
5998910 turkey is our nato ally and as a friend of georgia in my view should have been more supportive of their georgian neighbors and of their american allies
5998911 and this brings back the bad taste of turkey for example barring american troops from going into iraq through turkish ports and turkish territory in 2003 a step that vastly damaged the turkish american relations id hoped we were putting that behind us
5998912 georgia stands at a strategic crossroads in the caucasus the baku tbilisi ceyhan pipeline which brings oil from the caspian to points west traverses georgia and if that pipeline were to be destroyed or controlled by russia global energy supplies would be even more vulnerable to russian influence with serious consequences on the world energy market
5998913 while the sudanese leader is facing serious charges at an international court the political support the authoritarian leader receives in turkey is something that he does not deserve
5998914 why is turkey running away from being a party to an international convention this is rather controversial
5998915 this drags turkey into the front of wrong countries and impairs its image abroad
5998916 this really upset us the state launches the training program gives them a salary and guarantees a job but no ones interested
5998917 kind of dark and moody like the work ive been involved in
5998918 cbs asked us whos at the top of your dream list
5998919 without hesitation we said laurence fishburne he is a powerful and intense actor with an incredible range
5998920 what makes shows go off the rails is they forget who they are were a crime mystery forensics drama and that wont change
5998921 now that we have produced it we are indebted to share
5998922 all that we expect from you is that you share it with your loved ones without measuring it with money without expecting anything in return
5998923 go away from the middle from the east go back home there is rebellion in the house and blood here
5998924 that song was written by the time the united states started the war in iraq
5998925 if there is a war going on you have to tell about it you are telling about life and life goes on like that there is poverty on the streets love on the streets and war
5998926 i wish there was a proposal it would have been good to have one but there is no such thing i have not been preparing anything if i had a proposal why would i deny it it is not an infamous crime
5998927 the hadrianus gate really deserves the title of the most beautiful gate of pamphylia with all its grandeur
5998928 having the tablet dating back to roman times and the two turrets on both sides of the gate the monument exhibits the distinctive architectural style of ancient times
5998929 rather than being stuck inside a giant hotel complex we opted to make the best use of our time by driving around and seeing the hot spots in turkey which is rich in historical and cultural values
5998930 the hadrianus gate is really worth seeing as it is a monument from the ancient times standing at the heart of the city
5998931 this is my first time in antalya but i am really stunned by the different aura of the city
5998932 antalya is surrounded with many historical places exhibiting the values styles and structures of the various civilizations and eras they are worth seeing indeed
5998933 i was told about the hadrianus gate by my turkish friends who strongly advised me to see the monument during my stay in antalya
5998934 it stands here at the middle of the city representing the two civilizations and challenging time it is a privilege to see this greatness
5998935 the ship has a 19 person capacity and if there are not any tests such an accident may occur when the ship is on the sea then all 19 passengers on the ship would die
5998936 they were like my sons we were eating together when i visit the shipyard i cried for days after the accident
5998937 unskilled workers work in the shipyards i watched on tv that workers stand underneath a man who welds the irons it is like they do this on purpose
5998938 there is something not suiting the construction project of the vessel at the point where the lifeboat fell off the vessel into the sea the lifeboat has touched to that point which should not happen
5998939 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5998940 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
5998941 help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors
5998942 this is a well grounded program that takes into account turkeys realities
5998943 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5998944 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5998945 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction
5998946 due to the still solid economic growth the broadly based demand for commercial properties is likely to continue in the near future the company said in the statement
5998947 we are likely to see attractively priced acquisition opportunities outside the urban and economic centers in the coming years
5998948 the avid interest in commercial areas was particularly pronounced in the urban economic centers
5998949 the commercial property market has become more challenging in response to the credit crunch and slowing economies wheeler said in the statement
5998950 zimbabwes annual rate of inflation surged in june to 11 2 million percent
5998951 it gained 9 035 045 5 percentage points from the may rate of 2 233 713 4 percent
5998952 hilton dalaman golf resort amp spa is a wonderful agreement we are pleased to realize our first resort hotel investment in turkey
5998953 our company plans to increase our investments three fold in this strategic market within five years and this investment is extremely exciting for our company in this respect
5998954 the country will invite bids in late september or early october for six areas in southwestern turkey where geothermal power generation could reach a total of 800 million kilowatt hours a year
5998955 those who would like to invest in building plots have showed an immense interest to the region the values of the lands in the area will soon boost particularly following the completion of ring roads and the initiation of new housing projects
5998956 investors are willing to purchase the lands with the existing prices the lands are sold immediately after they are put up for sale
5998957 most managers become managers because they have mastered the hard skills needed for a specific job unfortunately most havent mastered the soft skills of interpersonal relations
5998958 chaay with band makhaan is much more adorable than the cappachino in mcd the so called bhandaara plalce for middel age working group
5998959 cest vrai que jai demand au cnosf de macheter une plaque et une casserole mais tout est crit en chinois jai mis quelque chose feu doux et je suis partie une heure le temps que a cuise mais jai appuy sur un bouton et la temp rature a augment plus vite que pr vu il y a eu de la fum e et les pompiers ont d venir jai dabord cru une blague mais quand je suis rentr e a sentait le br l ca a br l vraiment au fond car la casserole tait en inox et jen ai t quitte pour mexcuser aupr s du cnosf
5998960 all turkish firms interested in operating in africa should start regional feasibility studies immediately
5998961 by organizing the turkey africa private sector program we aim to help integrate the african economy into the world economy
5998962 we aim to spread turkeys organized industrial zone culture in african countries
5998963 the operations should be launched in order to establish the turkey africa chamber of commerce immediately and render the business relations permanent
5998964 also implementing turkeys advanced agricultural techniques in africa may play an important role in overcoming famine on the continent
5998965 our long term vision is to enhance cooperation with africa in the sectors of finance industry agriculture tourism and energy
5998966 our chief target is to establish partnerships with african countries for mutual benefit
5998967 the value of the projects undertaken by turkish contractors in africa reached 22 billion last year
5998968 turkey supports the economic integration process between the mediterranean union north africa and the european union
5998969 furthermore developed countries should give up their protective policies on food products africas potential for food production should be utilized more fairly
5998970 the improvement signals that fear about an economic downturn among financial market experts is contained the recent fall in the price of oil and the weakening of the euro against the dollar must have dampened concerns about the economy
5998971 market experts have not been particularly taken aback by the negative growth rate of the second quarter they expect weaker but all in all solid economic conditions and do not fear a recession
5998972 the rise did not offset last months fall and the still deeply negative level means that many more investors expect the economy to deteriorate in the next six months than think that it will improve
5998973 a few of our destinations have been hit by natural disasters this year and that meant we have had to adjust down our capacity expansion plans and reduce flight frequency
5998974 but as of now we are still seeing very strong demand for travel within asia and we expect travel to grow
5998975 it would be easy to give in and let inflation get out of control thats what happened in the 1970s
5998976 but if everyone does it prices will just go up again and well all be back to square one but with inflation still high
5998977 ahmadinejad is making the mistake of his life by applying the delay tactic
5998978 in both issues ahmadinejad has never understood the united states and this will cost him a lot
5998979 after going through charley this doesnt seem nothing more than a gust of wind
5998980 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5998981 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5998982 we just want to make sure its not a problem
5998983 the top increase will take place in the middle east and asia pacific region therefore the issue bore special importance during negotiations with the russian federation uzbekistan and iraq
5998984 during the night iraqi forces from baghdad burst into the provincial council building
5998985 they were hitting everyone they disarmed the guards and killed my secretary abbas al tamimi
5998986 the operation involving the diyala governance centre was done without the knowledge or assistance of coalition forces
5998987 an air weapons team was in the vicinity of the incident but did not engage any targets
5998988 but i have to say its not an example of putting country first when you say president george bushs economic policies have shown great progress
5998989 mr mccain let me explain to you the economic disaster is happening right now maybe you havent noticed
5998990 in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5998991 it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
5998992 there is no deal with the president and he had himself resigned
5998993 the coalition will now have to apply themselves because they will have no excuse
5998994 the problems and challenges the country faces are enormous and they cannot afford to lose any further time
5998995 i wish president musharraf all the best we have had difficult days together but also we had good days together all in all we had a good relationship
5998996 the most important thing is not personalities what is important is that we change our expectations and the way we formulate policies to meet those expectations
5998997 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5998998 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5998999 this is one of the first columns to leave georgia
5999000 it is a show aimed at creating the illusion of a withdrawal
5999001 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5999002 we call on russia to demonstrate both in word and deed its continued commitment to the principles upon which we agreed to base our relationship
5999003 the future of our relations with russia will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to abide by the words of president dmitry medvedev which is not happening at the moment
5999004 depends on the policy of georgian president mikheil saakashvili and the action of his forces
5999005 we have the green light from 55 member states of osce but we are waiting for the green light from tbilisi
5999006 yes i can confirm that the president passed on this morning
5999007 is dictated by the necessity to preserve the stability of the country
5999008 thirteen bodies that the enemy left behind have been recovered but their casualties are much higher
5999009 posturing to attack the base and engaged them with small arms fire
5999010 six blew themselves up six others died in the explosions and one died in gunfire from commandos their bodies have been recovered
5999011 hun oppf rer seg ikke som om hun snakket med mennesker
5999012 weve had a lot of key personnel here for quite some time
5999013 its definitely helped us with service standards from day one
5999014 it is very important to us to get izmir on the map and on the convention and association calendar
5999015 i have been living here for 12 years and i am happy but different people feel different things people complaining about something in fact do not know what they want we have been adopted and have got used to they should also get used to it you get used to it after living in turkey for a while
5999016 the hardest problem is buying real estate a consulate cannot do anything to help a foreigner having problems with a real estate agent or the owner of the house this is not a problem for the british government but a problem for turkey they should find a solution another problem is about education children of the expatriates are facing difficulties as they dont know turkish another serious problem rather than access and water is the funeral issue generally we are adopting the custom of burning the dead bodies and having the ashes dispersed this is not the way in turkey but we should accept it if we have chosen to live here
5999017 there are about 10 000 foreigners in our district the british constitute the largest part of this this is the district in turkey with the largest share of foreigners and british people in particular as they equally benefit from the services we present to our citizens foreigners do not need to feel different
5999018 didim has already completed its infrastructure works and is continuing its superstructure works
5999019 looking at the average age of the settlers didim is on the way to being a city with an old age population adaptations of the streets are underway to make it easier for elderly people to walk around we also have a modern nursing home project for elderly people which is nearly finished
5999020 places like a theater and a cinema will be constituted for elder people to pass the time our parks are being organized with the same logic for foreigners we have separated a special place in the cemetery we took their demands about the church and sent them to ankara after completing the necessary documents
5999021 a lot of innocent people died i dont deserve to live
5999022 ive known alex has been available for loan for a little while
5999023 hes not fitting into their future plans and hes the type of bowler you need at the oval someone tall who hits the wicked hard
5999024 it didnt take too much thinking about to enter into the loan deal
5999025 but why is this man president bush talking about democracy only when at stake are his choice of men while he sees no harm in allying with kings and tyrants
5999026 i guess they either dont like the way i look or my intonation
5999027 my voice is low and maybe this gives the impression that i dont have self confidence
5999028 i couldnt go to school for five months with the help of my teachers i started studying at home i couldnt study as well as i wanted but i didnt give up
5999029 everybody told me not to worry and that i should try next year but i didnt give up i sat the exam with plaster on my legs using crutches
5999030 studying medicine was my dream and zmir medical faculty was my second choice i am glad i made it
5999031 fires do not start without a cause there should be a reason

5999033 our u 19 team played a tournament in armenia in may and now the u 21 team is heading there
5999034 football is a global game you should go anywhere to play so we will go to armenia to play
5999035 just because our relations with armenia are not good it is not right to talk about other things before a football game
5999036 the tension may be high but at the end we are going there to play ball
5999037 it is now ahead of brazil in the qualifying group which is something for us

5999042 the whole chinese program has gone from nothing to gold medals in four years
5999043 i expect them to be hanging tough with the brazilians and the americans
5999044 theres a lot of pressure on zou to win because all his opponents know hes the world champion so theyve already studied him
5999045 the thing i really am pleased with is she was a little under the weather and she still was able to do a wonderful routine
5999046 when i think multiple medals i think about rower steve redgrave and swimmer michael phelps although i havent quite matched up to their medals its a great achievement to have three gold medals around my neck
5999047 i feel good i hope liu has a swift recovery as hes a great athlete but his injury gives us all a chance

5999051 the district council are doing their best to identify the source and have sent people out to try to hear the hum she added
5999052 i was speaking to a dog walker who brought it to my attention and asked what it was
5999053 we have all got theories behind it some out of this world and some are logic but no one really knows what it is
5999054 ive only had a couple of people say boo back to me
5999055 it still hurts a little that he used the word front runners book said had evolved into what he said was a sincere attempt to get fans at the ballpark to be more positive
5999056 you had some cheers you had some boos i guess
5999057 thats what i said it was pretty much going to be again like i said if we get the win theyll be cheering
5999058 i was speaking for a lot of guys i wasnt just speaking for ryan ryans had his share ive had my share pat burrell has had his share i think chase utley hasnt been touched and hopefully it remains that way
5999059 a lot of times and ive actually heard it they dont want to put their family and kids in a situation where they come to the field and these are the types of things their kids are going to have to sit through and listen to thats just the truth those arent my words those are words that ive actually heard
5999060 but it could have been worse in my opinion i saw people standing up for j roll i heard some claps even though its pretty hard to hear way up here
5999061 im glad i did it im still hoping it catches on some more i mean who knows

5999064 a day will make it easier for people to engage with pensions
5999065 too much of the time we have to tell people what they cant do in future people will be free to do far more with pensions
5999066 the pension savings and state benefits of the average family still fall well short of the recommended income replacement rate of 66 100 being working life income
5999067 it seems the uk working population also has unrealistic expectations of when they want to retire the desired age currently stands at 62
5999068 liu is definitely the most shining star more than any other chinese athlete in the games
5999069 what if liu xiang fails to get the gold at the beijing olympics
5999070 as pursuing gold medals is just too important an issue
5999071 the sports field is like a battlefield liu xiang should have never yielded
5999072 we used to flatter him as a god but he fooled us
5999073 you have to reach the finish line even if you have to crawl others can withdraw but you cant because youre liu xiang
5999074 he couldnt withdraw in advance otherwise the importance of the beijing olympics would drop at least 30 percent

5999077 hundreds of companies are going to do this its going to become a very common feature over the next six months
5999078 a company may have been taken over or the pension scheme been merged in the past with a promise to members of no change to the pension scheme
5999079 later the employer says they want to cut back on benefits for future service and someone digs up the old promise
5999080 some rules have entrenched provisions which prevent changes for the future
5999081 we have always supported the idea of consultation but employers need the power to redesign schemes in line with the companys financial position
5999082 some consultations are a sham some arent a lot think consultation is just telling
5999083 we dont have powers preventing employers making changes for future provision
5999084 changes are in practice being made and agreed in quite a few companies where the dynamics of the business and the risk have been explained
5999085 an asymmetry between a state pension age quite rightly rising now to 68 by 2045 while someone who joined the civil service before 2005 even if currently aged only 25 will retire at age 60
5999086 the disparity between public and private sector workers is unsustainable and will threaten the durability of the proposals in this bill
5999087 we are making substantial changes to public service schemes to secure their long term sustainability the reforms will achieve the savings that were originally projected
5999088 a major step forward towards a more generous and less means tested state pension system
5999089 most ambitious reform of the pensions system in modern times
5999090 even if they had said years later your pension will be a few pounds more i couldnt have done it because we needed the money to live on
5999091 i didnt want to do it you feel kind of ashamed that you are having to do it telling people all about your personal financial income
5999092 i rang the free phone number and it was an awful thing to go through talking about your personal finances horrible you are exposing yourself the whole process was intrusive
5999093 at first it got me 11 a week which probably sounds like nothing but when you are on a low income it makes a big difference and now its 16 a week and i dont have to pay the full council rent and council tax
5999094 theres a look of resignation on their faces maybe some go away and do it but theres a lot who arent
5999095 if we had a reasonable state pension that allowed us to do the things we wanted to do we wouldnt have to go through those hoops they should do away with means testing id rather have a decent state pension so i could pay my own way
5999096 i wouldnt be at all surprised if we were a 10bn fund inside five years that is merely a reflection on the rate of insolvencies and the question of how much of a deficit is crystallised on the insolvency of an employer
5999097 the reason deficits have increased has generally been through macro economic and demographic factors the largest is that we are actually living longer
5999098 business has been doing a good job of recognising the increase in deficits and putting extra contributions in something between 17bn and 20bn in extra deficit contributions
5999099 we have been busily monitoring the solvency of companies and pension schemes gathering data from scheme returns
5999100 in the last few years in the uk deficits have gone up quite a lot we discovered that the amount of risk out there in the system was much much higher than people had really appreciated
5999101 we are rather like a messenger charged by the government to go out and measure the amount of risk and come back to tell people how much risk is out there
5999102 we took the view that we wouldnt pre fund for those things because the contingency is remote but if it happens we will face up to it then
5999103 what we need to monitor is how many of the larger schemes are in distress and how far in advance we can discover this
5999104 all of the big failures that occurred in the us you could actually spot about 3 years in advance as the business slid down the credit ratings
5999105 no i dont think it would the key thing is whats the deficit very rarely if ever will there be a cash flow problem for a pension fund so you do have time to build up the extra reserves
5999106 what we would like to do is make a lot of that information available to the public as a public service there are many people in the pensions industry who would be very interested to see exactly what the shape of the risk is
5999107 in a capitalist system of competitive businesses insolvencies are going to occur some companies are going to succeed some will go down
5999108 it was pretty obvious to me that a company so small would not be able to make that payment
5999109 in fact if the company had not called in the administrators the trustees would have done as we could see the company couldnt make the payments
5999110 im very hopeful we can sell the business as a going concern we need another month at it before we can conclude
5999111 the company has a lot of new business coming in it is starting to grow and we are thinking of taking on more staff in 2007
5999112 we will identify all scheme members there will be a lot of data cleaning we will also make sure there has been no fraudulent activity

5999124 den metallarbeitgeberverb nden geht es nicht darum langfristig in die kinderbetreuung einzusteigen
5999125 es bleibt aufgabe des staates ein bedarfsgerechtes angebot an betreuungspl tzen sicherzustellen dennoch suchen schon heute viele betriebe nach wegen ihre mitarbeiter dort zu unterst tzen wo staatliche angebote fehlen mit sommerkinder wollen wir zeigen wie dies praktisch geht und hoffen dass unser modell wellen schl gt der staat wiederum muss die entsprechenden rahmenbedingungen schaffen damit betriebliche initiativen nicht ausgebremst werden

5999152 die partnerschaft mit sevenload erm glicht uns innovative wege in der vermarktung unserer programmmarken zu gehen eines unserer zentralen anliegen dabei ist dass content und plattform zueinander passen das ist bei dieser kooperation optimal gelungen

5999154 sevenload hat sich den anspruch gesetzt den zuschauer zu unterhalten und intensiv in das programmbegleitende social media network zu integrieren die kooperation mit grundy ufa zeigt dass die verbreitung ber neue vertriebswege f r produktionsfirmen einen hohen stellenwert besitzt wer sich heute dagegen wehrt wird auf dauer keinen zugang zur jungen internetaffinen generation finden
5999155 unser ungebrochen dynamisch verlaufendes neugesch ft und der im vergleich zu anderen instituten hohe anteil der kundenforderungen an der bilanzsumme von knapp 50 dokumentieren die enge verkn pfung der helaba mit der realwirtschaft und verdeutlichen das zukunftspotential einer integrierten universalbank der konzernweite ausgewogene mix aus retail und wholesale gesch ft bildet die stabile basis f r unsere operative ertragsst rke und hat sich auch in der finanzmarktkrise sehr bew hrt
5999156 aufgrund der zur ckhaltung zahlreicher banken im kundengesch ft konnten wir erfreulicherweise unsere marktchancen nutzen dabei haben wir im neugesch ft keinerlei abstriche an unserem konservativen risikoprofil und der fristenkongruenten refinanzierung vorgenommen
5999157 auch in schwierigen m rkten konnte die helaba ihr hervorragendes marktstanding bei den privaten und institutionellen investoren nutzen dabei haben wir von unserem guten rating und der performance der helaba in der finanzmarktkrise profitiert
5999158 angesichts der bonit tsm ssig unver ndert hohen qualit t des wertpapierbestandes des helaba konzerns stellen diese bewertungsbelastungen weitgehend wirtschaftliche reserven dar die bei f lligkeit in den n chsten jahren ertragswirksam anfallen wir sehen deshalb keinerlei notwendigkeit zu vorzeitigen bestandsver u erungen im handelsbuch und bei den finanzanlagen
5999159 die auswirkungen der finanzmarktkrise werden aus heutiger sicht zumindest bis in die erste jahresh lfte 2009 anhalten zudem bleibt abzuwarten ob und in welchem umfang die entwicklungen an den rohstoff und energiem rkten und die finanzmarktkrise auf die realwirtschaft mit negativen auswirkungen auf die kreditm rkte bergreifen sofern sich f r uns in der zweiten jahresh lfte keine zus tzlichen bewertungsbelastungen aus der finanzmarktkrise ergeben erwarten wir f r das gesamtjahr 2008 ein vorsteuer ergebnis von gut 300 mio euro

5999164 buy to let is an investment which combines both capital growth and income
5999165 when property prices drop the rental income becomes proportionally larger however when prices rise the rental income becomes proportionally smaller
5999166 over the long term though both the capital value of the property and the rental income should go up making buy to let a balanced investment
5999167 we are keeping a final salary scheme while some other companies have abandoned theirs
5999168 were also protecting current pensions with the changes only relevant to future service
5999169 it is common sense to assume the deficit will have grown even more
5999170 these changes are necessary to clear the past deficit and to contain the amount of future funding needed
5999171 it means working longer to get a similar amount of pension but one that is more secure
5999172 the union is concerned that there is little room for individuals to make a choice on when they retire on a full pension

5999182 their families in rome would pay good money to get them back
5999183 rome is desperate for soldiers now and imagine how they would welcome 8000 defenders into that empty city
5999184 these poor men have done nothing unworthy of roman soldiers
5999185 most of them were ordered to guard the camp during the battle of cannae and when they learned that the entire army had been destroyed what else could they do but surrender it would have been pointless to defend the empty camp
5999186 we are in effect telling our men that there is salvation to the soldier who manages to survive a battle that it is beautiful to die in defence of your country but if you dont feel like dying you can always surrender get ransomed and go home again no gentlemen a roman has two options out there in the field he beats the enemy or he dies fighting
5999187 you had lost all your allies and you expected from day to day to lose your city but you didnt forget your dignity and you didnt let yourselves lose sight of what had to be done you sent those representatives back to hannibal you foiled his scheme
5999188 and what happened to the wise guy who had tried to get out of his oath to return
5999189 your senate ordered him to be put in chains and returned to hannibal to do with him as he liked
5999190 there were also practical considerations in refusing to ransom those men
5999191 rome had just bought 2000 able bodied slaves from their owners to be soldiers to fill the ranks of the men who had been killed at cannae all the money we had left had to pay for weapons and food and horses we werent going to hand it to the enemy for gods sake probably under other circumstances those men would have been taken back
5999192 the army teaches us all what we have to do
5999193 in terms of preparing them for the world we need to redefine our attitudes towards traditional ideas of cheating unless the students have a conceptual understanding of the topic or what they are working on they cant access bits and pieces of information to support them in a task effectively
5999194 in their working lives they will never need to carry enormous amounts of information around in their heads
5999195 what they will need to do is access information from all their sources quickly and they will need to check the reliability of their information
5999196 i was a bit hesitant because i didnt know how it could help us but i dont think it is cheating after having done it twice it just helps you find information to answer the question appropriately

5999202 spc means finding slopes from the way the surface looks under different illuminations and once we know the slopes we can find the heights
5999203 we suspect that these residuals errors are primarily due to incorrect spacecraft position
5999204 in other words the orbits are not exactly correct we intend to solve for those orbits and then the new orbital data can be used to more accurately determine the bodys gravitational field
5999205 the ou initiative is the only major us initiative of its kind devoted to the problem of biodeterioration and biocorrosion
5999206 first we have to understand how mother nature cleans up these spills and we can do this by studying the way microorganisms interact with hydrocarbons
5999207 we want to better understand how organisms eat through these pipelines several fundamental mechanisms cause this problem but it is spotty and doesnt occur all of a sudden
5999208 rather biocorrosion occurs over a long period of time and we are using a series of new molecular and chemical tools to find out why and how this happens
5999209 we think cells grow in communities that adhere to the inner surface of pipelines and form three dimensional biofilms that can sometimes cause pitting once we understand what these microorganisms are doing we can interrupt their processes or diagnose them more effectively
5999210 because two thirds of us oil is still in place we can use these organisms to convert residual hydrocarbons into natural gas and create a new source of domestic energy
5999211 the concept of anaerobic metabolism is an innovative process and the ou initiative is the only one of its kind in the united states at the present time we are also experimenting with shales and other unconventional reservoirs

5999213 the car wash fundraiser is about as american as apple pie i dont know of a student boy girl scout or church group that hasnt participated in one
5999214 careful girls watch all that jumping around in those loose halter tops and teeny low riding shorts
5999215 if we didnt want to be as good we wouldnt do this
5999216 besides the girls are so pretty people want to help the kids
5999217 this car wash system is usually done in summer in the united states and canada a fund is generally raised in the name of a school sport association or for charity purposes the pretty school girls in bikinis call by the donors at the roadside with colorful cardboard signs and the cars are then washed by their male and female classmates at a nearby place

5999237 at this moment thaksins legal team is proceeding to ask for political asylum for thaksin and his family in britain
5999238 for that reason no one who has good intentions toward us and toward the western world should be afraid of it
5999239 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5999240 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5999241 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5999242 it is still possible that this is a coincidence but we wanted to make sure that thats not the case so weve asked for a different group of experts to come in and review the whole thing again and just see whether we missed anything
5999243 its an infection that entered through the umbilicus but it is unusual to have two very severe infections this close together thats why we want to make sure that we have an international expert like dr louie pull the team together and make sure were doing everything we can
5999244 obviously the election will not be in october 2009 and its obvious i will have to analyze the parliamentary situation
5999245 we did establish a fixed date for the next election
5999246 the fact of the matter what we will have to decide over the next few weeks is whether or not we can have a productive fall session of parliament
5999247 its not my job to go into an election because the prime minister asked me to go into an election my job is to replace him and timing is important
5999248 they are residents of that hotel its an old hotel so people live there
5999249 theres no interior fire protection to slow the fire down its an old old building they dont build buildings like this any more theres lots of wood and whatever in there its very challenging especially when you have to pull back and fight it from the outside
5999250 the fire is still hot and warm we havent begun our police investigation yet well begin that in earnest tomorrow
5999251 so i raced outside was somebody jumping out a window or something but it was luggage being thrown out the second floor window there were three suitcases and a laptop bag
5999252 when we got here there were people on the balcony trying to get out it was going pretty good when our crews arrived
5999253 this is our downtown area so you have residents here you have people staying here who need shelter on a 24 hour basis
5999254 were actually focusing on aspects that have to do with strategic and military situations but we will of course review everything
5999255 it does raise questions for all countries bordering russia when you see them not respecting international law and international borders
5999256 thats a concern its a concern for every country in the world when you have a country doing that
5999257 he might make some statements up there but in terms of how were going to punish the russians theres not much we can do
5999258 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5999259 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are occupying large parts of georgia i cannot see the nato russia council meeting
5999260 the future will depend on concrete actions from the russian side
5999261 no specific decisions on programs or projects with russia have been taken
5999262 there are different sensibilities on this there are states who want this process to move faster
5999263 the alliance has to take united firm position but without being aggressive
5999264 my whole career has been about resolving access issues this is my battle horse
5999265 private delivery is an accepted practice everywhere in the world and its time canada accepted this reality
5999266 ive never hidden what i do im not ashamed of it in fact im quite proud

5999269 develop a blueprint and timeline for transformational change in canadian health care to bring about patient focused care
5999270 it was such a necessary service that there wasnt much debate
5999271 rather than wait six months for a scan at a hospital we provided them in a couple of days
5999272 im not touting privatization of the whole health system nobody wants an american style health system least of all the cma
5999273 we must have a universal health system but it has to be accessible and responsive
5999274 the system isnt perfect but its working it shows the benefits of a good private public mix
5999275 you are the best person to get things moving and your actions could trigger a domino effect
5999276 dont be afraid to make bold proposals and express yourself as frankly as possible
5999277 we believe these people are affiliated with the red scorpions gang based in the lower mainland and were trying to establish a dial a dope operation in victoria
5999278 street level dealers were given crack cocaine to sell on behalf of the district managers they shared vehicles they shared a phone number and they worked in shifts
5999279 we certainly believe that weve made a dent in this group of the initial 11 members we identified seven are in custody one is on house arrest in the lower mainland and the other three are facing charges
5999280 all of them are connected and i believe two of them are members
5999281 france is resolved to pursue the battle against terrorism for democracy and freedom the cause is just and it is to the credit of france and its armed forces to defend it
5999282 the problem is not the number of soldiers but the mission they are sent on
5999283 this loss of life is absolutely deplorable but also could be anticipated when you have forces that enter an environment where their role is counter insurgency not peacekeeping or reconstruction
5999284 this is the first time a large number of foreign soldiers have been killed in the vicinity of the capital of afghanistan
5999285 last year all the big cities like kabul and kandahar were not under threat
5999286 but this year in kandahar many big attacks have happened
5999287 the taliban announced their intentions at the end of last year to aim to make access to the capital more difficult
5999288 and its strategic purpose is that it grabs a lot more international attention than just some far flung district and it makes life more difficult for ordinary citizens as well as the logistics of the military
5999289 we in canada have understood over the past several years how difficult this mission is

5999292 we can confirm donetsk have lodged a claim with fifa regarding this matter
5999293 its totally frustrating especially after flogging yourself for eight weeks in pre season and then just when you start to look forward to the games this happens
5999294 things were going really well i played out in bayonne in a friendly the week before felt in great shape and was looking forward to getting on the field against western force
5999295 you have to get a buzz out of it alright and i did to win an award like that against the all ireland champions
5999296 but to be quite honest it was all about winning a munster title that was more important looking at things at half time it was difficult to see a way through to pull it out of the fire like we did we were just delighted after
5999297 i suppose thats how we will be judged we know what were up against we havent done as well as wed have liked against them
5999298 we didnt perform really results would show that even though going into the games we thought we could beat them its hard to say why theyre a very good side their results have proven that putting back to back all irelands together
5999299 i dont think there is baggage really obviously these things linger in your mind i was just a sub though certainly id remember the games but i dont think theres a whole load of baggage
5999300 tthis team has been going for the last four or five years weve an amount of experience weve got to a good few semi finals in a row a final last year so its no flash in the pan setanta readers comment of the day

5999302 sergio is a good player but how do you continue to do what he does watson did it but watson did it at a young age two u s opens and a pga or two pgas and a u s open
5999303 but watson learned from that i should put this in a positive way watson was an awfully good putter and sergio it seems to be his nemesis
5999304 when youre a really good putter like harrington is you can make up for some errant shots
5999305 gary player used to have a terrible time finishing off tournaments but his short game was so great and he was such a good putter it didnt look like he was having trouble finishing it off because he didnt give it away
5999306 he was always able to find a way to get the ball in the hole and get it done and thats what a lot of guys do what harrington does and i did it on a lot of occasions
5999307 a lot of places i one putted five of the last six or seven greens to make sure i stayed in the tournament and got there and won
5999308 executives are forced to do more with less and their technology investments and budgets are more scrutinised than ever there needs to be an element of trusting their business partners and meet the boss will allow these industry stakeholders to collaborate and make decisions during a very difficult time this will better enhance their organisation by allowing them make better decisions and use their budgets more smartly
5999309 these executives are protected and this is what is missing from any other business networks out there they dont have the safety and security of being in a safe environment with peers and the top 10 global financial services organisations in the world dont have the ability to network within the c level and weve created a safe platform for them to do this
5999310 meet the boss will be a plethora of knowledge for executives and a cost saving mechanism for executives to share ideas and get referrals from people that are trusted

5999391 nature has developed all of this firepower for getting things into cells and one of the ways is to create entities that are arginine rich
5999392 arginine rich sequences appear to figure in the mechanisms by which many pathogens invade cells
5999393 its an exciting result to be able to take a drug known to work against cancer but stymied by resistant cells and restore it to effectiveness using an arginine transporter
5999394 this bodes well for use with other drugs that succumb to resistance
5999395 in essence the technology can be used to overcome one of the most challenging types of problems of drug resistance
5999396 if youre not recognized as being part of the club then youre kicked out
5999397 if we think of the pump as being a bouncer for the cellular club then effectively what were doing is disguising one of these therapeutic agents to get it in through the back door or the side door
5999398 this could potentially be used with any drug which is effective but has a delivery problem
5999399 as the transporter with all these arginine guanidinium groups approaches the cell it basically does a handshake using hydrogen bonds with cell surface constituents that are in the membrane
5999400 in essence it changes its physical properties by shaking hands with all these cell membrane components

5999405 to be a molecular signature a sequence has to be common to all members of a single domain of life but not another
5999406 until the 2000s when these structures became available you werent able to correlate where these signatures were with what was touching them in 3 d space
5999407 so nobody had ever done this sort of analysis before
5999408 the ramifications of this work are it gives you a much better way to probe how this universal machinery changes from one organism to another
5999409 in that the ribosome constitutes the core of the cellular translation mechanism which is the sine qua non of gene expression which is the essence of life as we know it these findings constitute a major step in understanding the evolution of life which is still a journey of a thousand miles

5999424 this is something that i started to anticipate years ago in my last job when we went through the last economic downturn
5999425 we were looking for ways to make it spend more flexible at the same time we were noticing new software offerings coming to the market that were better than legacy counterparts
5999426 we found in each application there were viable saas alternatives on the market
5999427 i found that the others on the management team were very amenable to utilizing saas and open source as a 100 goal
5999428 i think everybody agreed that this was a good way to go it needs to be in partnership with the business so we set about starting with salesforce com
5999429 i would say five or six years ago the model was looked at dubiously can i trust it
5999430 i think people are rapidly getting over their concerns because the model works for them
5999431 the people that tend to be afraid of it are people that are sometimes i think much more focused on their masterful running of their data centers and their infrastructure than they are on the solution itself
5999432 at a higher level when youre thinking about this saas strategy given the state of a lot of saas applications you could end up having to cobble together potentially more saas applications than you would in the on premise model
5999433 in theory you could think the space might evolve that way

5999445 the news in the tech sector helps a bit but it doesnt change the general mood weve seen four or five weeks of rebound but that recovery mood has been destroyed over the last few days by negative news flow from the banking sector
5999446 the sharp drop in commodity prices since mid july seems to have been priced in now in the best case the market is moving sideways with a negative touch
5999447 the banking system needs to continue rationalisation and we will see some mergers under pressure as theres not enough business around for the banks
5999448 its a binary outcome it can go one way or another

5999455 there was a question mark last year about apple that maybe it had taken its eye off the ball by concentrating on the iphone but now the iphone and ipod and mac are nicely aligned
5999456 most of apples windows based competition is suffering a bit from vista
5999457 complaints about vista are generating complaints about the computer makers
5999458 people know there have been some service and product quality problems but apple has an almost teflon like quality its problems dont really seem to matter to consumers
5999459 most lose it slowly like dell has which took a while and we see companies improve but apples extreme volatility is almost like its stock price
5999460 apple will be very difficult to catch but i dont think that these results where theres a ten point difference will hold

5999479 everything is still being discussed maybe spartak have already made a decision but i havent decided one way or the other
5999480 moreover the transfer to england which everyone is talking about would be a big problem for my family as we have a young child so we need to discuss it properly
5999481 i dont know because i have never been at a foreign club you need to try something first in order to know
5999482 on the one hand its easier as a pair but on the other alone the situation forces you to get used to new conditions quicker both language and life
5999483 everything will depend on what kind of offer will be made to the club and to me my move to a top club definitely would reflect well on the image of spartak
5999484 i love you but i love my wife and kids more
5999485 we were even short handed for this race not having moises aldape so we lost a guy who could have been a real difference maker

5999488 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
5999489 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
5999490 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines

5999493 dick i work in a small town last week a 180lbs kid had a diabetic attack and the two female medics on call could not lift him to carry him down some stairs they had to call the only cop on duty myself to help them carry this kid it made me feel great to be able to help someone but i thought about something what happens when my dad who lives out of town has a serious heart attack and the only people who can help him are women i wont always be around to carry patients for the ambulance crew i do my job and they should do theirs and if they cant they should quit

5999512 both of which have offered many opportunities for south africa to become part of the ever expanding supplier base
5999513 while the cav is important to us as a local industry it is interlinked to attracting original equipment manufacturers oems to south africa and will help us join the international market

5999560 higher than the question of our duration is the question of our deserving
5999561 i think i got my peaking right im just not as strong as these guys and this is the olympics these are the best sprinters in the world and like 20 25 making the final we havent seen that before
5999562 20 29 didnt even make it in athens 20 56 made the final but the event has moved on and hopefully i can move on again over the next few years and maybe next time can make the final
5999563 yeah i expected the other three to qualify and the last place to be between me chris williams jamaica and christian and he ran a stormer i couldnt believe it
5999564 ive hammered christian during the year but he ran a great bend and hes just got better with every race i think his injury troubles are finally behind him hes finding his groove again for the first time in years
5999565 hes found it just at the wrong time for me
5999566 ive clearly improved and come on another level this has probably come a year too early but it was a good championship for me
5999567 i knew 20 25 would probably make it and it did from both heats but i just didnt have that extra gear and i was moving up a class again
5999568 generally i think i was just a touch down most of the race it was just a tiny tiny fraction but i was fifth off the bend where id hoped to be fourth maybe and then tightened up
5999569 i had a great time out there i said id enjoy every minute of it because it doesnt come around very often theres 91 000 people there but you dont really see them until you finish
5999570 yeah i suppose so because how close can you be one place but i couldnt do any more ive improved and improved this year i ran 20 3 twice here and maybe next time i can run 20 2 twice
5999571 ive tried so hard and havent made it but im the number two european here a metre off the final against the best jamaicans and americans so i cant be too disappointed
5999572 i havent messed up ive just been a metre short

5999599 the laxity shown by central intelligence agencies for us national kenneth haywood for leaving the country when the maharashtra ats anti terrorist squad had served a lockout notice against him and he was still under investigation

5999601 its a fantastic achievement for mascherano to have the chance to win another gold medal is very positive for him for a player of his age to have won so many trophies and picked up so much experience is amazing
5999602 i have been talking with him during the competition because he is a player who always wants to know the news from back here he is enjoying the olympic games but he is aware of what is happening with liverpool
5999603 we know of athletes winning more than one gold medal in other sports but i dont know if its ever been done in football

5999607 we carried out an analysis of what pete doherty and his band does
5999608 what he does as part of his routine is to excite the crowd they speed up and then slow down the music and create a whirlpool effect in the crowd
5999609 the crowd all get worked up and then they start fighting

5999615 i was fortunate enough to go in 2002 so that enticed me to come back
5999616 its always nice to get off the season underway with a win
5999617 i think we are fully aware of the fact we didnt play to our best but the important thing is to get off to a good start with three points away from home
5999618 winning isnt all that matters but its important that you start the season well and finish it well we need to improve in all areas and thats what we are about anyway making sure we improve on a daily basis
5999619 we know we arent firing on all cylinders just yet but it was just nice to get off to a win particularly away from home
5999620 its bad news for holland that they went out but it means we get a player back

5999628 i was in the police force and realized nobody was filming i was never interested in doing documentary i was into spielberg flying dragons etc but documentary is all about risking your life to get the shot and when i went to film school in belgium pure fiction seemed artificial to me
5999629 when i did go to do a feature film it was in a documentary style something perhaps shown over the course of one day but even when youre maing documentaries you make choices
5999630 the survivors are my friends and it was important for me to tell this story though they were reluctant
5999631 the natural light inspired the survivors to talk to me and it jarred fragments of their memory these arent re enactments but the atmosphere recalls the situation from long ago
5999632 the story im telling is true but its so unreal
5999633 i felt it was important to hae some stylized reconstructions to show how this could occur its like a heist story because philippe had watched police films and that is what inspired him to plan and break into the twin towers with all these other goof balls around him i think thats why i think it works in america because it recalls superheroes like batman but its real hes sort of a superhero doing this and its subversive at the same time
5999634 in snow it is a combination of documentary style with articism to achieve a poetic film that is also naturalistic
5999635 the camera was held on the shoulder so as to bring out whats inside the character
5999636 any art is a metaphor and should be a balance between naturalism and artifice its dangerous to go too far into naturalism as in the dogma movement or too far in artifice as in amelie theres a constant struggle between both
5999637 the camera is a window to reality thats quite basic to cinema
5999638 before i did cinema i learned to manipulate pictures and they seemed as real to me as all other pictures i take a documentary of reality and then manipulate it i can shoot something that doesnt seem realistic but appears so
5999639 i agree and disagree im a total control freak there are scenes you can improvise but only when you come totally prepared with your vision its like boxes the actor and the cameraman can dow what they want within that box but if they go outside the box i invision then i bring them back in
5999640 for me the camera is not valid most of the images i see are on the internet

5999642 im going to have cute boobs till im 90 so theres that
5999643 ill have the best boobs in the nursing home ill be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
5999644 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it
5999645 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
5999646 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes
5999647 and i think that its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
5999648 i love living and i really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming yeah ill face challenges but you cant get any darker than where ive been so knowing that in my soul gave me the strength to just say i have to get out there and make this a positive

5999718 there are benefits for both companies in the proposed merger
5999719 our challenge is to establish beatthatquote com a brand with a unique service offering and a strong entrepreneurial ethos as the first genuine brand in what is still a very immature market
5999720 the online price comparison marketplace is growing exponentially at the moment but even people who have used one of these websites dont have any kind of relationship with or loyalty to the players which currently dominate the category
5999721 beatthatquote is a young aggressive ambitious company we needed to find an agency partner who would bring to life our offering in an impactful and differentiating way leagas delaney really impressed us

5999727 vehicle safety technologies are regularly identified in state and federal road safety strategies as a countermeasure to the number of crashes and injuries
5999728 the victorian and federal governments have not taken sufficient steps to ensure that vehicle safety in australia keeps pace with international developments
5999729 ideally they need to be standard if not you need to be able to buy them at a minimum cost to encourage people to have them in the car
5999730 they arent like a stereo or leather seats that you use every day people quite often have trouble perceiving the value of these things
5999731 really an education program needs to be had so that people realise that these could be the most valuable things they ever buy in that they save their lives
5999732 thats the sort of gain we could get if we adopted absolute best practice
5999733 four emergency service staff were taken to a nearby hospital after suffering smoke related injuries and nine people who were in the building also suffered from smoke inhalation

5999742 its not a box problem its freeview they have changed the transmitter range thats the reason it cannot work

5999744 together with the manufacturers were doing all we can to help viewers find the best value replacement box
5999745 i can afford a replacement but there are an awful lot of people for whom the replacement box and installation is an awful lot of money
5999746 if not it will come down to a decision from the players
5999747 our position is that we cant recommend that our players should tour pakistan
5999748 our safety concerns are very much based on the report that was supplied by the icc and the report of the fica world players body commission which the pakistan board has and the report that reg dickason completed for cricket australia
5999749 we have considerable reservations as do our players and the australian cricketers association
5999750 the icc understands the considerable reservations that we new zealand england south africa and perhaps some others hold
5999751 we have been advised that they icc will meet on the 20th of august to consider that situation
5999752 were hoping that the icc will give us some advice some sort of certainty within the next 24 hours about what the next step in this process is
5999753 hopefully that will allow greater clarity about whats going on and we can all get on with making the decisions that we need to make
5999754 we will not put them in a situation if we get specialist advice that tells us that its not safe to do that
5999755 the security advice does not give us any great encouragement at the moment
5999756 we discussed with them our concerns about the advice that we have got on security which would appear to be contrary to their advice to us and we are waiting now for their response
5999757 if it comes to pass that it is suggested we go to sri lanka then we would need to have a look at that issue on the same basis that we have looked at the pakistan issue
5999758 as far as we are concerned the tournament continues in pakistan
5999759 sri lanka has its own set of problems we havent been through the process of analysing them yet

5999769 we could not have carried out a better operation in the mossad than to place a man like ahmadinejad in power in iran
5999770 on this question we fully support russia georgia started this crisis but the west is blaming russia
5999771 the war which exploded in georgia is the apogee of western efforts to encircle and isolate russia
5999772 military and technical cooperation of course is the main issue
5999773 i wanted to be able to tell the judge what the cause of death was not my theory of what it was
5999774 we do not want to see the government setting military targets for political purposes
5999775 weve got a lot of young blokes in there a lot of first year players and first game players so to get a win for them would be great and to sing the club song would be really good
5999776 to get some real positives out of the season these last two games it would be good to win both
5999777 we havent really thought about it much well just treat them as even a top eight side theyre going along alright and we just want to see how we go against a team that we think we should beat
5999778 dean knows a fair bit about the insides and everything that works at the club but we know he has a certain style as well so it works both ways and hopefully the players come out on top on the day

5999786 mean average plasma total homocysteine concentration was reduced by 30 percent after 1 year of treatment in the groups receiving folic acid and vitamin b12
5999787 we found a numerically lower incidence of stroke and higher incidence of cancer in the groups receiving folic acid but these observations were not statistically significant
5999788 our findings do not support the use of b vitamins as secondary prevention in patients with coronary artery disease
5999789 the study suggests that the critical ingredient in smoking that may be causing emphysema is cadmium a well known contaminant of cigarette smoke
5999790 the worry is if you are exposed to this cadmium through other sources you can also be at risk for emphysema
5999791 vap is a relatively common infection and increasingly one caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria
5999792 there have been many attempts to prevent vap most of which have revolved around modifying hospital practices the silver coated endotracheal tube has an advantage in that it doesnt require any additional effort by nurses therapists and doctors who may already be over burdened
5999793 i think this is just the beginning for this kind of technology the silver polymer coating will most likely be applied also to tracheostomy tubes and also become available for use in pediatric medicine in the future we could see other types of coatings with other functions placed on devices that come into contact with the body

5999799 had no idea what it takes to run an election campaign
5999800 we are not going to mount a long drawn out campaign the idea is to hit the ground hard shortly before the actual elections that way the message is fresh and uppermost in peoples minds more importantly by then voters are already fatigued by the endless opposition posters and messages
5999801 there is much to be done and the mood among voters is no longer to give the anc a blank cheque
5999802 most family history enthusiasts will treat this news with absolute dismay it appears to be yet another example of government getting it wrong when it comes to big contracts
5999803 it is a pity that what could have been a flagship service has not been created due it appears to incompetence and penny pinching
5999804 many genealogists and family historians are upset that not only has the frc been closed earlier than was planned but the old paper indexes have been completely withdrawn
5999805 this was not meant to happen until new improved indexes were available something which now seems a very distant prospect

5999808 god if you still speak to people speak to me i will listen and i will do my best to obey
5999809 okay god in case thats you i will buy the milk
5999810 go and give the milk to the people in the house across the street
5999811 lord this is crazy those people are probably asleep and if i wake them up they are going to be mad and ill just look stupid
5999812 okay god if this is your will ill take the milk to the house even if i end of looking like a stupid fool i want to be obedient but if they dont answer right away i am out of here
5999813 we were just praying my wife has no milk and we had some big bills this month so we ran out of money to buy milk for the baby i was just praying and asking god to show me how to get some milk
5999814 i ask him to send an angel with some milk are you an angel
5999815 i just have a little problem i think with portion control
5999816 well you know that if you dont control what you eat then all of your time and money spent here is wasted
5999817 we need to solve some serious problems our income is 1m a year our current upkeep costs are also running at 1m a year but this doesnt cover all the work that needs to be done
5999818 for example huts 3 and 6 where the teams using the enigma machine for codebreaking and analysis took place need urgent repairs we also need to repair and upgrade basic infrastructure such as communications power and drains

5999822 it was a tough race i was trying to convince myself that it was a training test it took a lot of willpower to convince myself but i did it
5999823 its a competition after all and the best athlete wins how can i just stop and let somebody else win how can i let other girls take my medal
5999824 i actually worked as hard as anybody else and i dont think its a question at all
5999825 it has not sunk in at all but im so pleased to have a silver medal i might have a little cry later
5999826 some things do happen in races and i think a lot of it is unsportsmanlike but after races emotions can run high thats all i want to say about it i dont want to sit and slag anybody else off at the end of the day i have the medal
5999827 ten kilometers is a long distance and there are a lot of girls in quite a short distance and in a short space at the start you have clashes on and when you are swimming you knock on each other that does happen that is the hard part of the race
5999828 its difficult i myself had to clash on numerous occasions especially with the swimmers from brazil the last stretch was particularly difficult i had to via away all the time
5999829 i didnt see i was given a yellow card perhaps at the time when i was trying to break away from the two brazilian swimmers who were quite aggressive sometimes bordering on being unsportsmanlike this is swimming after all not boxing
5999830 even if you are a super star it doesnt mean anything when it comes to open water
5999831 for me this is dream come true i think im a bit upset as i wanted to come in the top five but i even couldnt get out of the water at the finish so ive done everything i possible could im glad its over
5999832 the greatest success of the iwf is the co operation weve fostered in isps search providers and other industry bodies without the need for legislation
5999833 people think there are millions of these sites but there are only about 3 000 sites active worldwide at any given time
5999834 some sites have names that are clearly designed to lure child abusers and i know of one in particular that was registered more than 10 years ago it simply should not be possible to register such website names
5999835 of course military and technical cooperation is the main issue weapons purchases are very important
5999836 i think that in russia and in the world everyone is now aware of israels role and its military consultants in the georgian crisis
5999837 and if before in russia there were people who thought these forces can be friendly then now i think no one thinks that way

5999877 i think that in russia and in the world everyone is now aware of israels role and its military consultants in the georgian crisis

5999885 database archiving often fails to get the attention it needs compared to other critical activities related to production databases and data warehouses
5999886 an archival system becomes critical when you need to access archived information in response to a legal summons customer service issue security investigation or technical issue the value of archiving grows considerably as it becomes easier to access the archived data
5999887 with legal demands for access growing conventional approaches to database archiving are increasingly being found lacking they focus on lifting and shifting inactive data from production databases to improve application performance without considering how to optimize the way archived data is stored get your archiving right and you reduce storage costs and guarantee simple future proofed access get it wrong and at worst you could face prison
5999888 why database archiving should be part of your dbms strategy
5999889 it managers need to achieve a balance between the compliance demands for retention and the business demand for economical storage and retrieval current database management system technology is optimised for transactional processing data warehouses are optimised for analytics but both fail to adequately address archiving needs worse still the lines between archive stores and backup which have very different drivers and requirements are all too often blurred
5999890 forresters research clearly illustrates the need for the new generation of archive stores these deliver both massive reductions in storage footprints through data compression together with the security immutability and point in time query capability that enables quick simple and unimpeachable fulfilment of regulatory obligations

5999935 weve seen ehealthforum triple its traffic in a year 15 percent in the last two months actually more noticeably a dramatic increase of visitors to our ask a doctor section on average over 100 people are seeking our doctors advice per day it has become apparent that more and more people are checking out medical advice online before visiting their regular doctor or they want a second opinion
5999936 more and more people find the unconditional support from others in our forums play a significant role in the healing process indeed many of our visitors go on to become volunteers posting responses help and support on other peoples posts caring and sharing is a great healer in itself many of our visitors discover that others have had similar experiences which they find enormously helpful a problem shared is a problem halved and thats half the battle
5999937 as technology develops i think we might see more and more people turn to online consultations and i hope to be on the edge of that movement

5999944 ideally they need to be standard if not you need to be able to buy them at a minimum cost to encourage people to have them in the car
5999945 they arent like a stereo or leather seats that you use every day people quite often have trouble perceiving the value of these things
5999946 really an education program needs to be had so that people realise that these could be the most valuable things they ever buy in that they save their lives
5999947 thats the sort of gain we could get if we adopted absolute best practice
5999948 if not it will come down to a decision from the players
5999949 our position is that we cant recommend that our players should tour pakistan
5999950 our safety concerns are very much based on the report that was supplied by the icc and the report of the fica world players body commission which the pakistan board has and the report that reg dickason completed for cricket australia
5999951 we have considerable reservations as do our players and the australian cricketers association
5999952 the icc understands the considerable reservations that we new zealand england south africa and perhaps some others hold
5999953 we have been advised that they icc will meet on the 20th of august to consider that situation
5999954 were hoping that the icc will give us some advice some sort of certainty within the next 24 hours about what the next step in this process is
5999955 hopefully that will allow greater clarity about whats going on and we can all get on with making the decisions that we need to make
5999956 we will not put them in a situation if we get specialist advice that tells us that its not safe to do that
5999957 the security advice does not give us any great encouragement at the moment
5999958 we discussed with them our concerns about the advice that we have got on security which would appear to be contrary to their advice to us and we are waiting now for their response
5999959 if it comes to pass that it is suggested we go to sri lanka then we would need to have a look at that issue on the same basis that we have looked at the pakistan issue
5999960 as far as we are concerned the tournament continues in pakistan
5999961 sri lanka has its own set of problems we havent been through the process of analysing them yet
5999962 we advise you to reconsider your need to travel to sri lanka at this time because of the very high risk of politically motivated violence

5999987 he can run that kind of campaign and frankly thats how political campaigns have been run in recent years but i believe the american people are better than that i believe that this defining moment demands something more of us
5999988 i have never suggested and never will that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition
5999989 i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5999990 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5999991 i love america so do you and so does john mccain
5999992 barack obama has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in iraq is more important to him than victory in iraq thats not a criticism of his patriotism thats a criticism of his judgment
5999993 senator mccain predicted that wed be greeted as liberators and that the iraqis would bear the cost of rebuilding through their bountiful oil revenues for the good of our country i wish he had been right and i had been wrong but thats not what history shows
5999994 so for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
5999995 the american people know that john mccain will hunt down terrorists wherever they are
