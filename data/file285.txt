2850046 from as young as i can remember until i was a young woman its physically demanding and requires absolute control over your movements
2850047 well good i dont really want you to picture me in a tutu

2850051 i doubt theres any human who can answer that question
2850052 chances like letting off a gun and waking up a flock of noisy birds werent you only stressing the need to be quiet a moment ago

2850056 maybe it just doesnt have ready access to a tailor look lets keep our distance from it if theres one thing ive learned about the twisted forests its not just that things change here its that whatever causes that change is contagious
2850057 there used to be towns and cities and roads around the forest just grew over the top of it up through it rather trees of types never seen before splitting open the pavement and growing faster than youd think possible

2850066 i have been passed some correspondence which tells the shocking story of the apparent suppression of a traditionalist catholic parish in the diocese of leeds
2850067 this is a parish that does exactly what the holy father tells us to do celebrating the mass reverently in the old and new forms the bishop is determined to squash it and to destroy me because he doesnt want me moving to another parish and doing the same thing
2850068 the bishop believes your ministry to be divisive is uncertain that ordinary pastoral care of parishioners is taking place and does not have confidence that you will celebrate the ordinary form of the mass with a generous heart for the vast majority of parishioners who expect sunday and weekday masses to be in english and at an altar facing the people

2850175 there is a name every day that is the nature of the business
2850176 i cant answer it because ive not got a direct answer
2850177 its possible we could sign someone this week we are trying weve got one or two options we are looking at and hopefully we can get something done before the start of the season
2850178 it has been pressing since the end of last season we like to operate with four strikers and we have not been able to do that
2850179 rio is now the best centre half in the world by far
2850180 that was an exemplary performance he did not give one foul away and intercepted every ball that came towards him
2850181 he broke out of defence in comfort so many times it was unbelievable he is a magnificent player
2850182 he is 30 now and because he has experience his potential is now being fulfilled in a big way
2850183 i was down and he stamped on me i thought he could have avoided me there was no need for it that was why i reacted and why i grabbed his leg
2850184 we came here with just 18 players and we know we are going to need a bigger squad because of the extra demands on the uefa cup which is new ground for us
2850185 it is going to take a lot for players to play saturday thursday sunday but we have to be competitive
2850186 you just have to take it on and give it a go
2850187 when i started making putts i just stuck in there and it brought my game up the more i got into it the better i played
2850188 i was comfortable with my game in winning the open this week i havent been as confident and comfortable but i knew i had the ability to win if i got a chance
2850189 its ugly and excessive a slap in the face to roman citizens if it was up to me id demolish it completely but because we havent got the money this is not possible
2850190 we are a city enslaved by its past so hung up on being the home of art culture and creativity that it doesnt realize that in reality it is static and hostage to politicians archaeologists and intellectuals who talk and talk but do nothing
2850191 its disgusting they put modernity right next to these two ancient churches covering them
2850192 unfortunately this is a city where that kind of architecture just wont be accepted
2850193 this is a sad legacy of the previous administration imposed on citizens from the top by two mayors who wanted it at any cost
2850194 care homes can be such miserable places you sit there all day staring out the window with no one to talk to
2850195 i thought it would be lovely to give a home and family life to one or two people who would otherwise be sitting around there
2850196 i started asking people if they wanted to move out of their care homes and live with me and ive had dozens of offers they are queuing up
2850197 its nice for me too because at my age its handy to have someone to live with now every book that sells will help towards making a home for someone
2850198 we were not very effective against st mirren you have to congratulate them for the way they played but we didnt have the imagination to break them down and we have to look at ourselves
2850199 i would have thought raising the league flag before the game and the party atmosphere would have inspired the players but that didnt happen
2850200 it could be a good result by the end of the season but as a coach you look at the performance and we will have to work to improve
2850201 im happy to see marc signing as he can pass the ball 15 yards and we couldnt do that very well on sunday
2850202 he brings passing ability imagination and a bit of zest but we have good players here so he will have to work hard before he gets a game
2850203 it was a lie from the beginning throughout the war and even today
2850204 it was a lie from the beginning throughout the war and even today
2850205 now you watch it all the way to impact and i mean its very vivid its right there and personal so it does stay in peoples minds for a long time
2850206 it is quite different going from potentially shooting a missile then going to your kids soccer game
2850207 you do stick around and see the aftermath of what you did and that does personalize the fight
2850208 you have a pretty good optical picture of the individuals on the ground the images can be pretty graphic pretty vivid and those are the things we try to offset we know that some folks have in some cases problems
2850209 no ones been naive enough to come in to interview but not know about that aspect of the job
2850210 theyre putting a missile down somebodys chimney and taking out bad guys and the next thing theyre taking their wife out to dinner their kids to school
2850211 a lot of them have told me im glad ive got the hour drive it gives them that whole amount of time to leave it behind
2850212 they get in their bus or car and they go into a zone they say for
2850213 if we can have an effect there where we can take people out thats a real plus in terms of saving american lives
2850214 it was a lie from the beginning throughout the war and even today
2850215 he will serve out the rest of his sentence at that time he will still be considered an enemy combatant
2850216 worsening economic prospects especially for the domesticeconomy are persistently strong
2850217 that is obvious from the absence of profit taking when the10 year yield declined below 1 5 percent some investors arelikely taking advantage of the holiday thinned market to shopwhile they can
2850218 i didnt know what i was going to do about it its very kind and very thoughtful of these gentlemen to help out im most grateful
2850219 weve been able to muster a pretty big team at pretty short notice
2850220 we are going to strengthen the security at scenic spots to make sure no sharp weapons can be brought into the area
2850221 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
2850222 its just an utter tragedy its as simple as that theres nothing to hang it on its just a crazy man
2850223 how do you live with that how do you live with any of it the mind just doesnt want to comprehend any of it really its just so random and incredible
2850224 this will be the last opportunity to purchase these stunning units at realistic prices they will sell well below the replacement cost we are all excited as is the market
2850225 the fact that its a mortgagee sale will attract interest on its own because we dont see that many of them here a cynic may say its a great marketing ploy
2850226 we really feel for those people because we dont want them to be discouraged by this sort of thing happening
2850227 any people that still feel strongly about events that occurred to them thousands of years ago will surely survive as a people and persevere
2850228 g d if you find me a parking place i promise that ill eat only kosher respect shabbat and all the holidays

2850259 good self management awareness and improved access to specialist diabetes care services are crucial if we are to curb this growing health crisis and see a reduction in the number of people dying from diabetes and complications attributed to the condition
2850260 with the economy slowing and energy bills on the rise it is totally unacceptable that hard pressed businesses are left so open to exploitation by energy suppliers
2850261 thames customers have enjoyed the lowest bills in the industry for many years but we now need to make essential investment to secure their services for the future
2850262 this is particularly true for london where the water and sewerage infrastructure is ageing there will be an inevitable impact on bills but even so we will be able to keep them below the industry average
2850263 the nhs should be available to all who need it yet 1 300 cancer patients were denied the treatment that could have made all the difference to them this audit shows that the exceptional cases process is in chaos and patients are suffering
2850264 we urge the government to accept our 10 point plan to end this bizarre and demeaning lottery
2850265 think of your own desires to manifest as having been placed there by spirit and that those desires which are housed in love and service are precisely what god wants to give you and that your desire is the direct path to receiving those blessings let go of the idea that desire is selfishness and remind yourself that if you had no desires ever you would still be living an infantile existence with toys in a sandbox whenever you feel unworthy of having your manifestations arrive remind yourself that no one is unworthy and that the same divine energy that flows through you flows through all of gods children and that all are worthy this includes you your desires are the very tools that allow you to grow and experience the perfection of the universe they take you beyond any limitations you might have embraced and lead you to a higher spiritual awareness
2850266 laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshiping here in beijing china you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion

2850272 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area

2850278 what could i do shoot him and go to jail it was all a matter of seconds and the police came pretty quickly two police officers pulled him off her by force
2850279 they fought he was like goliath and she so tiny
2850280 wow thats crazy i cant go three days without it
2850281 that we have to stick to the sunnah and follow the tradition of our beloved prophet muhammad s i told her that i totally agree she said
2850282 sorry but im not your husband and i cant shake your hand especially if your young and attractive
2850283 i was terrified for my girls if they hadnt been here it would have been a different kettle of fish i just thought if i pass out i wont be able to look after my girls
2850284 he grabbed my left hand put it down on the bench and started slowly pushing the knife into my hand
2850285 he was very calm he was very collected he wasnt looking sideways he didnt look nervous we thought it must have been a case of mistaken identity
2850286 a scumbag like this comes into your house and does this to you whether he gets caught or not its a small price to pay for the amount of terror he has caused in a neighbourhood
2850287 ive been through some pretty hairy things in the past and im not afraid of dying its just my wife and my family we are going to light this house up like a christmas tree now i dont want to be outside after dark anymore

2850291 it is awesome to see how passionate and excited they new zealanders are to be competing in beijing and i know they have all worked hard to have the opportunity to fulfil their olympic dreams

2850305 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2850306 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2850307 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2850308 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2850309 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
2850310 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2850311 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
2850312 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2850313 we were actually getting ready to schedule a trip to memphis to talk to isaac
2850314 isaac hayes was a wonderful human begin and his spirit will live long in the form of his music

2850318 el pa s ha expresado que las dos visiones tienen que ser compatibilizadas creo que lo mas importante es impulsar el dialogo y no seguir intentando desconocerse una a la otra
2850319 dijo guido riveros director de una fundaci n de apoyo a la democracia
2850320 la lectura preliminar del referendo es que se va a profundizar much simo m s la crisis pol tica y la tensi n en el pa s
2850321 si bien el presidente ha obtenido una votaci n alta los prefectos que son adversos al gobierno logran una votaci n que legitima sus posiciones y los fortalece
2850322 es un perfeccionamiento del resultado del comicio general del 2005
2850323 el primer paso consiste en intervenir en los mercados a los efectos de adelantar servicios de deuda que deber an afrontarse en los pr ximos meses y el a o entrante
2850324 el gobierno ha decidido en el d a de la fecha iniciar un
2850325 se sustenta en la oportunidad que ofrece el valor de mercado registrado por los t tulos de deuda nacional en las ltimas jornadas cotizaciones que en nada se corresponden con la solidez de las variables econ micas y sociales que rigen en nuestro pa s
2850326 el valor de algunas de las especies de t tulos nacionales se encuentran tan injustificadamente deprimido que el gobierno
2850327 so really i would be just renewing my involvement in local government
2850328 my wifes right behind this decision and says i would do a good job having been involved in community life in bathurst for so long
2850329 i came to bathurst in 1984 and have been teaching at kelso high school since 1991
2850330 obviously i am well known for my involvement in junior sport but any vote for me is a positive vote for someone who wants the best for bathurst really theres no better place to live
2850331 i think its a matter of steady as she goes and consolidating on what weve already got
2850332 weve got great facilities but they have to be maintained and promoted
2850333 i wrote a letter to the premier two weeks ago saying it is not a good investment
2850334 i the mayor of bathurst and a delegation will meet with the premier today to discuss the issue of developing mount panorama further
2850335 basically we want to know why they would start building a new circuit when we have a fully fledged motor racing track here already
2850336 if completed a second smaller track might be able to support a v8 sprint race but would also meet the regulations for holding international motorcycle events
2850337 the rest of the year it could be used for driver training or testing facilities
2850338 we would need to attain a significant amount of federal and state funding if the second track was to go ahead as the cost of it would be too big for bathurst regional council alone
2850339 we also need to ensure the interests of the residents on mount panorama are looked after and their concerns are also heard
2850340 recycling doing our bit to reduce global warming supporting the citys young people and ensuring our sporting facilities remain up to scratch are issues which are important to me
2850341 and it would be nice to get to the stage where the kids dont have to pack up and leave town to get a job once they leave school or uni
2850342 past councils have showed some real vision especially the decision to increase the capacity of our water supply at chifley dam
2850343 theres some good projects on the horizon as well with the adventure playground and proposed retirement village at eglinton
2850344 i think the new councils job is to ensure it keeps looking to the future while being prudent with its finances it should also be sympathetic to the demands people who run small businesses face
2850345 theres a real need for dedicated facilities for cyclists in the city though
2850346 estoy sorprendido por el sentimiento patri tico del pueblo por la vocaci n democr tica de votar en paz mi respeto y admiraci n al pueblo
2850347 mi gran sue o es que haya una gran unidad del pueblo boliviano

2850349 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
2850350 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
2850351 abandon the idea that the afghan government will be under its control
2850352 we do not want to be the slaves or puppets of other countries
2850353 the military institution says it is ok to kill and use the most horrible weapons and that killing the enemy is heroic
2850354 i respect dick for having humanity over his military obligations
2850355 the regular people and the government wanted to surrender but the military people didnt want to surrender
2850356 i believe it is the stubbornness of the military people that caused the bombing of japan
2850357 we are very pleased with the courts ruling and are moving forward aggressively to build sufficient product inventories to support the increased demand for our vascular sheath product lines

2850386 they were discussing the difficulties inherent in the facts that a they were falling in love with each other while b the vampire was particularly attracted to the scent of her blood and was having a difficult time restraining himself from killing her immediately
2850387 overall its been a true labor of love love for edward and bella and all the rest of my imaginary friends and im thrilled that other people get to meet them now
2850388 there is no way it fits with the culturally sophisticated brand i wish to sell
2850389 ive never done an ebay auction before so i didnt know what to expect but i am upset and frustrated after someone from bristol bid 10m and ive since found out she hasnt got that sort of money
2850390 ive spoken to ebay and the bid stands there are also bids for 9m on there from other people but if the 10m bid is won then that person wont be able to pay for the estate and the auction will have been a waste of time it feels like people have been scuppering my genuine auction

2850394 the class is something that meets the needs of our students and the board was very supportive
2850395 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2850396 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2850397 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2850398 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2850399 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2850400 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2850401 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2850434 for the quezada and trevillian families and the hundreds of thousands diagnosed with multiple sclerosis across the country there are very few known sources of scholarship assistance specially targeted for these families

2850437 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities mr hotchkies said on the sidelines of a notorious annual defcon gathering of hackers in las vegas
2850438 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2850439 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty said hotchkies who saw a spike this year in the number of defcon attendees carrying macintosh laptops
2850440 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2850441 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple hotchkies said
2850442 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2850443 jail break because it liberates iphone models from the shackles of deals apple has with telecom giants providing exclusive service to the devices in varying countries
2850444 it shows people are getting proficient at analyzing apple software hotchkies said
2850445 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised

2850448 just the other day he was telling me that if he kept playing the way he was and the team kept playing the way they were they could probably make the playoffs
2850449 carlos was really excited about this season and thought they could still make the playoffs
2850450 carlos would tell me you know with miguel tejada and lance berkman and everybody hitting and hunter pence running around crazy we could get in those playoffs carlos was always positve and you can tell he thought they could get in the playoffs

2850457 such operations against economic resources we think have a deterrence characteristic in the war that aims to annihilate a people in turkey naturally our operations will continue if the turkish state persists in this war
2850458 we think that attacks against economic resources have a deterrence effect in a war that aims to annihilate a people if the turkish state insists on waging the war similar operations by us will continue
2850459 naturally such operations will continue if the turkish state insists on war
2850460 we think that attacks against economic resources have a deterrence effect in a war that aims to annihilate a people if the turkish state insists on waging the war similar operations by us will continue
2850461 our hpg forces conducted a sabotage operation against a cargo train that was carrying military materiel heading from tatvan to mu after the sabotage operation one wagon was destroyed completely and four were derailed and turned over after the operation two cobra type helicopters which came to the scene of the derailment randomly bombed the area
2850462 while enemy casualties in this vehicle are still not clarified three enemy troops were killed and three were wounded in the operation which began after the ambush
2850463 the period since 1993 is full of calls for democratic dialog ceasefire announcements peace packages and projects however despite all these efforts the turkish state continues its denial and annihilation policies
2850464 despite our persistent approach and declarations of unilateral ceasefires denial policies and annihilation operations create an unresolved and chaotic environment
2850465 as the kurdistan peoples freedom struggle defense force hpg we endeavored not to intensify the clashes and were very concerned about this however especially in recent years isolationist policies and psychological warfare directed particularly against our leadership that went beyond limits forced us as an army into a defense war with great intensity the attempts to lynch our people in the 2008 spring newroz celebration overdosed annihilation attacks within turkeys boundaries and also the aerial and land attacks against our guerrilla forces in south kurdistan naturally and rightfully necesitated our raising the bar of our legal self defense struggle
2850466 targeting the economic resources which nourish the war that the turkish state implements against the kurdish people and democratic advanced humanity came about in these bases
2850467 such operations against economic resources we think have a deterrence characteristic in the war that aims to annihilate a people in turkey naturally our operations will continue if the turkish state persists in this war

2850481 defenderemos hasta las ltimas consecuencias nuestras tierras y espacios sagrados
2850482 comenzando por el se or alcalde de puerto saavedra sr ricardo tripainao calfulaf por cuanto l fue quien autoriz y propici la construcci n de dicha carretera usando a las personas con enga o diciendo mejoramiento de camino pasando por encima de los estudios de impactos ambiental sociocultural llevado a cabo por la universidad de la frontera adem s el ministerio de obras p blicas y la intendencia estaban en conocimiento de los hechos y acontecimientos acaecidos en dicho territorio

2850496 last year we were able to hold a roster spot open for gary as he attempted to make a monumental comeback after he underwent a knee scope last week we are unfortunately not in a position to hold a roster spot this year we are releasing gary today in hopes he will be able to continue his rehab and get back into the nfl either with another team or possibly with the browns gary has made tremendous strides thus far and we believe he can play professional football again in the future
2850497 home plate looked to be about 120 feet away when i came in the game

2850501 im not too happy about it i mean i shouldnt have been there in the state that i was in but i wasnt really thinking there would be someone driving past with a video camera on the roof filming me either

2850516 the ocean is a genetically distinct environment and the single most diverse source of new molecules to be discovered
2850517 we have only scratched the surface of the chemical diversity in the ocean
2850518 this gene has been associated with a combination of kidney and eye disease in human patients
2850519 here we found a mutation that affects only the eyes suggesting that this gene might be a candidate for human patients with eye disease only
2850520 the new information that the nphp4 gene can be involved in eye diseases only can shed light on the etiology of some low frequency eye diseases in people where similar mutations may be involved
2850521 this is the first step in the development of an electric field refrigeration unit
2850522 for the future we can envision a flat panel refrigerator no more coils no more compressors just solid polymer with appropriate heat exchangers

2850524 referees decisions will tip the scales when athletes are relatively well matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior
2850525 although there is a need for further research including research on the effects of different colors our results suggest a need to change the rules or support referees by providing electronic decision making aids in those sports in which this color bias may be a problem
2850526 expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now

2850528 an illegal prior restraint on legitimate academic research in violation of the first amendment
2850529 we wanted to share our academic work with the security community and had planned to withhold a key detail of our results so that a malicious attacker could not use our research for fraudulent purposes were disappointed that the court is preventing us from presenting our findings even with this safeguard
2850530 helllllo browns fans hollie strano here from wkycs morning show giving you the latest for tonights game
2850531 just everywhere out here laid out on the ground they are bloody
2850532 we thought it would be better for him to get on the bus because its a far drive
2850533 now he keeps saying that he should have driven himself
2850534 they have helped immensely in the baghdad area in particular to take down the al qaeda car bomb networks and other al qaeda operations in iraqs capital city so they have done a phenomenal job in that regard
2850535 they have exceptional initiative exceptional skill exceptional courage and i think exceptional savvy i cant say enough about how impressive they are in thinking on their feet
2850536 there were iraqi accommodations in basra there were coalition accommodations in basra there were deals
2850537 i was very upfront about that in fact when i came through london on the way home from congress in september and noted that thats how you end these kinds of endeavours sometimes the deals work out well and sometimes they dont and when they dont then you have to go back and rectify the situation
2850538 there is no question that the militia criminality and violence in basra had reached intolerable levels thats why prime minister maliki ordered the operation there
2850539 the early days there were dicey there is no question about it and it was an urban combat zone it was a fight
2850540 and once again i have reiterated the importance that we put on the british contribution
2850541 everyone is watching and waiting right now to see if in fact iran is going to continue to together with help from lebanese hezbollah train equip and fund organisations that are a destabilising force in iraq
2850542 every situation has its own context its own circumstances and the key of course is an accurate and nuanced understanding of the conditions of the situation and the crafting of an approach that is appropriate for that context
2850543 we have to work with our colleagues our partners in pakistan as well as those in afghanistan in trying to graft a comprehensive approach for the entire region or that sub region
2850544 we are very actively analysing the situation and our various options
2850545 we think that both candidates having seen iraq recently have seen the progress that has been made are aware of the both the steps forward and the additional steps that need to be taken
2850546 but again i would still be cautious of my assessment
2850547 who dares wins and they have exceptional initiative exceptional skill exceptional courage and i think just exceptional savvy i cant say enough about them actually about how impressive they are in just thinking on their feet
2850548 we have had many many cases of very important operations they have helped immensely in the baghdad area in particular to take down the al qaeda car bomb networks and other al qaeda operations in iraqs capital city so they have done a phenomenal job in that regard
2850549 there were iraqi accommodations in basra there were coalition accommodations in basra there were deals i was very up front about that in fact when i came through london on the way home from congress in september and noted that thats how you end these kinds of endeavours sometimes the deals work out well and sometimes they dont and when they dont then you have to go back and rectify the situation
2850550 it is an opinion that is still being formulated we are very actively analysing the situation and our various options we are working that pretty intensively we have been reviewing options for several months assessing what the best options are and trying to refine a recommendation to make at an appropriate moment
2850551 the biggest lesson that weve all relearnt and i think we relearn it periodically is that every situation is unique every situation has its own context its own circumstances and the key of course is an accurate and nuanced understanding of the conditions of the situation and then the crafting of an approach that is appropriate for that context within iraq for example what works in ramadi may not work in baquba you have to constantly assess and learn and adapt that approach first of all has to inform what we are doing in afghanistan
2850552 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
2850553 they told us to come out i dont know why but some of our guys are still out there in the fields
2850554 i want to go back if we lose south ossetia now it wont be for ever because we will never surrender our land
2850555 there is a lot of panic many people have left and i am thinking of joining them my bags are already packed
2850556 we are afraid that the russians will come here and kill us people would not go if we had a strong army but they dont believe in our army any more
2850557 i have left everything i dont even have another shirt if the russians stay then i can never return were afraid of what the russians can do
2850558 the russians will be here tomorrow they want to show us and the world how powerful they are tomorrow it will be ukraine and nobody in the west is doing anything to stop them why were our soldiers in kosovo and iraq if we dont get any help from the west now
2850559 we are operating normally nobody has disturbed us at all
2850560 i know that lots of my neighbours are dead i have no idea who is left

2850570 in the morning before the start the hungarians had evolved a strategy to taunt the russians and make the russians angry to distract them from the beginning the match was very physical with kicks and punches being exchanged at one point the hungarian captain dezs gyarmati caught a russian opponent with a sucker punch that was caught on film
2850571 yes sir this the db7 he decapitated himself in the highest bid at the moment is 350 000
2850572 hackers have historically focused devious efforts on computers using windows operating systems because the microsoft software has a horrible security model a registry and hasnt really been updated in 15 years
2850573 the truth is that the mac os is just as vulnerable as microsoft windows
2850574 windows is more secure than you think and mac os x is worse than you ever imagined

2850577 several security researchers have predicted that 2006 will be the year mac os x loses its image as a
2850578 anti virus software firm mcafee has identified mac os x as a growing target for malware attacks
2850579 there will be a significant rise in virus attacks on both the mac and open source platforms according to renowned security expert eugene kaspersky
2850580 after years of relative safety in obscurity the apple mac is becoming an increasingly tempting target for malicious computer hackers according to a new report published this week
2850581 hackers have historically focused devious efforts on computers using windows operating systems because the microsoft software has a horrible security model a registry and hasnt really been updated in 15 years

2850597 most of our brands have been around since the 1800s
2850598 would information about pabsts american ownership on packaging like bottles or cans impact your decision to purchase our products
2850599 buying in the secret dialogue between what we buy and who we are
2850600 it was just there scarce and cheap it had few negative connotations beyond that it was a kind of blank canvas where brand meaning could be filled in by consumers

2850604 we are not going to be ready to do it without the americans

2850629 the presidency of the european union council is deeply concerned by the decision of israeli authorities to approve the construction of 400 housing units in the neve yacov colony and to issue tenders for 286 units in beitar illit and 130 units in har homa
2850630 this decision weakens the credibility of the ongoing diplomatic process
2850631 the presidency of the european union council recalls that the installation of settlements no matter where this takes place in the occupied palestinian territories including east jerusalem is illegal under international law

2850669 teddy as the title of his show suggests lays his innermost thoughts uncomfortably bare for an entire hour a hypersensitive wee lamb he has spent much of the last decade having his heart trampled on by the same cold hearted femme fatale and this show feels like an attempt to achieve some sort of closure at first teddys tales of woe generate more pathos than comedy but stick with him the second half pay off wouldnt be nearly as good without this slow dewy eyed build up

2850671 rather than launch mobileme as a monolithic service we could have launched over the air syncing with iphone to begin with followed by the web applications one by one mail first followed 30 days later if things went well with mail by calendar then 30 days later by contacts
2850672 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
2850673 eddys real specialty is to be able to take what steve asks for implement it hit the target dates make it work and keep the damn thing a secret until steve announces it so you can bet mobileme will get fixed

2850724 you cant really look at what we dont have you have to look at what we do have and the guys that we do have can produce

2850736 i thought ive done well ill find out what they think after they watch the films
2850737 dont let anyone touch him hes a lot more important than i am
2850738 for the center the big thing is you have to snap the ball and make the calls but its all using your hands staying square and being physical snapping with the nose guard on top of you is tough
2850739 i have high expectations for our defensive football team the bar has been set pretty high so im pretty picky with them they know it so when a player or group doesnt perform to that absolute level hes capable of performing then im going to talk about it with him
2850740 im the sixth from the top you have that many heads in the household it definitely teaches you patience and you know you have to wait your turn sometimes
2850741 but you have to stay positive because whenever your opportunity arises you have to step up to it
2850742 ive been in seattle for six years playing behind shaun
2850743 if thats not patience i dont know what it is i definitely think its the opportunity now i just need to take advantage of it and do everything i can to help this team win

2850747 me going to school the last like two years was kind of a nonexistent thing i was doing what they was going which wasnt the right thing
2850748 since oregon i kind of looked like this is my last chance to recover and accomplish what i want to accomplish in football i made mistakes in high school i wasnt going to make any more mistakes like that again
2850749 its a very significant pull i dont know if well see willie again the rest of this year
2850750 willie plays so hard that if you get him back you know hes going to go hard so you have to make sure the thing is absolutely 100 percent healthy before you bring him back because hell pull it again we want to let him get strong again
2850751 willie is a jack of all trades you can put him anywhere on the field hes a nice weapon to have were going to miss him
2850752 you are the totaliter aliter the vestigious trinitatum who speaks to us in the modality of christo monism
2850753 you are he who heals our ambiguities and overcomes the split of angst and existential estrangement you are he who speaks of the theonomous viewpoint of the analogia entis the analogy of our being and the ground of all possibilities
2850754 you are the impossible possibility who brings to us your children of light and children of darkness the overwhelming oughtness in the midst of our fraught condition of estrangement and brokenness in the contiguity and existential anxieties of our ontological relationships
2850755 nearly all men can stand adversity but if you want to test a mans character give him power

2850757 this is a big wake up call for mr rudd
2850758 this is an extraordinary swing and it underlines the disillusionment australians are seeing and feeling with the lack of leadership from the new federal labor government a government that promised so much
2850759 last year kevin 07 was everywhere dripping with empathy draping himself across petrol station forecourts shopping centre aisles promising to stop prices going up

2850761 i dont think that we can construe from the northern territory some grand lessons for western australia
2850762 obviously were going to wait and see the results to be finalised during the course of this week
2850763 obviously generally the public says to politicians they want them to serve their term and get the job done but circumstances can bring early elections on and thats whats happened in western australia
2850764 nevertheless when elections come and go theres always a lesson for politicians in them i think the lesson from this election as prime minister kevin rudd has said and its a lesson for all politicians is youve always got to be in touch with the electorate and cant take anything for granted
2850765 this is a big wake up call for mr rudd
2850766 well dear mosadegh seem to have messed up the brits plans here as you know people are busy with the election the feasts are on a while back it was eisenhowers birthday were doomed if he wins everyone goes eats and signs up to vote comes election time they just have to sign all are wearing pins either stevenson or ike and this itself is a form of propaganda trueman who is a democrat and wants stevenson to win has recently exposed the republicans corruption files on the radio and tv they constantly talk about new files by the way they are refuting the charges eisenhower rejected teh charges on tv and explained that he has earned his wealth from selling his book also nixon who wants to be the vp has shown his life in tv and has given a big speech also the eisenhower supporters are very critical of trueman and blame him for the corruption of the cabinet subordination to the british and large government spendings right now this is a verbal attack market but not abusive like in iran here they swear with documents and witnesses anyways it is almost the same everywhere in the world
2850767 our stance would not change with sanctions or the threat of sanctions

2850840 the patients love it we give them a pack developed with healthcare professionals which gives them quite a lot of information about what their condition is about and what they can do about it
2850841 we remind them about the importance of keeping warm the temperature to keep their room at exercising trying to avoid the low temperatures and seeking medical advice at an early stage
2850842 with a small adjustment to their lives in the run up to the cold weather they can significantly reduce the likelihood of their getting poorly
2850843 it helps the patients meaning they do not spend time going in and out of hospital
2850844 overall it has been fairly successful and patients are hoping it will keep going
2850845 the patients last year were contacted two or three times
2850846 this has helped the practice as well as the patients the patients are aware there is a three week period after the cold snap when they are at most risk and are more vigilant
2850847 we are more vigilant too and we know we may expect more patients

2850858 saakashvili an apparently quite idealistic 40 year old former ny lawyer seems to have erred too much in thinking that giddy summitry with western big wigs might pay dividends but unfortunately insufficiently appreciated the disastrous waning in u s power these past years despite his constant hankering for nato membership and thus has fallen short with regard to better appreciating a variable which would have been more apropos namely a harsh dose of realpolitik

2850867 the problem is that there is nothing preventing wasps from just billing a number out of the blue there are rules and an industry watchdog waspa but the rules are generally not enforced
2850868 when a cellular user complains about being billed for content they never asked to receive wasps typically refund them generally after a struggle and the complaint goes away juicy profits are made because countless users never notice the subtraction of these small amounts or simply dont know how to go about complaining
2850869 should a subscriber find any unauthorised wasp charges on their bills they should contact their mobile service provider to find out who is charging them for these services
2850870 it is the companys policy to be completely transparent with regards to its charging plans and at all times ensures that it is acting in a responsible manner when it markets its business
2850871 we do not have any consumer facing products so we dont bill anyone it is our clients who offer these services and bill the subscribers
2850872 in cases of the recycled sims we do investigate those complaints in detail we ask for proof of date of purchase and thereafter if we find that it is a recycled sim we then provide with a refund
2850873 in the case of monthly billed subscription services after the initial lack of funds response from mtn the wasp will only be permitted to re submit 24 hours after the first request should this re submit get a lack of funds response from mtn the wasp will be allowed to re submit the request 30 days later
2850874 should this last request receive a lack of funds response from mtn the wasp will be required to cancel the subscription services on the wasps systems against the service users msisdn

2850957 on that form he is the best central defender in the world by far
2850958 he intercepted every ball broke out of defence with real comfort and gave a magnificent performance
2850959 all that potential has been fulfilled and we are now seeing the very best of him
2850960 i respect all the other candidates for the england captaincy but rio is the best defender in the country right now
2850961 it would be great for rio and great for the club if he was to become england captain it would be well deserved

2850971 his failure to turn on vehicle lighting or use a reflecting device as a warning sign
2850972 ups drivers are trained to map their routes to turn right whenever possible
2850973 it saves fuel and reduces emissions by minimizing the length of time our trucks are idling and its safer too because you dont have to cross traffic
2850974 dont wait for for someone else to make a change go out and make a change
2850975 if this keeps on im going to blow my brains out please give me whatever advice you can
2850976 since trajectory isnt important here our recommendation would be a 35 remington with 200 grain soft nose bullet
2850977 goodyear did an excellent job im their biggest critic at times they can do things right at times you still got to see the race you get to see guys who are a lot out of their element and thats fun its fun to watch those drivers adapt
2850978 i figure with the cup deal closing down i might as well be in the car somewhere
2850979 i was planning to do these nationwide races anyway i figure get in the car keep learning keep working on how to drive a stock car properly thats where we are now
2850980 im going to talk to other teams in the nascar paddock for sure
2850981 im going to talk to everybody and see what my options are for next year
2850982 its not a good feeling its the first time its happened in my career
2850983 on restarts these tires are pretty slick we found that out at infineon just planning for that and trying to get a good solid run up off the corner and being able to get up through the ss helped out the more we ran the better our car got with grip that was definitely something we could capitalize on too
2850984 i could never get close enough to pass him unfortunately
2850985 i could never get the runs in the right spots
2850986 there were corners we were better than him just not in the right spots we could never get close enough to get an opportunity like marcus said you can dive bomb a guy and probably make something happen but that wasnt the right way we never really close enough to make it right
2850987 i thought yesterday was great but when i would up there on that red flag i realized where i was
2850988 so i just tried to stay clean as best i could and pass cars cleanly and just pick away at it i really had no idea where i was until the last pit stops when we cycled through about sixth place im so proud of the wood brothers giving me a piece that i could really get out there and give it my best
2850989 i was happy we had a good car and we learned a lot at the saturday nationwide race
2850990 i lost a lot of foot brakes as the race got going and the car got real tight the splitter was on the ground a little bit too much but that did foil our strategy
2850991 my team worked really hard we had a good car we were fast in practice lead some of the race just ran out of car strategy got messed up there at the end we should have done something different but i dont know
2850992 we probably lost about 15 seconds on that probably 20 seconds total because there were guys coming in to pit earlier and we needed to pit
2850993 steve crew chief letarte was trying to tell me to pit and i had no idea
2850994 we just had a loose connection and finally they black flagged me but even when i was out there i was trying to fix it and i lost even more time doing that we finally got in there and shoot we came out and we were like 30th the car was a struggle already and the last thing we needed was to lose that much track position
2850995 its the type of track i have a little experience at
2850996 i tested there once in a busch east car i think it would be cool if we do that ill get both races sprint and nationwide in well just have to see it definitely would be fun
2850997 i kind of like the bigger tracks a little bit more than the short tracks nashvilles pretty cool kentuckys cool i kind of have more fun with those i like something new to me and thats sort of why i like them a little bit more to be honest its two different types of racing theyre both fun racings racing

2851040 clearly there have been incidents on both sides but this is obviously a planned georgian operation a contingency plan they have had for some time to retake south ossetias capital tskhinvali
2851041 possibly the georgians calculated that with putin in beijing they could recapture the capital in two days and then defend it over the next two months because the russians wont take this lying down
2851042 russia should not be blamed for the fighting but russia should now be pressured not to go beyond its peacekeeping mandate and to ensure that armed militia do not cross the border into south ossetia
2851043 this pushed georgia into a philosophy of self reliance the idea that georgia will be able to regain breakaway entities only by its own means

2851107 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2851108 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2851109 this is supposed to be the democrats year of destiny bush is hobbling out of office the economy is in the toilet voters are sick of the war and the party s wunderkind candidate is raking in money hand over fist so why is the presidential race a statistical dead heat the pundits have offered a host of reasons but one in particular deserves more exploration racism barack obama s candidacy has shed some light on the extremes of racism in america how much has dissipated especially among younger people and how much remains according to a july new york times cbs news poll when whites were asked whether they would be willing to vote for a black candidate 5 percent confessed that they would not that s not so bad right but wait the pollsters then rephrased the question to get a more accurate portrait of the sentiment they asked the same whites if most of the people they knew would vote for a black candidate nineteen percent said that those they knew would not depending on how many people they know and how well they know them this universe of voters could be substantial that s bad welcome to the murky world of modern racism where most of the open animus has been replaced by a shadowy bias that is difficult to measure as obama gently put it in his race speech today s racial resentments aren t always expressed in polite company however they can be and possibly will be expressed in the privacy of the voting booth
2851110 over those 350 years harlem has evolved into the mecca of the african diaspora and despite many ups and downs it is still going strong
2851111 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2851112 you have to get focused and give it a go
2851113 but i guess thats the way things go sometimes the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2851114 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2851115 ironically our biggest advance this year was with a plane that didnt fly
2851116 next year well be emphasizing fuel efficiency as the ultimate goal with planes that maintain the characteristics of practical aircraft
2851117 the push to develop a diesel engine is worthy because of the limited availability of aviation leaded fuels

2851128 our parting is amicable and both of us still care about each other very much
2851129 hes coming through the door oh god ive got about one minute before i die please get to me
2851130 done with honesty and genuine commitment there must be a chance that they will raise the consciousness of those involved in protecting the public
2851131 beyond that the review might drive innovation in the services offered so that more people in need make contact in the first place including perpetrators and it might contribute to greater community involvement and give impetus to education of youngsters about warning signs and how to have healthy relationships
2851132 the inspiration came from a number of clients coming forward to norwich mind needing help with domestic matters but at the time we didnt have the funding to fully go out there and support everyone
2851133 we decided to apply for funding and in june we got a grant of 10 000 from awards for all which we will spend on complementary therapy including head massage and reiki life coaching workshops for building self esteem self defence and domestic violence awareness lot of people dont realise the scope of domestic violence it doesnt necessarily have to be a partner it can be a parent sibling or even your child abusing you
2851134 we hope that women will come forward every single case will be dealt with in the strictest of confidence
2851135 my husband was very horrible to me and called me names
2851136 there are quite a few foreigners living in norwich who are here because of marriage
2851137 they do not know where they can go for help and support even groups like mother and baby groups dont feel so welcoming as there is a language barrier and in a different country the mentality is different and everything is different
2851138 some women might want to go back home but have no money and if there are children involved then the woman would either have to leave her children in england or prove to the courts that they would have an equal or better life abroad which is very difficult
2851139 all these things are offered at a womans own pace and when a woman comes to use she gets a confidential service and we will be there for her
2851140 every decision she makes will be her own decision but there is always someone available for her to talk to
2851141 all our staff are suicide awareness trained because we recognise that most women who come to us have or have had suicidal thoughts because of the domestic violence and we offer a 24 hour service 365 days a year
2851142 i would like to say that we have a very successful partnership protocol in relation to domestic violence which has increased the confidence of victims to come forward and not suffer in silence
2851143 our recorded incidents of domestic violence are now more accurate and we are seeing a reduction in the number of incidents reported to police after a initial increase when the protocol was introduced
2851144 the service we and partner agencies provide to victims has improved significantly over the past number of years
2851145 clearly there are victims out there who are not coming forward and in this regard there is still a lot of work to do
2851146 broadband consumers would be able to purchase music files straight from the isps or subscribe to protected music libraries and even allow isps to create their own download service like itunes but without a heavy initial outlay by acting a one stop shop the big music studios will not be compelled to discuss individually with the dozens of isps out there leaving that to 7digital
2851147 we are committed to improving the way we deal with rape and domestic violence cases which are among the most serious crimes we deal with
2851148 the rape and domestic violence policies are an important part of the cps violence against women strategy which sets out how we deal with crimes of violence against women these crimes not only have a devasting impact on the victims but on their friends and families as well
2851149 revising our policies means we make sure they are current and relevant they set out for victims their families witnesses and the general public what they can expect from the cps and that our aim is to prosecute cases effectively we welcome the views of the public to help us achieve this
2851150 i am proud that we have achieved a step change in the way we address domestic violence over recent years and the cps has played a pioneering role in this area
2851151 there is much more to do but we are succeeding in reducing the prevalence of domestic violence and the number of related homicides the increase in successful convictions up to 70 per cent is a significant improvement against the background of an increasing volume of prosecutions
2851152 rape is an appalling crime we are consulting on this policy in keeping with the significant steps taken by the government to improve justice for complainants
2851153 victim care is now managed by dedicated units pre trial witness interviews are available and improved special measures ensure that a witness can give their evidence at its best

2851158 at this time there isnt any new information available for this issue i have checked with engineering and the issue is still being investigated
2851159 posts 9 from switzerland registered apr 5 2006 have you filed the bug about the new macbookpro 2 2ghz santa rose chipset with the nvidia geforce 8600m gt graphic card or about an older macbookpro with an ati graphic card i also made a bug report about the new macbookpro 2 2ghz santa rose chipset with the nvidia geforce 8600m gt graphic card the bug id is 5727589 posts 6 from italy registered nov 8 2007 same problem here i have a mbp 17
2851160 i called apple and they suggested that i do an archive amp install and then not install the leopard graphics update
2851161 weve actually now received confirmation from apple that this is caused by a bug in one of their drivers
2851162 weve actually now received confirmation from apple that this is caused by a bug in one of their drivers theres nothing more that microsoft can do about this issue apple is working on a fix i cant speak for them as to when they will release an update that fixes the problem
2851163 on apples darwin kernel list another developer reported that everything with his hba driver was fine until leopard build 9a559 the last one handed out to developers
2851164 getting started booklet however front row was still installed and the bug was exacly the same
2851165 together with the donsk ja icon of our lady of the don river just as the vlad mirskaja is the icon of our lady of vlad mir
2851166 you know i wouldnt dream of doing this unless i absolutely had to but this ones kind of important
2851167 whats going on nothing more in the way of the destruction of all existence area i hope
2851168 no nothing like that we just need you to stop a world war
2851169 nice odds the dri or the welbornian couldnt handle this
2851170 sure if they have enough time but considering whats at stake they want to make sure this is done right as quickly as possible
2851171 of course its all right everything i say is all right as long as chris is all right too
2851172 zach how about you go to the bar and get yourself anything you like
2851173 as zach walked toward the bar i heard him call out happily to the bartender
2851174 when were you guys planning on telling me that young zachary has never been in the field before
2851175 how how in the world did you know i was out here
2851176 considering all that weve been through over the years frank im actually offended that you asked me that but i forgive you because thats the kind of person i am what did you lose
2851177 no i want to know how did you know i was out here
2851178 my wife wants me to stop a world war and pretty much the entire house of bishops is standing in front of me wetting their chasubles in fear so i just put two and two together now what did you lose
2851179 but how did you know that i was involved in
2851180 the vladimir icon the vladimirskaya the theotokos of vladimir you finally did it frank you finally punched a hole through the stupidity ceiling
2851181 certainly the single most important piece of russian orthodox art there is
2851182 it was supposed to have seen off a mongol horde or two it protected moscow from the tender mercies of tamerlane stalin had it flown around moscow as the nazis approached and the germans never got there im going to stick my neck out here and say yes
2851183 lets say it was stolen by some radical muslim group maybe they declare it an act of jihad against christians they film themselves laughing while theyre destroying it and post the thing on youtube what happens
2851184 bye bye chechnya bye bye any other russian muslims there happen to me maybe china expresses its sympathies with russia and uses the excuse to put more wood to xinjiang
2851185 that the bulgarians the macedonians the montenegrins and the greeks decide that the serbs were right about the bosnians and muslim albanians the first time so with russian help they go in and finish the job and nobody in the west wants to save bosnians and albanians this time
2851186 along with complete oil embargoes withdrawal of funds from western banks that kind of thing
2851187 so if they dont kill us theyll drive the price of oil off the charts and or destroy any western economies they can
2851188 and when everything collapses everywhere they march in pick up the pieces and those female episcopal bishops over there turn in their crosiers and their car keys and get fitted for burqas
2851189 calm down frank ive had lots of experience cleaning up your messes lets start at the beginning where was it stolen from
2851190 were going to have a special joint episcopal orthodox service there commemorating our long relationship
2851191 no seriously frank what did you really tell them the russian orthodox church doesnt even think you guys are christians anymore
2851192 we just wanted to display it in america and we felt that st louis was a good central location so that everyone would have a chance to see it
2851193 is there some kind of committee thats handling details on this end
2851194 i wonder why the russians didnt just take this thing on tour
2851195 they did ask us to come in as security consultants and they did listen to us
2851196 amy and i went to moscow and personally accompanied it here
2851197 cameras covering all the hallways and outside all the windows the room was guarded 24 7 they couldnt have done it any better
2851198 one of the guards he looked in and saw that it wasnt there
2851199 its still guarded and filmed 24 7 nobodys been inside since we sealed it off pending your arrival
2851200 none whatsoever only thing i know about this case kid is that theres one thing that were not going to be anywhere close to short of
2851201 together with the donsk ja icon of our lady of the don river just as the vlad mirskaja is the icon of our lady of vlad mir
2851202 before her dog booger was cloned it was treated at a newland north carolina veterinary clinic but miss mckinney was so erratic as a client that she had been banned by at least two local vets
2851203 kevin frye said that ms mckinney had not lived in avery county north carolina since he became sheriff at the end of 2006 however she had a record that included an arrest on july 14 2004 for communicating threats and cruelty to animals
2851204 the former miss wyoming who drew headlines after mortgaging her home to have her dead dog cloned was outed by a british newspaper yesterday as the same woman who 30 years ago fled england after being charged in a bizarre sex crime case
2851205 mckinney thrilled british tabloid readers in 1978 when she faced charges over kidnapping 64
2851206 i loved him so much that i would ski naked down mt everest with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to
2851207 the pair had a brief affair when they were both studying drama in the us a few years later ms mckinney then 28 tracked mr anderson 21 to ewell in surrey where he had been posted as a missionary and kidnapped him after failing to persuade him to marry her and father her children she donned see through lingerie and forced him to have sex with her reportedly resolutely overcoming his mormon chastity belt he finally escaped and ms mckinney was arrested
2851208 she fled the country using a false passport in 1984 she was arrested near salt lake city airport where kirk anderson was working in her car police found rope and handcuffs
2851209 by the late 1990s joyce mckinney was back in her home state of north carolina dogged by ill health and often in a wheelchair living on benefits in a remote holding with three ponies and a fiercely devoted pit bull called hamburger for company
2851210 it looks like a person it really does i think its a ghost
2851211 he asks me to marry him every day when he wakes up
2851212 has a personal health issue and has had to put the deal on hold
2851213 they had a laugh over the baby rumours but theyre practising with the puppy first
2851214 hey hes an enemy combatant so we can keep him in jail until the war on terror ends
2851215 there were some disappointing things but again there were some individual performances you can build on
2851216 some of the things that we had problems with were things carolina did that we dont practice a lot i can see where we need some work on certain things
2851217 we were overrunning some things we dont blitz ourselves a lot weve got to get some more work on that the next two weeks obviously
2851218 we had a little bit of trouble with the running game we hadnt had a long time to work on that and game plan for them theyre easily correctable things we didnt pressure the passer as well as we did in the first game
2851219 i thought our second group came in and got us back in the game
2851220 you dont like to have two turnovers early in the game
2851221 we had a couple of chances they were disappointed about that jim did fine had we worked on some of their blitzes a little more we might have had a little more opportunity
2851222 they did a good job and went in there and played hard
2851223 i thought our coverage units covered well we had a couple of kickoff returns inside the 20 punter hunter smith and kicker adam vinatieri kicked well cornerback t j rushing returned well for us
2851224 theyre doing fine theyre a group that played a little better this week
2851225 you want to see how guys play and the system just has to take care of certain things that the other team does
2851226 we werent as sharp as we needed to be saturday i think we need one more week of that in terms of just working our fundamentals and getting our assignments down and getting better
2851227 the lack of adequate hostel provision and the shocking increase in waiting lists for social housing reflect the failure of the state to understand this complex problem it is alarming that the most vulnerable women are faced with the unenviable choice of squatting sleeping rough or relying on family or friends for accommodation a big part of this problem stems from labours failure to build enough housing in every category over the last decade
2851228 this report underestimates the true numbers because it only includes those accepted by councils as a priority many vulnerable women escaping domestic violence lie low and stay away from councils altogether so are not counted those who ask for help are not always accepted as a priority and dont make any lists this is a largely hidden problem which these numbers only touch upon
2851229 councils have to take more responsibility for these vulnerable people yes we need more houses but the government has to be more creative with the private sector if we are ever going to meet housing needs
2851230 it has been virtually impossible for councils to build new homes because they cant borrow money on the open market
2851231 last year was the first time since 1983 that we built more social houses than were lost through right to buy our recent housing bill and the creation of the homes and communities agency will help to deliver council homes more quickly and will make it easier for councils to build their own social housing to meet the needs

2851242 there are several other steps that are required to commercialize the material but were cautiously optimistic that these steps can be carried out successfully

2851258 imagine if christians were commonly denied custody of their own children by judges who declared that attendance at christian churches and maintaining a christian education were contrary to the childrens best interests the outcry against such a violation of basic liberties would be incredible and the christians would be right to be so upset

2851298 when drivers type in their most common routes theyre shocked how much blood is being shed on it when its the route you or your loved ones use the need to buckle up slow down and avoid distractions and drinking suddenly becomes much more personal and urgent
2851299 by mapping out these fatalities we can visually see what a large problem we have in our country it is time to start working toward prevention and each one of these dots on the map represents that
2851300 its essential that the world know that xdr tb is not a death sentence as or even more importantly our study shows that effective treatment does not require hospitalization or indefinite confinement of patients
2851301 to do drug tests we need to have cancer cells in cultures we take the cancer cells add the targeted therapy drug agent and show whether it can kill or not kill
2851302 while many medical blogs provide valuable information to the public are respectful in tone and are written anonymously others pose a threat to patient privacy and have the potential to threaten the integrity of the medical profession
2851303 unfortunately no professional organization has taken the initiative to provide guidance on this issue as the number of medical blogs grows professional organizations medical educators and the blogging community must address the challenge of this new medium by setting guidelines and standards for what is appropriate
2851304 the leaders we have while theyre the worst that weve had are hardly the worst this poor world has seen

2851309 im just sick of the doomsday people who say that if we dont act tomorrow we will be dead by next week
2851310 all the people i dealt with in that role that were convinced about the extent of mans contribution to climate change are probably a little too convinced
2851311 but saying that i dont blame the scientists because theyve had their information picked up by people who have blown the issue out of context because they see this as their political lifeline
2851312 i have a great respect for the instincts of people who live in the elements and i dont see any old bushmen or farmers panicking just yet
2851313 i am shocked we have lost not only an incredible talent but a wonderful leader to his community and a dear friend to me there will only be one isaac hayes gifting us with years of performing writing and a voice that penetrated deep into our souls he is to be admired for changing his life around and standing steadfast to his beliefs his integrity and to helping others my heart goes out to his family his wife adjowa and his beloved children and to those who loved him for just being him isaac you will be missed but never forgotten
2851314 isaac was one of the more genuine and beautiful souls i have had the privilege to cross paths with and befriend in this life he was an incredible friend this is a tragic loss my heart goes out to his wife and children wherever he is going to just became a brighter and more beautiful place and i will miss him dearly
2851315 i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis around the world
2851316 i dont suffer from mental instability i enjoy every minute of it
2851317 i dont suffer from mental instability i enjoy every minute of it
2851318 i dont suffer from mental instability i enjoy every minute of it
2851319 the ownership of money and property comes as a result of doing things in a certain way those who do things in this certain way whether on purpose or accidentally get rich those who do not do things in this certain way no matter how hard they work or how able they are remain poor it is a natural law that like causes always produce like effects therefore any man or woman who learns to do things in this certain way will infallibly get rich
2851320 i can honestly say that since that first night when a tattered printed manuscript found its way to me thanks to one of my daughters my life has never been the same once you read it for yourself you will understand why
2851321 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
2851322 i think we dont want to make too much of his promises on taxes
2851323 once the republicans are vanquished i wouldnt hold your breath waiting for that capital gains tax hike
2851324 als iedereen zich zo goed zou voelen als ik dan zouden de ziekenhuizen leeg zijn
2851325 if you critical on this melee attack roll a magical attack of four dice
2851326 the truth or falsity of moral judgments or their justification is not absolute or universal but is relative to the traditions convictions or practices of a group of persons
2851327 however much we dislike it we are again and again forced to recognise that there are no truly absolute values whatever not even human life itself
2851328 the conservative is generally happy to cling to his belief in absolute values while i envy him i cannot share his beliefs
2851329 a hallmark of a genuinely liberal non utopian cast of mind
2851330 a handful of votes in a handful of seats will determine the outcome of this election and im fighting very hard to hold each and every of the 19 seats we have

2851332 by proving their capabilities distance learners have shown that they are in no way inferior to students of regular formal institutions
2851333 as many as 95 per cent universities in developed countries offer open and distance learning
2851334 the council maintains the standards and organises the activities of distance learning it ensures that the quality of teaching is maintained in all universities
2851335 the quality of teaching is on a par with and the assessment is as stringent as in any regular institution students should not regard this system of learning as a cakewalk
2851336 with no peer pressure and external factors forcing a student to keep his nose to the grind every day he can get lazy and leave things for the last minute so a disciplined approach is essential
2851337 during the last decade distance learning has evolved phenomenally to bridge physical distances internet and mobile technology are now used to support learning
2851338 pursuing graduation through correspondence helped me utilise my three years for picking up various diploma courses today i am employed while my peers are still studying
2851339 distance education from a good open university is better than mediocre universities or private universities as long as the employer is aware of the reputation of the open university one need not worry
2851340 the need of the hour is to advertise their course content to employers through placement services
2851341 after having led a protected life in school children now need to learn to be independent and interact with a cross section of people this can happen only when they go to a regular college
2851342 pursuing a certificate or diploma course from an institute will give them an added edge since they will be attending classes daily it will also shape their personality
2851343 unless they have some valuable work experience we try not to appoint students who pursue education through open universities
2851344 students who pursue education through distance learning cant be termed less ambitious most of them have their own reasons for choosing a distance education option and the mode of education should not be the deciding factor for recruiters

2851374 there needs to be international mediation for the south ossetia issue
2851375 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2851376 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2851377 president saakashvili briefed the vice president on the russian campaign against military and civilian targets throughout georgia

2851433 david broder is this a 3 a m moment for foreign policy for these candidates
2851434 senator would you meet with assuming mr putin is elected in march would you want to meet with him as a candidate other candidates have gone overseas while running for office or right before the campaign begins
2851435 im not sure that would be necessary might be an interesting experience because i know whats going on in russia so do a whole lot of my friends well we know he was a apparatchik we know he was a member of the kgb we know that he came to power because of the military brutality and massacre that is taking place in russia today i mean in chechnya today we know that he worked a deal with yeltsin so that yeltsin would have immunity and he would be assured the presidency rather than basically a contested im very concerned about mr putin im afraid mr putin might be one of those who wants to make the trains run on time so yeah i would meet with him as a candidate but i think that what i would really like to do is send a message to mr putin that we expect certain behavior out of the russians and particularly whats going on in chechnya today a cessation of that brutality and that its a very important strategic part of the world for us
2851436 ive been so fortunate to be a part of such an amazing community wide giving spirit in the five years since las vegas has been my home
2851437 its truly an honor to continue that tradition with this benefit concert for the center

2851439 we always welcome rock legends at tiger jam and having bon jovi headline is truly an honor we have a lot to celebrate so i know it will be an amazing night
2851440 i am amazed at what tiger has accomplished in such a short time and am looking forward to joining in this celebration with a fantastic rock show
2851441 i love all the people at harrahs the theater is beautiful and the audiences have been fantastic when they say ive been extended does that mean im taller
2851442 rita has been an absolute home run for us from her very first performance

2851445 we are honored to have jenny mccarthy as our first celebrity bunny dealer she is an icon and great representative of the playboy brand and i couldnt think of a more perfect fit
2851446 ive spent 15 years creating and evolving a concept that the world of entertainment has never seen
2851447 now im thrilled to be working with cirque du soleil and felix rappaport and his amazing team here at the to create an experience that goes beyond even my wildest expectations
2851448 this production represents a new distinctive type of creation for
2851449 we were listening to the unc radio station there and they were playing an r
2851450 ya that was r e m the sound of the new south
2851451 no 1 pastime drinking if you dont like alcohol go to another school
2851452 with those bills and the tuition coming due and hanging over your head it does put you in a bit of a panic
2851453 only to find out the lenders theyve chosen are no longer going to be offering loans this fall
2851454 some of these rates have no caps which means if interest rates rise you could be up to paying 15 to 18 percent on these loans
2851455 you know when he comes out so its very scary
2851456 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2851457 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2851458 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2851459 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2851460 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2851461 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2851462 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2851463 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2851464 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2851465 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2851466 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2851467 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2851468 we hope that there is no further bloodshed there has been too much bloodshed already
2851469 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2851470 it has to be condemned and the world needs to stand against it
2851471 app is widely considered the worst fibre manufacturer in the world
2851472 it leaves open the possibility that as soon as they think the coast is clear they will go back to selling unsustainable product made by asia pulp amp paper
2851473 it will not deal with the many satellites of asia pulp amp paper to assist them to launder illegal or unsustainable timber by routing it through different operations and countries
2851474 transparency is the only way for woolworths to demonstrate that it is genuine in its sustainability intentions and after so much pressure its the least consumers and shareholders should expect
2851475 were investigating the situation now and until we find out further information were not going to make a statement into regards to paul and kenny being in our program
2851476 i was called in to the dean of student affairs on thursday and informed that i would be expelled if a sit in was held
2851477 the administration knew that i was a sit in organizer and said they would expel me if anything occurred
2851478 lack of discussion could mean that people are fine with how things are now besides you
2851479 whether it will be funding or graduation rates we are still separate and unequal
2851480 right now we rank 49 out of 50 in funding education from the state thats a travesty
2851481 so with her having no challenge she dont struggle as hard as she used when she was being educated in the south
2851482 i think its important that the public schools get the same equal that the suburban schools does
2851483 i respect and agree with reverend meeks goal to increase education funding to that end i have called the legislature back into special session on tuesday to focus specifically on school funding but i think its wrong to encourage kids to miss school every time a child misses a day in school that child misses a chance to learn
2851484 dream as if youll live forever live as if youll die today

2851492 one unlucky guy tried to disrupt a panel but once he opened his mouth he was
2851493 george is pro palestinian and he is also urging barack to withdraw unconditionally from iraq if he wins
2851494 his hope of becoming americas first black president depends heavily on winning over conservative voters and it would be suicidal for him to be perceived as a tool of a hollywood leftie which is how they regard george
2851495 slept with too many women done too many drugs and been to too many parties
2851496 george is a master at crafting his own image and he is helping obama to hone his image both domestically and abroad
2851497 he has tried to keep the true extent of their involvement out of the press because he is frightened of alienating voters
2851498 the palestinian leadership has been working on establishing a palestinian state within the 67 borders
2851499 if israel continues to oppose making this a reality then the palestinian demand for the and its leadership would be one state a binational state
2851500 he translated the pain of the palestinians in a magical way he made us cry and made us happy and shook our emotions
2851501 apart from being the poet of the palestinian wound which is hurting all arabs and all honest people in the world he is a master poet
2851502 this great figure whose poetry which reflects nostalgia and liberty speaks to us all
2851503 mahmoud darwish knew how to express the attachment of an entire people to its land and the absolute desire for peace his message which calls for will continue to resonate and will eventually be heard
2851504 when i was in jail i read some of his poems
2851505 the palestinian question in mahmoud darwishs poetry was no longer a legend but the story of people made of flesh blood and feelings
2851506 the voice of palestinian civilisation with its pains sadness and ambitions
2851507 with him gone the palestinians and all arabs will be missing one of the poetic and cultural symbols in the modern history
2851508 he turned the palestinian cause into songs that transcended the cause and all other arab issues
2851509 today i have come bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighters gun do not let the olive branch fall from my hand
2851510 before anything mahmoud darwish was a great poet who possessed real poetic power
2851511 he quickly became the national palestinian poet the poet of the exile and of the refugees

2851519 it was so cold i kept trying to hold the baby back
2851520 we had nothing to wrap her in so i put her in my jacket but the water was all under me
2851521 they said if you dont get out of here we will shoot you
2851522 afterwards i learned that maybe if i had stayed sitting there in that position the boy could have suffocated to death
2851523 there was no nurse like when i gave birth to the first one
2851524 my water broke as i walked through and everyone was staring
2851525 you have the kids with you and its slow and you have to wait in line
2851526 i had grapes plums apricots almonds on the other side of the fence
2851527 they took it away about five years ago they said it was for security
2851528 i used to just prune my trees for a month and a half every year now i get two days access in total
2851529 he and others tried to gain access to the land but he said they were met by armed settlers who turned them away and since then he has become despondent about trying again
2851530 in the last six months not a single request by residents to access their land in the area was denied
2851531 they took away my income when they took my land
2851532 i got the beehives about five months ago and this is the first batch
2851533 i spend my time with the bees i have no land but i have something
2851534 this is a contribution to helping people be self sufficient
2851535 they are in a very vulnerable position because they have lost access to their land have little access to water or have lost their job
2851536 there are lots of rosemary bushes in the settlements and this is good for the honey
2851537 in the winter i want to plant my own rosemary
2851538 we have had lots of water problems in the last three years it wiped us out
2851539 we brought in an expert who found water underground we would have to dig about 30 metres to get the water
2851540 if i had access to the water id invest more in agriculture and give the rest of the water to my neighbours
2851541 we have so many problems but the jews settlers have all the water they want
2851542 but i remember the idea of it you can play in the sun as you please and have your toys but i cant you have a house and i have none you have celebrations but i have none why cant we play together
2851543 if you go on writing such poetry ill stop your father working in the quarry
2851544 i am a poet with a particular perspective on reality
2851545 gaza has won its independence from the west bank one people now have two states two prisons who dont greet each other we are dressed in executioners clothes
2851546 do you think i deserve that if you think i do then i like the idea
2851547 a person can only be born in one place however he may die several times elsewhere in the exiles and prisons and in a homeland transformed by the occupation and oppression into a nightmare poetry is perhaps what teaches us to nurture the charming illusion how to be reborn out of ourselves over and over again and use words to construct a better world a fictitious world that enables us to sign a pact for a permanent and comprehensive peace with life
2851548 she wore a traditional wedding gown while ty wore his favourite blue jeans white shirt and cowboy hat the couple is very happy and look forward to enjoying their honeymoon
2851549 i just think its really a part of your life that you gotta keep to yourself you have to have something sacred to you and the people around you i shared so much of my life i should have something to hold on to
2851550 dave wondered if he could make discs smaller denser and more aerodynamic like an airplane wing
2851551 mostly i play because i like to watch the disc fly
2851552 the basic mechanical skill needed to connect a club with a ball is difficult to achieve
2851553 the basic mechanical skill to throw a disc is easier to achieve
2851554 we just land up on the roof and lay there
2851555 the lost disc that landed furthest out into the lake
2851556 oh all you dumbasses cant say it the way the locals do what hicks
2851557 dyckerson you need to get away from it all you need to break free from the chains of society and find the true meaning of life
2851558 the album i am most proud of in my entire career
2851559 in referring to a character simple jack who is played by mr stiller in a subplot about an actor who chases an oscar by portraying a mindless dolt
2851560 the film was not meant to disparage or harm people with disabilities and that dreamworks expected to work closely with disability groups in the future
2851561 hurry up no waking me up every five minutes today im tired
2851562 e una piccola vittoria per la mia gente ha detto poi nino ai giornalisti se il mondo dovesse trarre una lezione da quello che ho fatto sarebbe che nel mondo non ci dovrebbero essere guerre da nessuna parte
2851563 hanno anche osservato movimenti sul fronte abkhazo di un gran numero di uomini e mezzi militari diretti verso le gole di kodori
2851564 respingere le forze armate georgiane dalla parte superiore delle gole di kodori
2851565 ci si astenga da ulteriori confronti e ritorsioni violente che possono degenerare in un conflitto di pi vasta portata
2851566 mama nog even wachten want het is nog heeeel heet
2851567 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2851568 jai jamais faim pis jai tout le temps soif fait chier je pense jtun d mon
2851569 went to go sit down at the bar and sighed softly thinking about what he she wanted to order
2851570 its not every day we get a movie premiere here
2851571 my family has never experienced anything like this so this is great for them
2851572 its really accessible it deals with things weve all dealt with and continue to deal with and in a place we all know
2851573 weve all been to the mall we all have stories about the mall
2851574 i dont think they ever were not in peoples consciousness i just think theyre popular now with chicago and mamma mia
2851575 i dont know anyone in the world who doesnt have music in their lives
2851576 i hope people dont have any preconceived notions with the success of high school musical
2851577 i am already roasted on one side and so if you want me well cooked then it is time to turn me on the other side
2851578 finished chemotherapy treatment for cancer and has told his family he wants to die at home
2851579 especially in a matter as high profile as this the court was disappointed that much of the testimony particularly as it related to public figures within the state of new jersey and the dirty laundry associated therewith needed to be aired in the public and in the press
2851580 the mcgreeveys clearly had agendas as previously addressed their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
2851581 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances
2851582 try to be like a turtle at ease in your own shell
2851583 we think this is a pretty serious threat and the government guys here weve been talking to agree
2851584 forget about picking and all that other stuff there is nothing abstract about making a plastic key for a lock that isnt yours
2851585 we no longer have that problem with key blanks because you no longer need them
2851586 if you have someone on the inside with access to a key for ten seconds they could compromise the place
2851587 we dont intend to take the initiative to escalate the conflict at this time
2851588 for many years i have warned against russian actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbors
2851589 unfortunately we have seen in recent days russia demonstrate that these concerns were well founded
2851590 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
2851591 the 2008 convention will highlight americans coming together to change the course of this nation
2851592 we are at a critical moment in our nations history
2851593 you just have to take it on and give it a go
2851594 when i started making putts i just stuck in there and it brought my game up the more i got into it the better i played
2851595 i was comfortable with my game in winning the open this week i havent been as confident and comfortable but i knew i had the ability to win if i got a chance
2851596 the first official message ever in which he speaks english
2851597 calls for the people to support jihad in pakistan and lists a litany of grievances against the pakistani government and us involvement there
2851598 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
2851599 also relates his own personal experiences having lived in pakistan in an apparent attempt to build a stronger connection with the pakistani people
2851600 wants to speaks directly to the pakistani people and chose english because he cannot speak urdu
2851601 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances
2851602 it was a wonderful kind of artistic event and the twin towers provided the stage
2851603 i knew the story like many people who live in the city just as an anecdote that you collect or absorb by living here almost like a folk memory
2851604 and the fact that his life well philippe would say it wasnt at stake but everyone else knows that it was
2851605 one of the things that struck me as i made man on wire was that we were sort of re creating a new york that i wished still existed
2851606 its all caught up in the destruction of the twin towers ultimately
2851607 and in fact the new york of 1974 and the world trade center walk is a world id much rather live in i guess theres nostalgia about that which maybe is a dangerous emotion but nostalgia also has a kind of ache to it
2851608 it does bring back and evoke this city that we are in danger of losing completely
2851609 i felt that the choice of not engaging with the destruction of those buildings was essential
2851610 because everybodys going to be engaged with it anyway its the big fact the big documentary fact if you like its the defining fact perhaps
2851611 and the idea for me making the film was to get people not beyond it how could you but at least to a point where you could enjoy the towers being built and you could enjoy this sort of fantasy thats being projected onto them by this obsessed frenchman
2851612 you see the buildings really almost exclusively through his eyes in the film and that then becomes a legitimate way of bringing them back to life i think youre seeing them through someone who knew them knew their secrets and their secret noises because he spent so much time there as they were being finished as they were being built
2851613 if you told it as it was with the people involved you couldnt do any better than that
2851614 its a struggle to be a filmmaker in the u s and ive just given up on it now
2851615 its almost perverse to keep pretending im an american filmmaker
2851616 they knew full well that she had no access to her journalistic work product after they abruptly terminated her
2851617 were going to play on everything good that people know about wysp
2851618 nbc15 will allow me more creativity than i had in philadelphia
2851619 im not sure that amy has the proper image that ben amp jerrys wants to be connected with
2851620 theres this perfectly nice allegedly a 14 year old girl looks to be about 60
2851621 im surprised that he lowered himself to pick on a child and act like a child himself
2851622 yeah they offered me the role but its not really what i see for myself
2851623 there are at least six other famous women pregnant right now who arent getting picked on
2851624 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it
2851625 this cabinet decision is sending a very strong message that as a government and country we are committing ourselves to a low carbon economy
2851626 this statement signals clear recognition by government as a whole that the transformational change required in response to global warming is fully consistent with addressing immediate development needs and inequality within our society
2851627 we are saying to business and society at large that we have to move away from dirty coal as a dominant energy source the longer we wait the more expensive it will become
2851628 the aim is to limit global temperature increases to two degrees above pre industrial levels
2851629 the time is right for the countrys private sector to show leadership by partnering with government to develop a solutions driven national climate change mitigation and adaptation response the cost of inaction far outweighs the cost of mitigating the effects of climate change
2851630 it promises to enable energy producers to boost oil flows from mature reservoirs where billions of barrels of crude lie stranded
2851631 i get rung up once a month or so by mad inventors they came here with various tubes theyd built in their garages we tried the idea out in one or two tanks it seemed to have a very good prospect of escaping two big problems that all wave power devices have to face
2851632 the anaconda can achieve similar resonance by making the speed of the bulge wave the natural speed of the bulge wave in the tube match the speed of the water waves outside
2851633 we could see the first full size device deployed off the uk coast in around five years time
2851634 they have to think very seriously how well this will cope with very large waves which occur now and then
2851635 not fully convinced by his formulae i tried another mathematical approach and discovered to my surprise that the bulge should grow rapidly along the tube running just in front of the wave
2851636 the aim of the project is to generate clean energy and sustainable development in the area
2851637 este parque representa un salto cualitativo en las incursiones del grupo fuera de espa a un salto que viene a reforzar nuestra presencia en latinoam rica y desde luego nuestra apuesta decidida por la expansi n internacional del grupo

2852013 i can see that you do not understand what i am saying to you what i am saying to you is that you do not live life as martin luther lived life you do not wake up in the morning as he did nor do you go to bed at night as he did you need to understand something about changed conditions of belief do you not understand that in the time of martin luther almost every single human being in european civilization woke up afraid that he would die before nightfall eternal destiny was a daily hourly minute by minute thought every night as the late medieval or early reformation human being closed his eyes he feared that he would wake up either in heaven or in hell you do not live with that fear and that means that your understanding of these things is very different from martin luthers thats why he threw ink pots at the devil and you close your notebook and sleep well at night

2852017 weve been in broadcasting for over 45 years so we remember what it was like under the previous regime of the so called fairness doctrine
2852018 what we had to do then would be impossible today
2852019 if someone were to assert that god has ordained marriage as only between a man and woman that would be a controversial statement today
2852020 a newspaper can print a reply or an op ed piece but with broadcasting its fixed its 24 hours that are divisible into so many minutes and if youre devoting them to x you cant devote them to y
2852021 if a broadcaster has to subsidize its opponents and the station is listener funded theyre going to lose a lot of money

2852043 the coin must have been done by a professional the work is impressive
2852044 more apples are showing up on teachers desks and in classrooms
2852045 the cupertino calif computer maker has been aggressively working to reclaim its former ranking as the top supplier of pcs to schools and colleges
2852046 apple lost the education pc sales crown to dell in 1999 according to market research firm idc but in the first quarter this year apple leapfrogged dell in sales of notebook pcs to the u s education market which includes k 12 colleges universities and trade schools it was no 1 with market share of 36 5 while dell slipped to second with 27 1 idc plans to release second quarter data tuesday
2852047 those education market figures dont include apples sales to students in the consumer market where it is even stronger apple like other computer vendors is in the thick of the back to school selling season
2852048 what weve seen over the last couple of years is a significant increase in the number of students who own an apple laptop or apple desktop or plan to buy one said eric weil managing partner of student monitor a market research firm that tracks spending by college students in a spring survey of college students planning to buy notebook pcs this year 43 said they were looking to get apple laptops it was far and away the no 1 brand with almost twice the response rate of no 2 vendor dell which got 22
2852049 apples resurgent mac business is beginning to chip away at the market share of rivals who sell machines running microsofts windows operating system
2852050 the question apple faces now is whether to lower prices to go after even more market share
2852051 apple is widely expected to unveil a new line of notebook computers likely with lower prices in the coming weeks from an overall market perspective there are a ton of windows pc vendors that are quaking in their boots over if apple decides to lower its prices idc analyst richard shim said
2852052 as has been pointed out already apples quality has dropped with the increase
2852053 all the enlightened kids i know are getting gateway or dell laptops running vista
2852054 what does it cost for security software and the time to constantly battle the viruses and worms that plague windows
2852055 as a user for twenty years my experience is there is no quality problem worth mentioning
2852056 thats why only apple fanboys care about the viruses that supposedly
2852057 as has been pointed out already apples quality has dropped with the increase in market share and the rapid pace of recent growth
2852058 there are only so many smug pretentious people willing to pay exorbitant prices for proprietary computers that don t play games

2852067 we found one variant to be associated with weight and lean mass in both ethnic groups this variant was also associated with height total fat mass and hdl cholesterol but only in european american women a different variant was associated with triglyceride levels and hdl cholesterol in african american women
2852068 insects store fat like mammals do as lipid droplets accumulated in the fat body the functional equivalent of both mammalian liver and white adipose tissue
2852069 drosophila share many components of fat biosynthesis degradation and regulation with humans including many of those implicated in diabetes and obesity
2852070 the healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria
2852071 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every millilitre of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth around half of these have yet to be named and we are trying to describe and name the new species
2852072 interestingly this species was isolated from within the oral tissues both in oral cancers and normal healthy tissue
2852073 this confirms other work showing that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells
2852074 amfar is a prestigious organization to get funding from if you do hiv research so its a big testament to the work were doing
2852075 we hope that it will help us reach latinos who are at risk for hiv and improve the outcomes for hiv positive latinos so they are not affected disproportionately
2852076 latinos generally do not go to the doctor to get tested to see if they are infected with hiv until they are very very sick
2852077 and once diagnosed they dont take their medicine as prescribed even when they have access to life extending medicines
2852078 there are a number of different things that are affecting the attitudes and opinions toward medicine of the latino community this study will give us a sense of all the variables that are affecting the trust or mistrust of medicine
2852079 you cant feel the pleasure of the treasure without pressure

2852082 its always pretty fun to be able to walk the dodgers off the field
2852083 for these guys that are in contention theres nothing better than to do that they did it to us in 04
2852084 the intensity that was here in this series and the crowd you could hear them even when we came in after the eighth the sense and feel in the dugout was hey we can do this theyre fighting and thats all you can ask
2852085 its a feeling of if we dont get something started were going to find ourselves in a long september just being so far behind that were not even playing for anything
2852086 we had an opportunity to make something happen with someone in front of us right in our own yard
2852087 were going to have to reach down and reach back its how you come back

2852097 much of the mystery surrounding independent voters has been revealed and the discovery through polls media coverage and intense study of the last two presidential cycles is that independent voters are not that different from partisan voters
2852098 he ticks a lot of the super hero boxes a macho yet slightly camp posture
2852099 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2852100 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2852101 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2852102 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2852103 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2852104 we hope that there is no further bloodshed there has been too much bloodshed already
2852105 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2852106 it has to be condemned and the world needs to stand against it
2852107 they plan to stand with them keep them in prayer and do whatever they can do with these people
2852108 i dont know if we are going to trust another bus to take family members again

2852111 isaac didnt read music but you couldnt believe a guy could sit at a piano and come up with the sounds he did
2852112 when people talk about the memphis sound that was isaac
2852113 they said shaft was a relentless character and it had to denote some kind of action or drama
2852114 meth coffee doesnt glorify methamphetamines any more than richard pryor glorified cocaine
2852115 we have never seen the lake as shallow as this
2852116 its an extreme solution but unless global hydrology changes tomorrow this project is the last hope for the lake
2852117 if rain would ever come we might have a chance
2852118 ive been kind of troubled by how many sharks weve been seeing wondering if this is a phenomenon
2852119 a lot of times when you are throwing the baits in there they dont come in and get it
2852120 they kind of just come over they check you out and then they start working their way in the other direction id be more worried about stepping on a sting ray
2852121 dont wade in the surf or indian river lagoon carrying a stringer of fish with you
2852122 ive seen them aggressive but its been like landing a snook and be standing on the rocks and reaching down to grab the snook and here comes the shark smith said
2852123 they come on real quick so usually youre in the way of what they want to eat thats typical
2852124 they breed in the freshwater tributaries or at the mouths of the freshwater tributaries especially the bullsharks and the blacktip sharks
2852125 this thing was two thirds the length of it boat
2852126 people really are taking liabilities when they are out there up to their waists wading and fishing
2852127 personally i dont know of a human shark interaction which is where a human was actually harmed
2852128 we work in the water were in the water all the time year around were in the water with fish were in the water with these sharks and we have never had any kind of interaction which i would consider remotely negative
2852129 based on memory in the 30 years or so ive been here in florida i cant remember a single incident within the indian river lagoon period regardless of county
2852130 there have been incidents of course in inlets and then you always have the story of trying to figure out whether that constitutes the indian river lagoon or not but its more the oceanic condition
2852131 they are the primary species within the irl system not including inlets
2852132 inlet you can get a larger suite of species because of the link with the oceanic environment
2852133 the population within the irl is consisting of small sharks which are not even close to being full adults
2852134 from our tagging results and from what we examined it can be from half a year up to three years
2852135 definitely as they get to be larger juveniles weve shown at least from what we know they leave and head to offshore waters
2852136 it is an equipment intensive sport in an environment where humans werent necessarily meant to be so there are obviously risks
2852137 statistically its safer than just about anything else there are thousands of people diving off cape ann any given weekend but when someone does die its usually pretty well publicized
2852138 they were on their way out they usually keep an eye on each other and they looked back and saw he was lagging behind
2852139 when they went to see what was going on he was not responsive
2852140 someone will panic manage to make it to the surface and then go back underwater and drown
2852141 a lot of people out there are exerting themselves and they arent used to exercising or wearing a tight fitting wetsuit
2852142 i ll tell you what you tell me what s covered and i ll tell you how it happened
2852143 the closer together the hairs the more pressure the bubble can withstand before collapsing
2852144 we were surprised by the fact that in some cases bugs may be unable to survive in shallow water but we did discover they can safely dive as deep as 30 metres
2852145 the closer together the hairs the more pressure the bubble can withstand before collapsing
2852146 we were surprised by the fact that in some cases bugs may be unable to survive in shallow water but we did discover they can safely dive as deep as 30 metres
2852147 and then turned them up to here i did one the same for little violet you know
2852148 they just come down to me knuckles these do these sleeves
2852149 just pop round one afternoon tom ill do anything me

2852152 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2852153 rock and roll hall of fame was pronounced dead at baptist memorial hospital memphis in memphis tenn after collapsing sunday afternoon near a treadmill in his home nearby
2852154 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2852155 today there seems to be some doubt as to whether any of these curious objects were ever actually constructed
2852156 what makes this particular response so disingenuous is the fact that weiss will cloak himself in self righteousness when its convenient for him i
2852157 i hate those sons of bitches and hope they rot in hell
2852158 i dont know i havent seen him practice yet ask me tomorrow or next week
2852159 now that youve seen them practice what do you think
2852160 that was encouraging the only guy we didnt know if hed go at full speed was will yeatman and he went full speed pretty much the whole day too it was good to see everyone out there and healthy and running around obviously ruben mendoza did a good job because they were in very good shape
2852161 ethan johnson is a guy who looked really good yesterday but hes also running against the third offensive line
2852162 so now all of a sudden you take a guy like ethan johnson and put him against the first offensive line you see if you see a lot of the same things you saw yesterday because yesterday he was in the backfield the whole day
2852163 theres a big difference between a linebacker being 235 and being 210
2852164 go half speed because these guys will screw it up
2852165 tell people you would have been a healthier athlete if you had nice stuff like this
2852166 i feel like were practicing at a bowl game everyday

2852175 one wonders how many posts and comments of a similar nature these people left about saddam hussein during iraqs conflict with america i dont remember seeing many the only winners are anglo saxon arms dealers and mikhal saakachvili himself

2852207 major decisions during her campaign for the democratic presidential nomination would be put off for weeks until suddenly clinton would erupt driving her staff to panic and misfire
2852208 green reports that on a staff conference call in january where clinton received little response or silence to several of her suggestions for how to recover from the iowa loss and do better in new hampshire clinton began to grow angry according to a participants notes green recounts this has been a very instructive call talking to myself she snapped and hung up
2852209 draws on internal memos e mails and meeting notes to reveal what the magazines september issue calls the backstabbing and conflicting strategies that produced an epic meltdown
2852210 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
2852211 is that clinton received a lot of accurate advice including from penn
2852212 but no one synthesized and acted on the good advice
2852213 the anger and toxic obsessions overwhelmed even the most reserved beltway wise men green writes
2852214 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from any specific decision she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make

2852223 rhydian was robbed for the last three minutes his line was blocked and that had not happened before

2852228 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
2852229 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
2852230 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

2852281 weve seen some research that says 60 percent of people who bought a wii fit play it once and dont play it again so we have to get the balance right because what we are doing is bringing new consumers into the market for the first time in their lives sometimes and we have to treat them with respect
2852282 what nintendo have done with the wii is truly fantastic there is no question about it but i think sometimes there is a thin line between gimmick and great gameplay
2852283 one of the things i talk to clients about is that the digital divide has changed
2852284 its no longer along racial lines like it was in 1996 and 2000 now its more economic and educational
2852285 man that would make it real difficult to keep the breathing slow and deep
2852286 well at least the porn videos wouldnt have the awful dialogue and sound effects that the few typical porn videos ive seen included
2852287 ultimately it is optimism and the possibilities of joy we may experience that drives us from day to day
2852288 the things for which we feel importance are never left behind due to being busy otherwise that is where value judgments are made
2852289 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of
2852290 firefox doesnt know how to open this address because the protocol itms isnt associated with any program
2852291 were pretty fortunate there im going to list him as day to day right now if we were in the regular season playing wed push it harder and try to get him back quicker right now well be smart the chances of him playing this week though i would think would be very slim
2852292 its very disappointing after what weve been through and how important he is to the team and how good of a camp hes had
2852293 its kind of deflating in a way today we feel better about it we know were going to get him back
2852294 to be a force to be reckoned with means a lot this year has just been phenomenal its just crazy
2852295 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump
2852296 i never could get the runs in the right spots
2852297 i needed to stay with him to be close enough to try to make a move in a braking zone we never could get close enough to get an opportunity
2852298 i hope i can give the wood brothers a shot in the arm that they need to really get the momentum to move forward
2852299 i knew that he was going to be good we both came in together and left together and that was probably the win right there to be able to beat him off pit road once we did that i kind of got up through the esses better than him and we pulled away
2852300 it was a big hit for a bunch of guys
2852301 we were ready to attack i know with nine to go you get up on the wheel and push hard pushing and shoving is ok but that was crazy i guess there wasnt much place to go they kept pushing and shoving
2852302 i knew getting a good start was going to be good and once i got that then it changed all my worries
2852303 thats hard to do were just trying to pick up the slack it was a good day all the way around
2852304 we said people have to step up today is a prime example that were capable of doing it
2852305 everything i threw was right over the middle of the plate early on especially in the first inning they were sitting on my slider thats definitely not the way i wanted to come back
2852306 its like a broken record getting behind by a lot early
2852307 i cant remember a clean 1 2 3 first inning its been a while it makes for a long day and a long week
2852308 you get behind and you get the ball up and theyre whacking it
2852309 bonds is not a fit for us if he would come i would go i wouldnt want to deal with it
2852310 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2852311 you have to get focused and give it a go
2852312 but i guess thats the way things go sometimes the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2852313 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2852314 i turned to my caddie on 16 and said god this is a lot of fun just to watch
2852315 we talked about how the best thing we could do was try to play volleyball
2852316 im hoping that my age paves the way for other athletes who maybe think theyre too old to do something
2852317 i was only like a half second off my best time so im happy to get my first medal of the olympics
2852318 and all of a sudden its just cold and wet and treacherous
2852319 we came to the olympics with high hopes and expectations
2852320 i believe we were able to achieve this medal because of the people around us who helped us
2852321 i definitely have to say it is an honor to be the lead
2852322 but we are just four races into this and its a long regatta were not even halfway
2852323 he was very good its nice to see him back
2852324 hopefully he got his second wind and he can do what he did in the first half
2852325 they score an awful lot of runs and if you make a mistake they dont foul it off they hit it
2852326 it was a great time for us to start swinging the bats
2852327 we get a day off get fresh legs go to boston and try to catch up that will tell us where we are at at the end of that three game span
2852328 waters was a different pitcher today his location was up
2852329 right out of the gate i wasnt really consistent with my fastball location and in the big leagues youll notice anywhere that if you miss your spots bad things happen
2852330 overall i feel like we obviously didnt play well as a team
2852331 i was disappointed that some of them nonstarters didnt do better
2852332 weve been having a good training camp were excited to come out and play with the confidence weve had so far we have so many veterans when we step on the field we feel confident we should score
2852333 i havent played football in a year so its a little cool i love competing it wont be like this for long
2852334 i just have to work on my tackling i think everything else will come along i did ok guarding people for being out for a little while
2852335 the ged used at jrc was designed because this ones shock was thought to be too
2852336 the ged used at jrc was designed because this ones shock was thought to be too
2852337 arent i clever to come up with this brilliant idea
2852338 a couple more sloweys like this one and i could be in store for a cy young this season
2852339 im well aware of the argument about singling out oil companies rather than soda pop manufacturers
2852340 i think oil companies are amoral they want to make as much money as they can for their shareholders which is what corporations do
2852341 the difference is the nature of the kind of outsized profits they make that may have no relationship to their investments or their production the fact for example the shortage of refinery capacity could actually increase their profits so the less they invest the more they make indicates that you are not dealing with someone making widgets out there
2852342 the lord of the rings the return of the king
2852343 i dont know how long well be able to sustain the gross
2852344 in the fall i do think well have a lot of interest but weve already taken so much out of the marketplace well cross the 500 million bridge around labor day and see where it goes from there
2852345 if i were to try to read much less answer all the attacks made on me this shop might as well be closed for any other business i do the very best i know how the very best i can and i mean to keep doing so until the end if the end brings me out all right whats said against me wont amount to anything if the end brings me out wrong ten angels swearing i was right would make no difference
2852346 those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves and under a just god can not long retain it
2852347 as i would not be a slave so i would not be a master this expresses my idea of democracy whatever differs from this to the extent of the difference is no democracy
2852348 let us have faith that right makes might and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it
2852349 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal
2852350 my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union and is not either to save or to destroy slavery if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that what i do about slavery and the colored race i do because i believe it helps to save the union and what i forbear i forbear because i do not believe it would help to save the union i shall do less whenever i shall believe what i am doing hurts the cause and i shall do more whenever i shall believe doing more will help the cause
2852351 common looking people are the best in the world that is the reason the lord makes so many of them
2852352 i have been driven many times upon my knees by the overwhelming conviction that i had nowhere else to go my own wisdom and that of all about me seemed insufficient for that day
2852353 labor is prior to and independent of capital capital is only the fruit of labor and could never have existed if labor had not first existed labor is the superior of capital and deserves much the higher consideration
2852354 i cannot make it better known than it already is that i strongly favor colonization
2852355 i claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me
2852356 in giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve we shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of earth other means may succeed this could not fail the way is plain peaceful generous just a way which if followed the world will forever applaud and god must forever bless
2852357 with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations
2852358 a house divided against itself cannot stand i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided it will become all one thing or all the other
2852359 i would rather be defeated with this expression house divided against itself cannot stand in the speech and uphold and discuss it before the people than be victorious without it
2852360 both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish and the war came
2852361 i am rather inclined to silence and whether that be wise or not it is at least more unusual nowadays to find a man who can hold his tongue than to find one who cannot
2852362 fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
2852363 public sentiment is everything with public sentiment nothing can fail without it nothing can succeed
2852364 that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom and that this government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth
2852365 i have never studied the art of paying compliments to women but i must say that if all that has been said by orators and poets since the creation of the world in praise of women were applied to the women of america it would not do them justice for their conduct during this war i will close by saying god bless the women of america
2852366 i have not permitted myself gentlemen to conclude that i am the best man in the country but i am reminded in this connection of a story of an old dutch farmer who remarked to a companion once that it was not best to swap horses while crossing streams
2852367 whenever i hear any one arguing for slavery i feel a strong impulse to see it tried on him personally
2852368 the probability that we may fall in the struggle ought not to deter us from the support of a cause we believe to be just it shall not deter me
2852369 in regard to this great book i have but to say it is the best gift god has given to man all the good the savior gave to the world was communicated through this book
2852370 reply to loyal colored people of baltimore upon presentation of a bible
2852371 property is the fruit of labor property is desirable is a positive good in the world that some should be rich shows that others may become rich and hence is just encouragement to industry and enterprise let not him who is houseless pull down the house of another but let him labor diligently and build one for himself thus by example assuring that his own shall be safe from violence when built
2852372 the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present the occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion as our case is new so we must think anew and act anew we must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country
2852373 my friends no one not in my situation can appreciate my feeling of sadness at this parting to this place and the kindness of these people i owe everything here i have lived a quarter of a century and have passed from a young to an old man here my children have been born and one is buried i now leave not knowing when or whether ever i may return with a task before me greater than that which rested upon washington without the assistance of the divine being who ever attended him i cannot succeed with that assistance i cannot fail trusting in him who can go with me and remain with you and be everywhere for good let us confidently hope that all will yet be well to his care commending you as i hope in your prayers you will commend me i bid you an affectionate farewell
2852374 discourage litigation persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever you can point out to them how the nominal winner is often a real loser in fees expenses and waste of time as a peacemaker the lawyer has a superior opportunity of being a good man there will still be business enough
2852375 i will say then that i am not nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in anyway the social and political equality of the white and black races that i am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes nor of qualifying them to hold office nor to intermarry with white people and i will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which i believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality and inasmuch as they cannot so live while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior and i as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race i say upon this occasion i do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be denied everything
2852376 i have never said anything to the contrary but i hold that notwithstanding all this there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the declaration of independence the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
2852377 i have stepped out upon this platform that i may see you and that you may see me and in the arrangement i have the best of the bargain
2852378 the demon of intemperance ever seems to have delighted in sucking the blood of genius and of generosity
2852379 the will of god prevails in great contests each party claims to act in accordance with the will of god both may be and one must be wrong god cannot be for and against the same thing at the same time in the present civil war it is quite possible that gods purpose is something different from the purpose of either party and yet the human instrumentalities working just as they do are of the best adaptation to effect his purpose
2852380 we are not enemies but friends we must not be enemies though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature
2852381 what is conservatism is it not adherence to the old and tried against the new and untried
2852382 we all declare for liberty but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing with some the word liberty may mean for each man to do as he pleases with himself and the product of his labor while with others the same word may mean for some men to do as they please with other men and the product of other mens labor here are two not only different but incompatible things called by the same name liberty and it follows that each of the things is by the respective parties called by two different and incompatible names liberty and tyranny
2852383 there is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law
2852384 address before the young mens lyceum of springfield illinois january 27 1838 p 113
2852385 in your hands my dissatisfied fellow countrymen and not in mine is the momentous issue of civil war the government will not assail you you can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors you have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government while i shall have the most solemn one to preserve protect and defend it
2852386 i happen temporarily to occupy this big white house i am living witness that any one of your children may look to come here as my fathers child has
2852387 speech to one hundred sixty sixth ohio regiment august 22 1864 p 512

2852389 address before the young mens lyceum of springfield illinois january 27 1838 p 109
2852390 i do therefore invite my fellow citizens in every part of the united states and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands to set apart and observe the last thursday of november next as a day of thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent father who dwelleth in the heavens and i recommend to them that while offering up the ascriptions justly due to him for such singular deliverances and blessings they do also with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience commend to his tender care all those who have become widows orphans mourners or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged and fervently implore the interposition of the almighty hand to heal the wounds of the nation and to restore it as soon as may be consistent with the divine purposes to the full enjoyment of peace harmony tranquillity and union
2852391 i have been shown in the files of the war department a statement of the adjutant general of massachusetts that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle i feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming but i cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the republic they died to save i pray that our heavenly father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom
2852392 it is said an eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a sentence to be ever in view and which should be true and appropriate in all times and situations they presented him the words and this too shall pass away how much it expresses how chastening in the hour of pride how consoling in the depths of affliction
2852393 if all do not join now to save the good old ship of the union this voyage nobody will have a chance to pilot her on another voyage
2852394 neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease each looked for an easier triumph and a result less fundamental and astounding both read the same bible and pray to the same god and each invokes his aid against the other it may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just gods assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other mens faces but let us judge not that we be not judged the prayers of both could not be answered that of neither has been answered fully the almighty has his own purposes
2852395 all men are created equal except negroes and foreigners and catholics
2852396 you think slavery is right and should be extended while we think slavery is wrong and ought to be restricted that i suppose is the rub it certainly is the only substantial difference between us
2852397 stand with anybody that stands right stand with him while he is right and part with him when he goes wrong
2852398 to state the question more directly are all the laws but one to go unexecuted and the government itself go to pieces lest that one be violated even in such a case would not the official oath be broken if the government should be overthrown when it was believed that disregarding the single law would tend to preserve it but it was not believed that this question was presented it was not believed that any law was violated the provision of the constitution that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it is equivalent to a provision is a provision that such privilege may be suspended when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety does require it it was decided that we have a case of rebellion and that the public safety does require the qualified suspension of the privilege of the writ which was authorized to be made
2852399 there are no accidents in my philosophy every effect must have its cause the past is the cause of the present and the present will be the cause of the future all these are links in the endless chain stretching from the finite to the infinite
2852400 ive been looking for an indicator to let me know where im going to be at and i think today let me know
2852401 i had a real specific mri and doctors said i had a slight strain in my tendon so it was a little worse than what the u s doctors had seen
2852402 i did have slight doubts but thats just a part of it
2852403 being a track and field athlete sometimes you think youre superman you can run any time you feel any pain do a warm up spray some stop pain on it and it will go away it went away in about a couple of weeks
2852404 someone told me this is one of the most anticipated 100 meter dashes in olympic history
2852405 everyone knows i havent raced since nationals i think that was good for me if i would have ran all rounds of the 200 i would have been fatigued i have seen a lot of people from the u s not running as fast as they were a lot of peoples bodies are tired so i think this rest really did me well
2852406 a conscience which is not fully enlightened both to the seriousness of its condition before god and to the grandeur of gods merciful provision of redemption will inevitably fall prey to anxiety pride sensuality and all other expressions of that unconscious despair which kierkegaard called
2852407 2 6 groove because the bass is moving from bb to f which are the
2852408 2 3 6 progression or using the 7 to get to the 3 and the 3 to get to the 6 thus a
2852409 2 3 6 progression because the root bass is going from bb which is the 2nd tone in the ab scale to c the 3rd tone to f the 6th tone
2852410 we didnt get ourselves out of the box quickly enough when clearing the ball and they made us pay on two occasions
2852411 time will tell how good the result was as its still very early days
2852412 the best team won i would rather get the errors and indifferent performances over in the first game and we have done that
2852413 we deserved the goal and gary was in the right place at the right time it was a great finish
2852414 he is going as strong as ever and we are going to need him to stay that way
2852415 they brentford didnt take their chances and after that i thought we were pretty good
2852416 im delighted because everybody played their part and the team spirit was fantastic its about who wants to win it most and we did
2852417 we werent good enough throughout the 90 minutes and thats why we got beat
2852418 im lost for words im so disappointed its untrue i will take full responsibility for it
2852419 i was pleased with the performance once we got in front we had too much movement in our game for them to handle
2852420 to come to a place like darlington on our first game back in the league and get a point shows this side can match anybody on their day
2852421 we thought we could sit back and defend a 1 0 lead
2852422 we worked hard off the ball and were hard to play against
2852423 if we were a bit more clinical in front of goal we would have won the game
2852424 we should have had the momentum we gave away another stupid goal just before half time
2852425 you have to graft and grind results out but its all about winning games that brings confidence
2852426 when you are on minus 17 points its important to get a good start
2852427 the players deserve a lot of credit and i think we deserved the win we have a good group of players and now i want to try and add to them
2852428 one nil at half time didnt flatter us at all
2852429 they spent more on one player than my entire budget
2852430 they have shown real dedication in the last couple of years theyve wanted to come back and reclaim the gold for the united states and tonight is a good first step
2852431 you can see how much the game means to him
2852432 thats what you see over here guys bringing out the best in each other
2852433 for the old fashioned traditionalist its a nice thing to see seeing that the sum is better than its individual parts thats what this wonderful game is all about
2852434 he has been all over the place terrific performance from lebron james
2852435 this guy is so powerful he could play any position
2852436 this is what weve been dreaming about it took us three years to finally get it underway weve been waiting for this opportunity for a long time lets go show the world what were all made of
2852437 this is the biggest stage ive ever been on by far i thought the nba finals was the biggest stage until i was a part of this this was by far the biggest stage for me for my career thus far
2852438 thats what halftime is for they saw the problems went in at halftime they fixed it and theyre executing so far so good
2852439 i guess you cant believe everything you read that is all i am going to say amazing when you get desperate when you get down you bring in the big gun
2852440 you get the feeling they could shoot blind folded and still hit the middle
2852441 she got an incentive from her parents of a cell phone if she won her match at the pan american games and she won
2852442 this game becomes very important because i think they spain and greece are both going to lose to the u s a team and a loss here would make it difficult to get into the medal round
2852443 both of these teams are the perfect examples of a team being bettered by the whole instead of an individual
2852444 they come in feeling good thinking they have a chance this is kind of an eye opening loss to spain
2852445 when you think of argentina words like chemistry continuity tough proud and confident come to mind they have already publicly came out and said they are going to beat the united states and win the gold medal
2852446 continuity in international play is so vital the awareness of knowing each other knowing where your teammates are going to be on the floor
2852447 too little too late for argentina they waited too long to build up their pressure defense
2852448 and the man from new jersey has put italy in front sixteen minutes in and rossi is pouncing like a predator
2852449 you know its a high intensity game when you already have your hands on your thighs getting a breather
2852450 marco motta the architect tomasso rocchi the assassin and already a mighty hole has been dug for south korea
2852451 you have to have a sixth sense almost about where your teammates are and how theyre moving on and off the ball
2852452 the two goals theyve scored in this first half already bring them to a total of 122 in olympic history no nation has ever scored more in terms of a mens olympic soccer tournament
2852453 very much the icing on the cake for italy who are easing into the quarterfinals
2852454 for the players the only real difference will be the fact that they must have something on the grip that allows them to hold the stick effectively with reference to the turf it makes minimal difference
2852455 in this humidity and heat you have to be exceptionally fit
2852456 we were not very effective against st mirren you have to congratulate them for the way they played but we didnt have the imagination to break them down and we have to look at ourselves
2852457 i would have thought raising the league flag before the game and the party atmosphere would have inspired the players but that didnt happen
2852458 it could be a good result by the end of the season but as a coach you look at the performance and we will have to work to improve
2852459 im happy to see marc signing as he can pass the ball 15 yards and we couldnt do that very well on sunday
2852460 he brings passing ability imagination and a bit of zest but we have good players here so he will have to work hard before he gets a game
2852461 with a couple leaving in september to go and work with street pastors in antigua and some of the original recruits now working as street pastors in the east norwich area and students who have completed their time at university and left norwich we need to grow again
2852462 we often hear of people who feel they could be called to play a part in this work of being christs ambassadors on our streets displaying his love and care for those who may know nothing about him and of others who feel they would like to join the faithful band of intercessors who support those who go on the street with their prayers
2852463 we would like to encourage you to get in touch with us and ask more questions to find out whether or not this service is for you as we still have some spaces on our new training course which starts in september now is a good time to set the ball rolling
2852464 we are still looking at our position as to whether or not we can go ahead with our second phase construction without an announcement and with a minimal project or if it is better for us to wait to know where were going assuming some additional funding may be approved in the near future
2852465 as this building gets done and the need for additional buildings becomes apparent we will be making our case and hopefully well get positive responses
2852466 we are trying to retain somewhat of the alpine chalet concept we have with the other chalets
2852467 some of the roof lines for instance complement the existing chalets
2852468 everybody is up jumping around and were all having a good time
2852469 im pumped about paying baseball because were getting to play teams from all over the island i think well do awesome
2852470 this was a good opening ceremonies it was a great experience
2852471 i just like coming to this stuff especially watching all the athletes coming in to represent each section of the province
2852472 maybe a gold medal should be awarded to our summer games host committee chairperson brian bonnell and the hundreds of volunteers that have already come out to prepare for these games and will see them through to the end
2852473 these games will leave us a legacy that will contribute to the well being and enjoyment of everyone for years to come
2852474 the games are held for the athletes it is our hope the games will generate a lifelong participation in sports foster sportsmanship and encourage the development of athletic skills
2852475 individual commitment to a group effort is what makes a team work
2852476 it is our hope these games will serve as a catalyst to encourage more young people to become more involved and make physical activity a part of our daily lives as well as demonstrate the success that can be achieved when communities work together
2852477 they play a significant role as governments strive towards the promotion of active healthy living and the continued development of sport and the creation of opportunities for the provinces talented athletes
2852478 you can feel an abundance of spirit and energy here tonight which i am sure you will carry with you over these next days
2852479 you have demonstrated you have the skill dedication and character needed to compete at an elite level
2852480 i hope you will remember these games not only for the great competition but also the camaraderie and the wonderful memories that give true meaning to participation in sport
2852481 was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2852482 the mainstay sites such as the corner brook museum and archives the railway museum and the hockey hall of fame will once again be participating but there are some new ones that i am sure will please local residents and tourists alike
2852483 another plus this year is having the sir wilfred grenfell college art gallery participate
2852484 they currently have the great book of gaelic exhibit a collaboration of work by 200 poets visual artists and calligraphers from ireland and scotland
2852485 the heritage foundation encouraged us to have venues that offered more than architecture and we are very pleased to have the art gallery and the gillams historical society museum come onside with us to fulfill this mandate
2852486 we cannot as the european union presidency we cannot accept at our doors just very close to europe to accept such a middle age medieval battle impossible
2852487 we have two teams who have tried since friday to go from tblisi to south ossetia but the security situation is still very bad and so it was not possible for this team to go into south ossetia
2852488 they are at the moment in gori which is just south of the border of south ossetia and we are hoping as soon as possible to be able to go inside to south ossetia
2852489 the united states and the world community should stop the intervention and invasion of my sovereign country
2852490 i think the u s is the most powerful country in the world i think the u s has lots of leverage and i think there are lots of diplomatic means that it could be done through this is not about georgia anymore this is about basic values of humanity
2852491 we do not need further military action we need to bring back peace we proclaim a cease fire we are willing to sign the document on non use of force and no resumption of hostilities we are willing to be as flexible as we can on sovereignty issues for south ossetia
2852492 should be held accountable for barbaric and treacherous attacks on innocent civilians in south ossetia
2852493 there is no water no light no bread no gas nothing its a nightmare
2852494 who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men the shadow knows
2852495 what games are appealing to wii owners what is a safe development pattern to recoup investment
2852496 anybody can be a glutton but only a true cyclist is a bottomless pit
2852497 i think what we need to do right now is continue to work to solve this peacefully and if it is true the georgians have started pulling out that might get us to where we need to be to start the cease fire
2852498 russia has claimed that its military operations were intended to protect its peacekeepers and the civilian population in south ossetia
2852499 yet its reaction goes far beyond any reasonable measures required to do so indeed its escalation of the conflict has been the immediate cause of increased loss of innocent life and humanitarian suffering
2852500 in that conversation foreign minister lavrov told u s secretary of state rice that a democratically elected president of georgia and i quote must go i quote again saakashvili must go this is completely unacceptable and crosses the line
2852501 i want to ask ambassador churkin is your governments objective regime change in georgia the overthrow of the democratically elected government of georgia
2852502 your interesting reference to the diplomatic telephone call this confidential call between our minister and your secretary of state
2852503 i would like to say straight away that regime change is an american expression we do not use such an expression im encouraged by the fact that you have referred to this publicly i suggest that this means this is an interesting idea and that you are ready to bring this forward to the public platform
2852504 i want to restate my question to ambassador churkin he did not answer my question
2852505 is the goal of the russian federation to change the leadership of georgia
2852506 maybe the ambassador was not listening when i gave my response maybe he did not have his earpiece on i suggest that i gave a full response to that question
2852507 we appeal to our friends and allies to call on russia to cease hostilities immediately
2852508 georgia is a peace loving nation but today we are being attacked north to south east to west
2852509 there is panic in zugdidi people are leaving their houses and are moving towards nearby mountainous villages
2852510 earlier i spoke with zugdidi residents in the center of the town and they told me that around 500 russian armored vehicles are stationed near the enguri bridge at the administrative border between abkhazia and georgia proper it is no longer possible to say what is happening in zugdidi right now as we are going towards villages and are moving farther away from the town no one is staying there the grocery market was closed in the morning zugdidis center is not functioning everything is closed
2852511 we have left practically all of south ossetia as an expression of goodwill and our willingness to stop military confrontation
2852512 people are in a difficult situation especially women old people children
2852513 they have seen a lot of tragedy there i would like to draw your attention to the following according to their impressions all this is beyond the understanding of what military actions are and in my opinion these are elements of genocide against ossetian people
2852514 no singh will not be questioned by the suva police but by the labasa officers who are waiting on him to return to labasa
2852515 with those bills and the tuition coming due and hanging over your head it does put you in a bit of a panic
2852516 only to find out the lenders theyve chosen are no longer going to be offering loans this fall
2852517 some of these rates have no caps which means if interest rates rise you could be up to paying 15 to 18 percent on these loans
2852518 you know when he comes out so its very scary
2852519 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2852520 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2852521 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2852522 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2852523 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2852524 we hope that there is no further bloodshed there has been too much bloodshed already
2852525 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2852526 it has to be condemned and the world needs to stand against it
2852527 fortele noastre navale au primit misiunea de a impiedica ajungerea in georgia pe mare a armelor si a altor echipamente militare
2852528 daca uniunea europeana ramine ferma este probabil ca rusia sa fie mai inclinata sa o asculte
2852529 rusia stie foarte bine ca se poate juca foarte usor cu europa datorita relatiilor bilaterale directe pe care si le a dezvoltat cu tarile care o intereseaza
2852530 pune franta si germania intr o postura delicata si prudenta
2852531 it takes about 12 ounces of energy to make a single 12 ounce can
2852532 well designed and well managed landfills in particular seem to be far more apt to preserve their contents for posterity than to transform them into humus or mulch
2852533 they are not vast composters rather they are vast mummifiers
2852534 its too late to do anything about reducing waste by the time it gets to the landfill
2852535 we need to let go of the disposable mentality if you dont absolutely need it dont buy it
2852536 well i think the big problem for franken is hes trying to get his party going and in the base of his party mccollum is a democrat and the message she sent out during the democratic convention here in minnesota was that frankens past commentary was offensive to women particularly his playboy piece
2852537 many students are bringing thousands of dollars of electronic equipment into their dorm rooms with little to no security precautions its just open season for criminals
2852538 inte nnu vi r inte klara men vi forts tter i morgon
2852539 acest proiect este primul de acest fel din iasi si ne propunem sa ajutam atit copiii cu deficiente grave cit si parintii acestora vrem sa aratam ca acesti copii exista si ca nu merita sa fie marginalizati
2852540 cred ca se aplica legea compensatiei copilul meu are auzul extraordinar
2852541 e o provocare sa ingrijesti un astfel de copil nu multi parinti stiu sa faca asta si din nefericire inca ne mai luptam cu mentalitati gresite inca mai sint parinti carora le e rusine cu propriii copii
2852542 pina sa ajung la acest centru nu mi am lasat baiatul niciodata singur nu minca fara ajutor nu urca scarile singur acum ceva s a schimbat in primul rind mi am dat seama ca sint lucruri pe care el le poate face si fara ajutorul meu apoi am reusit sa ma conving ca el trebuie sa mai iasa si din casa sa cunoasca si alti oameni
2852543 cred ca se aplica legea compensatiei copilul meu are auzul extraordinar nu vorbeste insa aude telefonul sunind din cealalta parte a casei
2852544 astfel de parinti nu au niciodata timp pentru ei grija lor permanenta este copilul prin faptul ca ii pot lasa citeva ore aici stiind ca fiul lor este in siguranta au si ei un moment de respiro in care sa se ocupe de altceva sau sa se odihneasca
2852545 ma gindesc citeodata ca poate o impovarez prea mult pe fata mai mare nu mi a zis niciodata nimic insa simt ca este frustrata citeodata de atentia pe care i o acord danutei si stiu ca este foarte greu pentru ea
2852546 nu a fost simplu sa mi cresc copiii tatal lor a intentat divort si a vrut sa ia cu el numai fata sanatoasa din fericire mi am pastrat ambii copii si m am recasatorit cu un om minunat care le iubeste pe amindoua ma numar printre norocoase
2852547 numai cine a trecut prin asa ceva poate intelege ce simte un parinte care are un copil cu handicap psihic
2852548 acesti copii au un simt in plus fata de noi
2852549 acesti copii au un simt in plus fata de noi ceilalti sint convinsa de asta depinde doar de noi sa i invatam sa ne accepte
2852550 in judet avem peste 500 de copii cu dizabilitati psihice in familii si din cauza numarului mare am hotarit si infiintarea unei echipe mobile de specialisti care se deplaseaza la domiciliul lor pentru consiliere practic ii invata pe parinti exercitii simple de recuperare care sint la indemina fiecaruia
2852551 centrul de zi a fost infiintat cu doua scopuri degrevarea parintilor de copilul care poate deveni la un moment dat o povara si dezvoltarea in rindul copiilor a unor atitudini si deprinderi in limita posibilului a gravitatii bolii in cazul unora o evolutie extraordinara poate fi reprezentata doar de simplul fapt ca se deplaseaza singuri alti copii au invatat sa scrie la 14 ani sau au invatat sa manince
2852552 how can this happen especially when she claimed to be proud of the country look at the new zealand flag flying upright behind the sg contigent
2852553 speaking of south ossetia tskhinvalis residential housing and border villages everything has been virtually destroyed to put it mildly people are going to need help to return to their homes and to rebuild their houses and apartments
2852554 as the events at the start of august have showed verbal statements by georgian leaders cannot be trusted a commitment not to use force is what russia and the international community has insisted on over the past few years while georgia has used various pretexts to reject it without this obligation being set there can be no negotiations with georgia
2852555 the purpose of the black sea fleet vessels presence in this region is to provide aid to refugees
2852556 these reports are not true a blockade of the coastline would mean war with georgia and we are not in a state of war with georgia
2852557 the situation in abkhazia remains extremely concerning with a military build up continuing on the abkhaz side of the zone of conflict as well as bombings of the upper kodori valley
2852558 tomorrow we will send 200 tons of food 16 tons of medical supplies six electricity generators and water filters
2852559 the georgian side has named some nearby populated areas and towns saying they are being bombed by the russian air force i take full responsibility in saying that the russian side did not bomb any populated area
2852560 this issue was actually decided but georgia proposed setting up the corridor for only two hours and allowing the refugees to leave only into georgia even though the people want to go to north ossetia in russia
2852561 we confirm the withdrawal of georgian troops during the night from tskhinvali most of the city is now controlled by russian peacekeepers the georgian side has started to pull its units out of tskhinvali
2852562 one crew was evacuated to a russian hospital and we have no information on the second crew
2852563 the attacks by eastern turkestan terrorists have never stopped in the xinjiang region
2852564 the very purpose of their attacks is all about separating the region from china and such a behavior would not be tolerated by any country in the world
2852565 of course i imagine they want to leverage the platform of the olympic games to magnify their impact
2852566 i believe their very purpose of doing all this is about separation
2852567 there were bombs that were either produced or stockpiled and there were guns involved
2852568 but thats still pretty low level were not looking at ieds buried bombs set off by cell phones as weve seen in afghanistan and iraq
2852569 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2852570 we appeal to our friends and allies to call on russia to cease hostilities immediately georgia is a peace loving nation but today we are being attacked north to south east to west
2852571 russian troops russian tanks that moved into south ossetia on their way expelled the whole ethnically georgian population of south ossetia
2852572 theyve committed as of this morning ethnic cleansing in all areas they control in south ossetia
2852573 russian forces have been specifically targeting civilian quarters they specifically attacked and blew up the whole civilian quarter in the town of gori far away from the place where the conflict area is and where direct friction between forces is
2852574 they attacked civilian installations in the western part of georgia theyve attacked residential quarters all around the country theyve attacked civilian hospitals and most of the casualties are among civilians
2852575 close to the artillery base located near the entrance to the city we saw a dreadful sight
2852576 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2852577 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of august 6
2852578 an act of aggression that is incompatible with international law and fundamental principles of security and cooperation in europe

2852584 odata ce le am facut adresa si i am instiintat ne au transmis expertiza si valoarea activelor ne au adus la cunostinta ca sint ipoteci iar noi ne am asumat acest lucru acum ce mai vor puteau sa ne dea diferite raspunsuri prin care sa ne interzica cumpararea dar nu au facut o noi i am notificat imediat dar ei au intirziat doi ani de zile
2852585 finantele nu le au dat nici un raspuns concret le a explicat care este situatia judiciara a imobilelor si au cerut completarea cererii cu anumite documente din cite vad antecontractul e valabil si cred ca este o situatie care clar va ajunge in instanta
2852586 m a mutilat in timpul operatiei de fibrom uterin fisurindu mi vezica urinara si vaginul am fost externata pe 2 august din cauza starii grave in care ma aflam cu hemoragie si dureri groaznice am fost reinternata pe 6 august si pe 28 august 2006 la sectia de ginecologie la elena doamna
2852587 doctor iancu m a dus personal la spitalul parhon din iasi la un consult urologic si astfel am aflat ca am vezica si vaginul fisurate spunindu mi ca voi fi operata peste doua luni doctor iancu s a palmuit dupa precizarea diagnosticului de fistula vezico vaginala
2852588 am dat milioane pe medicamente si timp de opt luni am purtat pampers pentru ca aveam pierderi de urina in decembrie 2006 am fost internata la spitalul fundeni din bucuresti iar la data de 8 ianuarie 2007 am fost din nou operata pina in prezent starea mea nu s a imbunatatit deloc
2852589 analizind inscrisurile medicale folosite ca proba si documentele retinute in solutionarea cauzei ca masuri de cercetare a faptei si dupa audierea medicului intimat si administrarea tuturor probelor apreciate ca fiind necesare constata ca faptele si imprejurarile au constituit abatere de la buna practica medicala doctor doina iancu a efectuat gesturi insuficente intraoperator in prepararea bontului vaginal astfel incit sa se evite prinderea vezicii urinare in sutura bontului
2852590 mustrarea este una din sanctiunile pe care le poate primi un medic in cazul unei abateri disciplinare daca s a incalcat codul deontologic medical si nu s au respectat regulile medicale colegiul medicilor poate da una din aceste sanctiuni doctorita respectiva sub sanctiunea de mustrare nu mai poate fi promovata in functie intr un spital nu poate solicita gradatie de merit la salariu sau alte beneficii decizia finala in legatura cu abaterea daca este vorba despre un caz de malpraxis o va lua instanta
2852591 nu mi s a facut dreptate sa si faca pedeapsa ca m a nenorocit am cinci copii si muncesc toti cu ziua ca sa ma intretina pe mine acum trebuie sa merg din nou la control la bucuresti insa nu mai am curaj sa ma operez
2852592 procedura incepe pe data de 18 august si se verifica etanseitatea instalatiilor de distributie si instalatiilor interne ale imobilelor este vorba despre o operatiune care presupune umplerea instalatiilor termice cu apa rece si care se desfasoara in fiecare an inainte de inceperea sezonului rece procedura vizeaza depistarea unor eventuale defecte aparute in retele in perioada calda a anului
2852593 life moves pretty fast if you dont stop and look around once in a while you could miss it
2852594 biblioteca traditionala nu mai rezista categoric trebuie sa se modernizeze si sa se faca vizibila multimedia si online numarul de utilizatori online creste anual de doua sau trei ori asa ca pentru a ramine pe piata trebuie sa ne conformam cererilor
2852595 were going to provide a fresh look an objective look
2852596 in areas that are more physically constrained were looking at an elevated system we might look at magnetic levitation vehicles
2852597 that will be in my estimation a billion dollar project just by itself
2852598 if was travelling from denver to grand junction i would want to be on an express train not a locals only train
2852599 the stress the white knuckle driving that most people experience thats not really a generally good thing to have your visitors experience when theyre coming here to ski

2852601 psychnumerology tm makes problem solving and decision making interesting and simple it was fun using the system easy to understand and more importantly accurate
2852602 i didnt know that the numbers i cons tantly see in my minds eye were
2852603 nu se poate ca 300 de angajati sa traiasca cu un salariu in medie de 700 de lei
2852604 salariile sint foarte mici dar s a oferit maximul posibil
2852605 nu se stie niciodata cind intra in faliment si noi raminem pe drumuri am avut conturile blocate iar fabrica este in litigiu cu finantele am avut o intilnire cu comitetul administrativ si am cerut marirea salariilor cu cel putin 35 am lasat apoi la 25 si abia ne au dat 8 incepind cu 1 august plus cinci bonuri de masa in urma negocierilor vom mai primi inca 8 de anul viitor din 1 februarie voi face un demers la directia de munca si l voi inscrie precum conflict de interese
2852606 nu se poate ca 300 de angajati sa traiasca cu un salariu in medie de 700 de lei iar directorul sa aiba un salariu brut de 9 600 de lei in contractul colectiv de munca este clar specificat cit este salariu mediu pe economie atita trebuie sa avem si noi salariile
2852607 nu ne ofera mai mult pentru ca sustine ca trebuie sa salvam fabrica daca ne da noua slarii mai mari ajungem sigur la faliment pentru noi nu mai conteaza dar pentru un director cu aproape 10 000 de lei pe luna trei luni de zile sint foarte importante
2852608 intr adevar salariile sint foarte mici dar s a oferit maximul posibil acesti bani trebuiesc justificati prin productivitate il inteleg pe domnul butescu dar sa nu uite ca sporurile acordate reprezinta 54 peste salariu orele suplimentare anul trecut erau platite cu 75 anul acesta a mai crescut cu 5 nimeni nu este impotriva angajatilor fabricii pentru ca unii dintre noi sintem colegi de 20 de ani

2852622 a lot of my friends that dont play football play fantasy im going to have no reason to do it but its going to be interesting to see that if people are enjoying it let them enjoy it
2852623 they might see a guys name on the board from the university at buffalo and they might want to watch this guy see what hes all about
2852624 that will broaden our name and get us out there
2852625 and if somebody wants to put me on their fantasy football team thats like a dream come true

2852639 the exploitation is almost limitless google has to fix it
2852640 it turns out a lot of people who develop these things arent good at security
2852641 weve been telling google about these vulnerabilities for years and they have not made corrective actions
2852642 they chose to open the doors and insomuch put a lot of consumers at risk
2852643 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities mr hotchkies said on the sidelines of a notorious annual defcon gathering of hackers in las vegas
2852644 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2852645 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty said hotchkies who saw a spike this year in the number of defcon attendees carrying macintosh laptops
2852646 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2852647 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple hotchkies said
2852648 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2852649 jail break because it liberates iphone models from the shackles of deals apple has with telecom giants providing exclusive service to the devices in varying countries
2852650 it shows people are getting proficient at analyzing apple software hotchkies said
2852651 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised
2852652 i dont think its worth me getting what i would call premature stress over something that may not occur
2852653 but that doesnt mean im not going to give it serious thought in the meantime

2852681 i dont think that we can construe from the northern territory some grand lessons for western australia
2852682 obviously were going to wait and see the results to be finalised during the course of this week
2852683 obviously generally the public says to politicians they want them to serve their term and get the job done but circumstances can bring early elections on and thats whats happened in western australia
2852684 nevertheless when elections come and go theres always a lesson for politicians in them i think the lesson from this election as prime minister kevin rudd has said and its a lesson for all politicians is youve always got to be in touch with the electorate and cant take anything for granted
2852685 this is a big wake up call for mr rudd
2852686 conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth

2852700 spectacular sins and their global purpose in the glory of christ
2852701 what does the fall of satan reveal about christs glory

2852703 while we are looking at god we do not see ourselves blessed riddance the man who has struggled to purify himself and has had nothing but repeated failures will experience real relief when he stops tinkering with his soul and looks away to the perfect one while he looks at christ the very thing he has so long been trying to do will be getting done within him

2852733 they said that the music competes with visual art and that music is not art
2852734 last year at the festival they had a live elephant who for two days with the help of her trainers was trained to take a brush with her trunk and dip it into paint and paint gobbledy goop on a canvas
2852735 this they consider art yet the music is less than art to them
2852736 why are opera singers not admitted to the olympic games
2852737 this is a no brainer why dont they make their own music festival were a tiny nonprofit we cant take on the whole world

2852751 ive never done an ebay auction before so i didnt know what to expect but i am upset and frustrated after someone from bristol bid 10m and ive since found out she hasnt got that sort of money
2852752 ive spoken to ebay and the bid stands there are also bids for 9m on there from other people but if the 10m bid is won then that person wont be able to pay for the estate and the auction will have been a waste of time it feels like people have been scuppering my genuine auction
2852753 people putting false bids on ebay should not be allowed however i have had more than 400 emails over the weekend wishing me well for my cancer treatment and many of them saying they are interested in buying all or part of what has been advertised on ebay
2852754 many of my smartest friends have been recently leaning towards clinton
2852755 i believe that his speeches are not detailed enough regarding his policy strengths

2852757 on the major issues there is no real gulf separating the two
2852758 oh thats so naive this is the way that politics is all politics is like this you cant punish one candidate because theyre using the style of politics
2852759 is that really all were trying to achieve in this election to get the republicans out of office
2852760 senator edwards has really a very straightforward question here which is will you continue to take money from lobbyists or will you take his position
2852761 yes i will i will because you know a lot of those lobbyists whether you like it or not represent real americans
2852762 tonight is a particular honor for me because lets face it my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely my father was a foreign student born and raised in a small village in kenya he grew up
2852763 theres no such thing as false hopes but what i know deep in my heart is that we cannot bring about change unless we are unified unless we do it together

2852770 one of the liveliest and most enjoyable nights at lyric in recent memory as cleopatra de niese might tempt even a castrato shes young shes beautiful shes funny shes sexy shes clever she dances very well and she sings even better
2852771 not only is the australian born american trained soprano strikingly beautiful to look at and to listen to she dances with the lissome pizazz of a showgirl de niese was such a magnetic presence at the lyric premiere of handels 1724 masterpiece friday at the civic opera house that you couldnt take your eyes off her if you tried it is hard to imagine this production working half as well with any other singing actress as cleopatra de niese sang danced and vamped up a storm while modeling a succession of body hugging outfits she also brought heart stopping emotional depth to the heroines more introspective arias
2852772 making her lyric opera debut the young soprano danielle de niese was an extraordinary presence as cleopatra she sang with power and clarity and imaginatively ornamented intricate lines even while engaged in mr georges playful dances ms de niese subtly captured every facet of a role that required her to be a ruthless schemer a ravishing seductress a pitiable victim and a fierce opponent

2852774 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population

2852820 for great maps which i defined as those that take information and by virtue of the mash up make it knowledge
2852821 i dont fear my death i fear what happens after it
2852822 eu particularmente acho donovan muito mais interessante que david lynch
2852823 when youre born you get a ticket to the freak show when youre born in america you get a front row seat
2852824 this was not an easy call for me i know that the fisa bill that passed the house is far from perfect i wouldnt have drafted the legislation like this and it does not resolve all of the concerns that we have about president bushs abuse of executive power it grants retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that may have violated the law by cooperating with the bush administrations program of warrantless wiretapping this potentially weakens the deterrent effect of the law and removes an important tool for the american people to demand accountability for past abuses thats why i support striking title ii from the bill and will work with chris dodd jeff bingaman and others in an effort to remove this provision in the senate but i also believe that the compromise bill is far better than the protect america act that i voted against last year the exclusivity provision makes it clear to any president or telecommunications company that no law supersedes the authority of the fisa court in a dangerous world government must have the authority to collect the intelligence we need to protect the american people but in a free society that authority cannot be unlimited as ive said many times an independent monitor must watch the watchers to prevent abuses and to protect the civil liberties of the american people this compromise law assures that the fisa court has that responsibility
2852825 the soulsville foundation which operates the stax museum of american soul music stax music academy and the soulsville charter school is so deeply saddened by the passing of isaac hayes that we are in state of shock
2852826 im playing a killer im not going to give anything else away
2852827 its a bank robbing movie so its one of those action packed films you get a little different side of me in that movie
2852828 its a new age young hip hop version of heat
2852829 these are young cool well dressed articulate bank robbers chris be the little homey
2852830 at the end of the day im going to focus on my music first
2852831 but me being onstage enhances me being in the movie and then me being in the movie acting catching characters gives me time to transform into a different character onstage
2852832 didnt seem to fit the world that i thought stephenie meyer created
2852833 you see the punch coming that doesnt mean its not gonna hurt when it hits
2852834 theres no way to make everybody happy when i do one thing that a lot of people want theres always the opposite reaction
2852835 but how can you possibly meet up with the expectations that this book had
2852836 it just got so built up there is no book in the world that could stand up to that so i knew it was going to happen but at the same time it hurts
2852837 if they really love the characters then i would hope that this would make sense to them because these are the true characters
2852838 this is the story the way it was always meant to be
2852839 it doesnt always work out that way sometimes you make a decision about what you want and you pay for it and you suffer for it and it doesnt work out those types of stories always leave me horribly depressed im not going to live in a world for a year at a time where thats going to be the ending if people wanted a really depressing tragic ending i gave them a lot of hints that it wasnt going to be that way they really shouldnt have been surprised
2852840 i should have known that people would feel that way
2852841 the name has been real to me for so long now that ive forgotten how unusual it would sound to everyone else
2852842 ive read a lot of books that i didnt like very much and that thought never occurred to me because i had read them i hadnt heard of doing that before thats not fun to hear
2852843 i hope that if they really do enjoy the other books theyll realize that this is kind of where it was supposed to go
2852844 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hard core family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2852845 one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
2852846 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2852847 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather
2852848 i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
2852849 a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives
2852850 his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set
2852851 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
2852852 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2852853 said shama 22 a marine corps veteran who served in ramadi iraq and is now an intern at the jerusalem funds palestine center in washington d c hes working toward a degree in international relations with the dream of working in the u s state department office of middle eastern affairs
2852854 when it comes to the quran im sure it says youre not supposed to wage war against others of the same religion
2852855 in ramadi iraq we were fighting al qaeda and al qaeda every day in the news at the time they were blowing up a mosque killing muslims and women and children to me i wasnt fighting against muslims i was fighting against extremists who had taken the religion
2852856 there were times we were going in places where instead of it having to be an ugly situation where marines dont speak arabic telling them to move from room to room instead i could speak to them
2852857 by the end of the day we were sitting there sipping tea with the iraqis in the house everybody is relaxing talking
2852858 i can never complain about being arabic and being in the military
2852859 because of the way my leaders have treated me i have nothing to complain about if anything being arab and being muslim in the military right now benefits a unit so much if anything it helps your career
2852860 only one of us could make it over the wall
2852861 when you make love to a woman you get revenge for all the things that defeated you in life
2852862 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2852863 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby

2852866 personal ne informeaza un important responsabil al comunitatii roma din romania cred ca diferentele dintre elitele romanesti si cele rome nu numai ca sint irelevante comparativ cu asemanarile dar in marea lor majoritate sint imaginate

2852896 people have different opinions on that type of thing i told you what mine is and i think for each person you do whats right for you for me part of the reason that i have anxiety is the fact that i feel like people are always staring at me so its important for me to make sure that i have my friends and vacation and what i do at home with my family and that type of thing stays private
2852897 am ales tema spectrului solar pentru ca este editia a saptea a taberei si pentru ca este o tema vesela cu posibilitati largi de exprimare artistii ne au trimis deja niste proiecte pe colori dar inca nu stim exact cum va arata

2852908 justice obviously was a huge record for us we took the ride the lightning and master of puppets concept as far as we could take it
2852909 there was no place else to go with the progressive nutty sideways side of metallica and im so proud of the fact that in some way that album is kind of the epitome of that progressive side of us up through the 80s
2852910 theres a certain kind of specific sound to that record peculiar sound whichever adverb you want to choose thats given it a kind of life of its own and a little bit of a vibe all its own there have been a lot of great musicians we admire whove come up and talked about what a great inspiration that album has been to them and to their sound its obviously awesome to be part of that that album also sent us on this whole other merry way because when we came back from touring on that record in 1989 we were like we have nothing more to offer on this side of metallica and that set us off on some other adventures when i think of the nine records weve put out its impossible for me to think of the music without thinking of the experience and when i think of the experience i have warm and fuzzy feelings but i also have questions obviously justice is well revered especially among a lot of our peers
2852911 that album songwriting wise it was just us really showing off and trying to show what we could do
2852912 weve jammed six riffs into one song lets make it eight lets go crazy with it i listen to some of that stuff and its pretty progressive sonically it has its shortcomings but that is the one where we were able to step forward from
2852913 we mixed that record while we were on the road
2852914 thats not an excuse for the way that it sounds but our ears were beat anywhere i go whenever i ask someone what their favorite record is someones bound to say justice its pretty great that across the line someone can jump into your history and feel comfortable
2852915 id have to go song by song i was just listening to 1997s reload and there are a couple of songs on there that i think are absolutely brilliant but as an album itself and as a time justice just isnt a good memory for me but those songs are good i have to try and erase the memory of that experience somehow and let the songs take me
2852916 its always the next one i think the forthcoming is great but theres always a better something the holy grail of guitar sounds i havent got there yet but i will on the next one ill write the ultimate song on the next one the hunger is always there to do it better
2852917 i dont have an excuse i just need a little help
2852918 due to various reasons it wasnt working out with us and him
2852919 we felt his heart was no longer in it after expressing his want to leave on numerous occasions this year which showed when he played live

2852923 consideram ca scaderea accentuata a cererii de vehicule usoare de pe piata americana si diminuarea interesului pentru camioane si vehicule sport din cauza scumpirii benzinei vor complica eforturile celor trei producatori auto de a se adapta la conditiile de pe piata
2852924 aceste elemente vor contribui la diminuarea considerabila in urmatorul an si jumatate a lichiditatii care este adecvata in prezent
2852925 consecinta va fi ca producatorii auto vor fi mai vulnerabili in fata conditiilor deja neprielnice din industrie economie si de pe pietele de credit

2852936 i love ben curtis a lot and i love the fact hes made the team
2852937 i just wanted to shoot something good and see what happened
2852938 i thought maybe i could catch boo but he was playing right in front of me so i knew by the last few holes that wasnt going to happen
2852939 its going to come down to how i play the next three events
2852940 hopefully i can play well and get on his radar im disappointed because i had a chance to take care of my own business this week and now it is out of my control ive got to play well

2852943 obviously i was trying to win but thats it its not disappointing
2852944 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2852945 hes such a talented player that its just a matter of time
2852946 theres guys that get a little bit fortunate they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way either because they play well or because somebody else comes back
2852947 i could see that he was hanging in there nicely and he had a good start and he hung on tough
2852948 i wasnt only focused about padraig i thought that ben had a realistic shot at it too and he was 2 3 4 under there the whole day unfortunately he made a couple bogeys coming in like i did but it was a three man race and padraig came up on top
2852949 i love ben curtis a lot and i love the fact hes made the team
2852950 i just wanted to shoot something good and see what happened
2852951 i thought maybe i could catch boo but he was playing right in front of me so i knew by the last few holes that wasnt going to happen
2852952 its going to come down to how i play the next three events
2852953 hopefully i can play well and get on his radar im disappointed because i had a chance to take care of my own business this week and now it is out of my control ive got to play well

2852956 i could have taken the line of the shot but that would have put me in the stands or i could have gone back to the tee i had to go in there and try to hit something i tried to hit a 3 wood and i didnt get it out
2852957 it was my first time in the last group in a major and i dont think it will be my last time
2852958 im disappointed for j b holmes but hes still on my radar
2852959 i would have liked to obviously play better but i had a good week
2852960 i had my ups and downs had a little go of it early in the round and tried to make a move
2852961 it was tough weather and it hurt to miss those par putts but im just proud of myself the way i hung tight
2852962 the wind was really starting to blow so i tried to hit a low 4 iron that was the strongest iron i had in the bag
2852963 it started off perfect and i said be as good as you look then when it landed i called out go in the hole
2852964 the guys just cracked up when it went in especially since i called it
2852965 knox county notified state police of the incident and our detectives responded
2852966 at this point based on the investigation so far we are considering it a homicide
2852967 there was a festival on the island this weekend but were not sure if they were on the island for that or not
2852968 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity

2852970 coming back to the table negotiations peace talks a political solution thats it easy to say very difficult to do
2852971 it is the most surreal world crisis i could ever imagine
2852972 it started with severe bombing with artillery and planes and helicopters our boys with their guns could do nothing
2852973 they bombed us so may times all the houses are destroyed on one street there is only one wall left
2852974 and the driver asks me what my job is i tell him im a writer
2852975 public opinion now is very bad if i tell him im an mp i worry hell get angry or start accusing me of something
2852976 it was a very impulsive reaction people felt the commission had gone beyond what was allowed by law
2852977 the kpk was created by parliament its bill was passed by parliament its members were elected by parliament and now theyre scared of it
2852978 most people are very alert now when using the phone
2852979 we have to be careful were frightened to discuss even legitimate issues about money most people would rather talk about those things in person than on the phone in case its misconstrued by the kpk
2852980 bribery is still rampant the kpk has just scared the mediocre corruptors and made the slick ones slicker
2852981 we can be slow as well to give greatness its due a mistake i made myself long ago when i voted against a federal holiday in memory of dr king
2852982 i was wrong and eventually realized that in time to give full support for a state holiday in arizona we can all be a little late sometimes in doing the right thing and dr king understood this about his fellow americans
2852983 i voted in my first year in congress against it and then i began to learn and i studied and people talked to me
2852984 and i not only supported it but i fought very hard in my home state of arizona for recognition against a governor who was of my own party
2852985 it cost too much money that other presidents were not recognized

2853011 hes going to be a great player and same with kaneakua friel
2853012 even though we were resting quite a few of our big playmakers we were driving we were moving the ball and we scored a touchdown
2853013 again this early in camp we are probably further along in looking at contingencies than we ever have been but just looking at our conference and out schedule we know thats going to be necessary so we are able to look ata some of those situations
2853014 i would say that the safety positions are more secure than the corner positions
2853015 david tafuna and kellen fowler have a better command i think and are making more of an impact in relation to all those players around them than our corners are and andrew rich is a very close third right now to either kellen or david and would probably be the next player in at either spot

2853028 the meaning of life play is something often written by a first time playwright who wants to pontificate about how brilliant he is for an hour or so every playwright has written one of these plays remember that i am a playwright when i say this every playwright has written one however the wise playwrights keep it to themselves or show it to a few friends get feedback and then hide it away from public view unless youve had one helluva life or youre a spiritual savant you shouldnt be trying to preach the meaning of life at the age of 25 live a little then get back to me
2853029 who thought this was going to be a good idea
2853030 it is totally different to the open i was very confident in the open
2853031 here i hit some of the wildest golf shots ever hit on a golf course on friday
2853032 if a couple of things had gone differently we would have been talking differently
2853033 the good thing about it is i felt good out there
2853034 the weakened us dollar translates to savings from expenditure incurred abroad which can be fairly hefty for bigger families
2853035 we have saved up for years and now the price is right so we decided to take the plunge
2853036 obviously there are some sticking points in any dialogue that well overcome tomorrow
2853037 the results have to be respected and allow for a new political scene
2853038 the hot and humid weather of the past few days is unlikely to occur
2853039 considering that i only started hitting last sunday after not being able to move my neck for a few days before which forced him out of cincinnati ill take a final
2853040 he has talent and hes been able to keep up his form for five or six weeks
2853041 this was the best win of my career i beat tommy robredo last year but this is the ultimate
2853042 its a good sign to get to a final if i can continue at this pace ill be fine by the time the open arrives

2853049 we are sad to announce that the tel aviv festival scheduled for august 14th has been cancelled the israeli promoters have cancelled the festival due to security issues we are sad to say that the agreed on advance fee for the show never showed up and in agreement with how our agent works to provide the best service and security to us as a band the show was pulled we really think it sucks big hairy balls but we have played way too many shows in the past where we or our agent have had to squeeze the agreed on fee from the promotor after huge hassles and sometimes paying money from our own pocket and in the end it just fucks with everyone from our fans us as people and those who work with us we hope there will be other opportunities in the future to make it possible for us to come and play under better circumstances peace the haunted
2853050 whether it will be funding or graduation rates we are still separate and unequal
2853051 right now we rank 49 out of 50 in funding education from the state thats a travesty
2853052 so with her having no challenge she dont struggle as hard as she used when she was being educated in the south
2853053 i think its important that the public schools get the same equal that the suburban schools does
2853054 i respect and agree with reverend meeks goal to increase education funding to that end i have called the legislature back into special session on tuesday to focus specifically on school funding but i think its wrong to encourage kids to miss school every time a child misses a day in school that child misses a chance to learn

2853075 youre walking like youre drunk and ive never known you to be drunk
2853076 im trying to walk like a normal person and i have to think about it and thats hard and each step i feel like im going to fall over and thats harder
2853077 you havent changed listen to how you giggle look at those movements and that cheek so much the same
2853078 im just a 22 year old guy caught up in this old mans body im not so wise and put together as everyone assumes i am just because im old im not stuffy or boring im fun alive with dreams too and i still want to chase the girls i dont know how to be in this body i just know how to be 22 and i miss it
2853079 respond to their environment producing natural shadows and highlights depending on the direction and intensity of the illumination around them
2853080 oh just gimme that i knew youd mess it up
2853081 what i dont know is why people pirate my games
2853082 i might be able to get a general idea as to why people pirate stuff in general from reading warez forums and every other story on digg but im not interested in the general case i want to improve my business and ensure i stay afloat and to do that it would be mad to sit in the corner and ignore the opinions of that section of the public who pirate my games
2853083 i wont publicise who e mailed me or even store the addresses share them tell anyone them or make any use of them whatsoever ill just read them nothing else it will be entirely off the record and effectively anonymous i wont hand any email addresses to the riaa mpaa bsa or anyone at all under any circumstances ever
2853084 i occasionally post about piracy on my blog and i get a lot of comments from people who defend piracy or think i am too strongly against it or that i blow it out of proportion
2853085 the last few times i read these comments i got to thinking about the other side of the fence and wondering if there was something i just didnt get pirates never talk to the developers so i thought id see if there was something i could learn from it if i asked them for their honest views
2853086 i think its crazy for people to resent such a small price for a game i dont feel like the world has ended though we all routinely spend more than 10 or 15 on things that dont last as long as a decent pc game
2853087 a 15 t shirt can be a spur of the moment buy but a game for the same cost needs to be a work of genius i dont get why that is
2853088 most of them have been generic piracy points which is interesting although not the original request
2853089 i have got a few sarcastic ones but a lot of very long well thought out explanations mainly from people who dont pirate games now but used to in the past
2853090 pirates deliver a more convenient product at a better price
2853091 the ones that bug me are the people who are just trying to save money but could afford it or the ones with some intellectual justification for believing its their human rights to get free stuff
2853092 the thing is i personally prefer single player games so thats the style of game i design i do think a lot about the best way to set up my game demos the website and what after sales support content and patches to provide in order to reduce the extent of piracy for my games
2853093 i honestly think i might learn something ip owners characterize all pirates as freeloading scum
2853094 pirates characterize all ip owners as fat cat billionaires in gold plated ferraris its about time we both listened to each other more
2853095 dont be afraid to talk about piracy a lot of big name developers have blamed piracy for disappointing sales and there is a perception that the minute you mention it everyone will kick you in the face because its happened a lot recently

2853108 ketika seorang hamba bertaubat dan allah menerima taubatnya maka allah berkehendak malaikat hafadzah nanti lupa terhadap perbuatan berdosa hamba itu
2853109 bukankah allah telah berfirman pada hari itu bersaksilah lisan lisan tangan dan kaki mereka atas apa yang mereka perbuat

2853132 instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water it would actually appear to be above the waters surface
2853133 what we have done is taken that material and made it much thicker

2853166 kalau uang buat bayar kontrakan ini kita sedekahin semua bulan besok kita bakal tinggal di mana pak
2853167 bu kata ustadz yang kita lihat di tv tadi itu sedekah bisa menghadirkan pertolongan allah dengan bersedekah harta kita akan bertambah bahkan dilipatgandakan sepuluh kali lipat tujuh ratus kali lipat bahkan berlipat ganda sudah banyak yang membuktikan keajaiban sedekah itu lho bu masa kita nggak mau ikutan sukses seperti mereka
2853168 la iya pak pengen sih tapi kita besok tinggal di mana
2853169 kita pindah saja ke rumah itu bu biar saja allah tahu bahwa dengan bersedekah kita malah diusir dari kontrakan ini siapa tahu diusirnya ke rumah itu he he he
2853170 dan tidakkah mereka mengetahui bahwa allah melapangkan rezeki dan menyempitkannya bagi siapa yang dikehendaki nya sesungguhnya pada yang demikian itu terdapat tanda tanda kekuasaan allah bagi kaum yang beriman
2853171 dan barangsiapa yang menyerahkan dirinya kepada allah dan dia berbuat kebaikan maka sungguh dia sudah berpegang kepada tali yang kokoh dan hanya kepada allah kesudahan segala urusan
2853172 bapak sanggup nggak bikin nasi bungkus tiap hari buat kami
2853173 ok kalau bapak sanggup silakan teken kontrak di atas kertas ini bahwa bapak sanggup menyediakan nasi bungkus untuk 15 000 pengungsi yang menjadi tanggungan kami sehari tiga kali makan bila cocok maka kontrak ini akan diperpanjang bagaimana pak
2853174 siapakah yang mau memberi pinjaman kepada allah pinjaman yang baik maka allah akan melipat gandakan pembayaran kepadanya dengan lipat ganda yang banyak dan allah maha menyempitkan dan melapangkan rezki dan kepada nya lah kamu dikembalikan
2853175 barangsiapa yang membaca surat yasin karena allah azza wa jalla allah akan mengampuni dosanya dan memberinya pahala seperti membaca dua belas kali jika surat yasin dibacakan di dekat orang yang sedang sakit allah menurunkan untuknya setiap satu huruf sepuluh malaikat para malaikat itu berdiri dan berbaris di depannya memohonkan ampunan untuknya menyaksikan saat ruhnya dicabut mengantarkan jezanahnya bershalawat untuknya menyaksikan saat penguburannya jika surat ini dibacakan saat sakaratul maut atau menjelang sakaratul maut maka datanglah padanya malaikat ridhwan penjaga surga dengan membawa minuman dari surga kemudian meminumkan padanya saat ia masih berada di ranjangnya setelah minum ia mati dalam keadaan tidak haus sehingga ia tidak membutuhkan telaga para nabi sampai masuk ke surga dalam keadaan tidak haus
2853176 barangsiapa yang mendatangi pekuburan lalu membaca surat yasin maka pada hari itu allah meringankan siksaan mereka dan bagi yang membacanya mendapat kebaikan sejumlah penghuni kubur di pekuburan itu
2853177 segala puji bagi allah yang telah meluapi lembah kalbu para wali nya dengan luapan cinta kepada nya dia yang membangunkan istana khusus agar luapan arwah para kekasih nya itu senantiasa menyaksikan keagungan nya dia pula yang menghamparkan padang marifatullah melalui rahasia rahasia jiwanya lalu kalbunya berada di sebuah taman surga taman itu penuh dengan lukisan lukisan marifatullah yang tiada tara sedangkan arwah arwah mereka berada di taman malakut tak sejenak pun arwah itu melainkan berada dalam keabadian penyucian pada nya duh rahasia arwahnya mendendangkan tasbih dalam tarian lautan jabarut nya
2853178 segala puja bagi allah yang telah membuka gerbang cinta nya bagi para kekasih nya lalu dia mengurai rantai yang membelenggu jiwanya sehingga mereka teguh dalam keharusan khidmah pada nya sedangkan cahaya cahaya nya melimpahi akal akal mereka lalu tampak jelas keajaiban keajaiban kekuasaan nya sedangkan kalbu kalbu mereka terjaga dari haru biru tipudaya yang menumpah pada pesona pesona cetak lahiriyah jagad semesta sampai akhirnya menggapai marifat paripurna amboi ruh ruh mereka tersingkapkan dari kemahasucian paripurna nya dan sifat sifat keagungan nya merekalah penempuh jalan hadirat nya dalam kenikmatan rahasia kedekatan dengan nya melalui tarekat dahsyat rindu dendam nya hingga mereka termanifestasi dalam hakikat melalui penyaksian ketunggalan nya mereka telah diraih dari mereka dan dia menyirnakan mereka dari mereka lalu mereka ditenggelamkan dalam lautan kemaha dia an nya dia memisahkan pasukan pasukan terpencar dalam kesatuan kitab nya bagi para kekasih terpilih nya lalu mereka terjaga oleh kerahasiaan jiwa melalui limpahan cahaya cahaya agar ia menjadi obyek manifestasi di samping ke tunggal dirian nya
2853179 jika kalian melihat seseorang bisa terbang bisa menembus batas geografis dengan cepat bahkan bisa menembus waktu yang berlalu dan yang akan datang janganlah anda anggap itu seorang wali allah sepanjang ia tidak mengikuti sunnah rasulullah saw
2853180 waliyullah itu diliputi oleh ilmu dan sedangkan wilayah hakikat senantiasa disaksikan oleh mata hatinya sehingga ketika ia memberikan nasehat seakan akan apa yang dikatakan seperti identik dengan izin allah dan harus dipahami bagi siapa yang diizinkan allah untuk meraih ibarat yang diucapkan pasti akan memberikan kebaikan kepada semua makhluk sementara isyarat isyaratnya menjadi riasan indah bagi jiwa jiwa makhluk itu
2853181 adalah merasa cukup bersama allah menerima ilmu nya dan mendapatkan pertolongan melalui musyahadah kepada nya
2853182 apakah kamu tidak cukup dengan tuhanmu bahwa sesungguhnya dia itu menyaksikan segala sesuatu
2853183 ingatlah bahwa sesungguhnya para wali wali allah itu tidak punya rasa takut dan rasa gelisah yaitu orang orang yang beriman dan mereka bertaqwa mereka mendapatkan kegembiraan dalam kehidupan dunia dan dalam kehidupan akhirat tidak ada perubahan bagi kalimat kalimat allah yang demikian itu adalah kemenangan yang besar
2853184 saya sedang duduk di hadapan guruku lalu terlintas untuk menanyakan tentang wali quthub
2853185 quthub itu banyak setiap muqaddam atau pemuka sufi bisa disebut sebagai quthub nya
2853186 barangsiapa yang membaca surat ar rahman allah akan menyayangi kelemahannya dan meridhai nikmat yang dikaruniakan padanya
2853187 barangsiapa yang membaca surat ar rahman dan ketika membaca kalimat fabiayyi l i rabbikum tukadzdzib n ia mengucapkan l bisyay in min l ika rabb akdzibu tidak ada satu pun nikmat mu duhai tuhanku yang aku dustakan jika saat membacanya itu pada malam hari kemudian ia mati maka matinya seperti matinya orang yang syahid jika membacanya di siang hari kemudian mati maka matinya seperti matinya orang yang syahid
2853188 pada suatu hari ada seseorang menghampar jubahnya di atas kuburan dan ia tidak tahu bahwa tempat itu adalah kuburan ia membaca surat al mulk kemudian ia mendengar suara jeritan dari kuburan itu inilah yang menyelamatkan aku kemudian kejadian itu diceriterakan kepada rasulullah saw lalu beliau bersabda surat al mulk dapat menyelamatkan penghuni kubur dari azab kubur
2853189 surat al mulk adalah penghalang dari siksa kubur surat ini termaktub di dalam taurat barangsiapa yang membacanya di malam hari ia akan memperoleh banyak manfaat dan kebaikan sungguh aku membacanya dalam shalat sunnah sesudah isya dalam keadaan duduk ayahku sa membacanya pada siang dan malam barangsiapa yang membacanya maka ketika malaikat munkar dan nakir akan masuk ke kuburnya dari arah kedua kakinya kedua kakinya berkata kepada mereka kalian tidak ada jalan ke arahku karena hamba ini berpijak padaku lalu ia membaca surat al mulk setiap siang dan malam ketika mereka datang kepadanya dari rongganya rongganya berkata kepada mereka kalian tidak ada jalan ke arahku karena hamba ini telah menjagaku dengan surat al mulk ketika mereka datang kepadanya dari arah lisannya lisannya berkata kepada mereka kalian tidak ada jalan ke arahku karena hamba ini telah membaca surat al mulk setiap siang dan malam denganku
2853190 mengapa seseorang selalu merasa kurang secara penghasilan mungkin karena ia kurang sedekah
2853191 supir ini datang ke klinik spiritual dan konseling wisata hati dia bilang gajinya cuma 800 ribu padahal anaknya lima ia ingin gajinya jadi 1 5 juta
2853192 nah selain untuk memanjangkan umur mengangkat permasalahan sedekah juga mampu membuat orang yang belum kawin jadi kawin dan yang udah kawin
2853193 maaf pak kira kira masjid ini butuh apa barangkali saya bisa bantu

2853196 dia cuma pingsan kebetulan yang nabrak orang kaya selain dibawa ke rumah sakit dia juga melunasi hutangnya
2853197 barangsiapa membawa amal yang baik maka baginya pahala sepuluh kali lipat amalnya dan barangsiapa yang membawa perbuatan jahat maka dia tidak diberi pembalasan melainkan seimbang dengan kejahatannya sedang mereka sedikitpun tidak dianiaya dirugikan
2853198 adab paling awal yang dibutuhkan dalam bab wudhu dan bersuci adalah mencarl ilmunya dan mempelajarinya mengetahui tentang fardlu dan yang sunnah sunnahnya apa yang dianjurkan dan yang dimakruhkan apa yang diperintahkan dan yang dianjurkan untuk memperoleh keutamaan
2853199 maka bertaqwalah kalian kepada allah sesuai kemampuan kalian semaksimal kalian
2853200 maka apabila telah datang ajal mereka mereka tidak dapat mengundurkannya sesaat pun dan juga tidak dapat memajukannya
2853201 sesungguhnya air itu memiliki kehidupan ia akan mati ketika ditumpahkan di atas tanah

2853226 the brown tree snake has often been used as a textbook example for the negative impacts of invasive species but after the loss of birds no one has looked at the snakes indirect effects

2853229 the implications are severe and thats why we consider bird conservation to be so important

2853273 i think thats pretty obvious the question is who are you you dont remember do you dylan
2853274 good the full moon is rising in a few minutes youll change and become the ultimate predator a hunting and killing machine a werewolf i need you fully functional with your memory intact because whatever happens to you happens to me too so i dont want you pulling some dumbass stunt like stepping in front of a silver bullet thats what started all this crap in the first place at lagorys castle
2853275 in due time right now your needs will be more immediate you will be incredibly hungry after you morph youll be driven to kill and eat human prey seems to me all you have to do is run down the hill and pick off that little beauty youve been shacking up with
2853276 yeah there were a couple of times when the two of you were going at it that i thought you were going to change on the spot that would have been interesting
2853277 legend has it the werewolf always kills the one he loves
2853278 why postpone the inevitable go get her she tastes as good as she looks
2853279 frustrating isnt it you want to beat the shit out of me and you cant even now you can feel the touch of the full moon upon you you dont want to change your candy ass morals abhor what you will do youll kill and youll feed youll be amok and youll have no choice
2853280 i on the other hand relish the slaughter im you without your stupid inhibitions im your id monster i do the things you wouldnt dream of doing things so horrible your mind cant even comprehend them and when im running with the moon i run wild
2853281 youll be waking up in a few moments youre going to change youre going to run down that hill and slaughter that little girl and have her for dinner

2853285 you cant do this dave i wont let you i made your mother a promise and its one im never going to break
2853286 theres nothing you can do james the execution is tomorrow mate i killed a man its called justice
2853287 its done james im dying tomorrow just let it be
2853288 actually it isnt ive been studying the case on the plane and i know for a fact you are innocent i have all the evidence i need and it isnt sherlock holmes stuff about you being left handed or something i know exactly what happened and you will not die tomorrow
2853289 no dave i believe in logic this is what really happened
2853290 i know you hated kevin parker as much as it possible to hate anyone and how what he did shattered any chance you had of having kids its ironic that the same prison overcrowding that led to your death sentence led to his early release
2853291 if you could have killed him then dave thats when you would have done it and not out of anything other than pure rage ive known you all your life dave and i know about your obsession with christianity revenge was never your thing but lisa on the other hand she was pregnant wasnt she when he raped her and that she lost the baby though you never told me lisa was devastated and it was lisa who killed parker she watched her only dream ended by his cruel lust and i have no doubts she has been planning this for years
2853292 she called you didnt she and told you what shed done that she was going to confess to everything you drove to his house and when you saw her you gave her time to leave the scene of the crime and then you took the rap they found a smaller set of bloody footprints leading out of the house but they were convinced by you that youd bought womens shoes and made the footprints to confuse things which you eventually did
2853293 i know you dave and i dont believe you capable of murder the biggest evidence is that the door wasnt forced you had no opportunity to obtain the key to his house parker was paranoid about security you could never have the only logic is that lisa gave you the keys which she would have had but that would have made her an accomplice and that was never suggested lisa killed him and wife or not you will not die for her sins
2853294 you really arent psychic are you you dont know about the miracle james
2853295 i would have turned her in myself but she told me something else that afternoon

2853382 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2853383 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2853384 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2853385 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2853386 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2853387 we hope that there is no further bloodshed there has been too much bloodshed already
2853388 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop

2853398 the government has its centrepiece building wa a package of infrastructure projects with such long lead times that many wont come to fruition until its time to vote again in another four years when victoria park mla ben wyatt is premier
2853399 it really requires the premier to come out immediately and clarify the situation
2853400 is ben wyatt the next in line during the next term is mr carpenter going to serve out the full term
2853401 mr halden does not say things like this unless theres truth to them
2853402 we had the federal government pull out of here in canberra some weeks ago and have had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the table and again at the 11th hour the state labor government here in queensland have pulled from attending the hearings
2853403 without diminishing the callous and brutal nature of this crime which was certainly committed partly for financial gain and with no regard to the sanctity of human life i believe that a determinate sentence is appropriate
2853404 my client states his instructions are that ben clark acted alone and that is what we maintained throughout the trial and unfortunately the jury did not accept that
2853405 im not sure i would have been able to handle him in any case today

2853413 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2853414 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2853415 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2853416 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2853417 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2853434 one only has to ask a division clerk of court or the chamber staff of justices to know that these sorts of things do happen and they have never been labeled as irregular or unceremonious

2853463 now we collect 150 to 200 tonnes of baobab fruit each harvest in the last weeks there has been an explosion in demand
2853464 we are thinking we will need a much bigger harvest next time
2853465 in senegal alone we estimate we could collect 13 thousand tonnes of fruit
2853466 and if it becomes an important revenue the farmers will know that they have to protect the tree
2853467 there are cattle herders that cut the leaves to feed their animals but we are starting to stop them now thats not good because we need the trees to produce fruit

2853490 some bloke yelled cant you do any better i turned around and said thanks mate ill tell the boys in the dressing room hahahahaaa
2853491 i think that its clear that we werent able to prepare well enough i cant see any other reason for our disappointing results we have very good players we all know that on training i see great one touch football but in the games we dont seem to play as a team in these circumstances the ball needs to do the work its too humid to keep on dribbling but in the matches i dont see a team play i see eleven individuals making wrong choices maybe we needed more time but in todays football its hard to gel a team together babel was injured drenthe was in madrid etc etc the calender is full and our boys needed more preparation but i still have good hopes
2853492 we were very very lucky the usa won every personal challenge they seemed much fitter emanuelson told me after the match that he felt we are the weakest team physically thats a worry

2853500 gute ratschl ge sind mir lieb und teuer man muss dabei aber die hessischen verh ltnisse betrachten
2853501 es gibt attacken die sind nicht mehr akzeptabel besonders wenn es gegen die eigenen kinder oder familie geht
2853502 ypsilanti nach nordkorea handele es sich um eine solche grenzverletzung

2853511 thus sayeth the lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither let the mighty man glory in his might let not the rich glory in his riches but let him that glorieth glory in this that he understandeth and knoweth me that i am the lord who exercises mercy justice and righteousness in the earth for in these i delight sayeth the lord
2853512 that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet
2853513 we know more people are going to hear this record so were going to make the message bigger with the current situation in england its a pretty dire place to be for a lot of people its a great place but at the same time everything is getting more expensive and theres a new teenage knife incident every week its a pretty ghastly place at the moment the current situation around us is influencing franks lyrics and the way we write the music as well
2853514 of course the u s government should pay compensation its the u s militarys fault
2853515 we feel detailed investigation should be done by the u s government itself
2853516 the no gun ri incident became one of the milestones to take on this kind of incident in the future
2853517 u s forces napalmed numerous small buildings and strafed children women and old people in the open area
2853518 there were many similar incidents refugees gathered in certain places and there were air strikes
2853519 everybody came out of their houses to see these low flying planes and everyone was hit
2853520 the u s air force regarded all people in white as possible enemy
2853521 civilians in villages cannot normally be identified as either north koreans south koreans or guerrillas
2853522 i ran forward and all i could hear were people coughing and screaming and some were probably already dead
2853523 how could they not tell the cows the pieces of furniture
2853524 this is a matter of deep concern to the korean people
2853525 the killings of korean civilians were extensive intentional and indiscriminate
2853526 well today is the first day in the studio laying down drum tracks for our new album
2853527 das war ein guter auftakt aber auch ein pflichtsieg wenn wir ins viertelfinale kommen wollen
2853528 jetzt wollen wir die griechen besiegen und dann schauen wir mal was passiert

2853535 you dont think young people today are like they used to be
2853536 old photostat copies from the 20s and 30s are shiny like that so this is why youd think this is not a real document
2853537 you can see where theyre dipping the pen in to get more ink
2853538 i would say its probably a souvenir copy done at the time and signed at the time
2853539 we dont come out here to glorify war we come here to preserve its memory and its history lest we forget i think thats the major reason
2853540 see if you can get a 95 on this chapters test
2853541 see if you can keep the altitude within 50 feet out to the practice area
2853542 i didnt take my medicine it wont be a good day for ground school
2853543 we want to give them a more comfortable atmosphere to hang out in down here more their style more their music different vendors if you will appease to their culture
2853544 apparently there was a fight there was another arrest and theres bad interchange so to speak between young people and the seniors
2853545 get a lot more kids down there like skaters and not at the farmers market so we could listen to some music while skating
2853546 its going to be on the opposite side of the building of the nursing home thats right here so the sound shouldnt reflect too much
2853547 one day i saw an old lady who looked like she would be going to dialysis and she looked really sick and yet she still had to go to centrelink to get a store card i often get a bit sick when im waiting there
2853548 they say they cant give us the same services they give to people living in the urban areas
2853549 a lot of people especially a lot of those in town stereotype aboriginal people and say that we are all bad but child abuse happens in any society and any race the perpetrators could be a rich person or a poor person
2853550 aboriginal people need nutrition programs health programs and alcohol rehabilitation programs but it looks like the government has got its mind made up and it isnt really going to listen to what we have to say
2853551 g lens financial resources were detailed in the public prosecutors arguments which claimed that saudi arabia iran the turkish government and the central intelligence agency or cia were behind the g len movement it stated that some businessmen in ankara donated 10 to 70 percent of their annual income to the movement and that it corresponded to 20 000 to 300 000 per year per person it added that one businessman in istanbul donated 4 5 million each year and that young people graduating from g lens schools donated between 2 000 and 5 000 each year
2853552 because of the large amount of money that g lens movement uses to finance his projects there are claims that he has secret agreements with saudi arabia iran and turkic governments there are suspicions that the cia is a co payer in financing these projects

2853558 one of the main tools washington is using in this affair in order to get turkey involved in the xinjiang affair is some turkish americans primarily the fetullah gulen team who are prosecuted in absentia in turkey for trying to found a theocratic state order in this country because he runs his activities from the united states his prot g

2853561 and other similar books about these issues recently noted on
2853562 after 911 the us government engaged in mock investigations and shut down many small islamic charities and organizations giving the appearance of action in the so called war on terror why did they harbor support and resource fethullah gulens 25 billion madrassa and mosque establishment efforts throughout the central asian region and the balkans

2853567 i hope i can give the wood brothers a shot in the arm that they need to really get the momentum to move forward
2853568 i knew that he was going to be good we both came in together and left together and that was probably the win right there to be able to beat him off pit road once we did that i kind of got up through the esses better than him and we pulled away
2853569 it was a big hit for a bunch of guys
2853570 we were ready to attack i know with nine to go you get up on the wheel and push hard pushing and shoving is ok but that was crazy i guess there wasnt much place to go they kept pushing and shoving
2853571 which button yes now hold her hand you must hold her hand oh so sweet
2853572 oh man if they didnt go to el piano ill have to break the news to them

2853575 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2853576 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2853577 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2853578 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2853579 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2853580 this was a heinous attack by al qaida in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2853581 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2853582 al qaida is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here

2853609 but there were a few built in problems with the x files
2853610 klingt alles so als h tte sich mulders synchronsprecher leider den falschen film ausgesucht um seinen marktwert hochzutreiben er konnte ihn noch nicht kennen aber dem studio ist sicher bewusst gewesen dass sie da keinen knaller an der hand haben schlechte voraussetzung um bei den gagen zu pokern
2853611 damit synchronsprecher hierzulande also eine gage in solchen dimensionen erhalten k nnen m ssten die personen in der breiten ffentlichkeit bekannter werden sodass man eben auch mit ihren namen werben kann
2853612 wortvogel meines wissens nach erhalten die etwas bekannteren sprecher die einen schauspieler oder besser einen star fest betreuen eine antrittsgage zu der dann auch noch die honorare f r die einzelnen takes kommen
2853613 das issn knaller die hatten ein kind und das ist tot
2853614 so ein richtiges normales nicht alien kind mit vorher ganz normal einmal reinhalten
2853615 gerade als fan kann man den zweiten x files film ganz prima schlecht finden

2853621 there are certain things that are out of bounds for public discussion even if held in a private place
2853622 we believe open discussions and dialogues on issues of religious conversions are imperative to find solutions
2853623 not allowed to hold open discussions in relation to our constitution and its laws then it makes a complete mockery of our legal system
2853624 the healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria
2853625 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every millilitre of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth around half of these have yet to be named and we are trying to describe and name the new species
2853626 interestingly this species was isolated from within the oral tissues both in oral cancers and normal healthy tissue
2853627 this confirms other work showing that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells
2853628 amfar is a prestigious organization to get funding from if you do hiv research so its a big testament to the work were doing
2853629 we hope that it will help us reach latinos who are at risk for hiv and improve the outcomes for hiv positive latinos so they are not affected disproportionately
2853630 latinos generally do not go to the doctor to get tested to see if they are infected with hiv until they are very very sick
2853631 and once diagnosed they dont take their medicine as prescribed even when they have access to life extending medicines
2853632 there are a number of different things that are affecting the attitudes and opinions toward medicine of the latino community this study will give us a sense of all the variables that are affecting the trust or mistrust of medicine
2853633 we found one variant to be associated with weight and lean mass in both ethnic groups this variant was also associated with height total fat mass and hdl cholesterol but only in european american women a different variant was associated with triglyceride levels and hdl cholesterol in african american women
2853634 insects store fat like mammals do as lipid droplets accumulated in the fat body the functional equivalent of both mammalian liver and white adipose tissue

2853646 i thought that the frozen in concept was very good from a pedagogical point of view and indeed it became very popular in reality however it was not a good pedagogical concept but a dangerous pseudo pedagogical concept by pseudo pedagogical i mean a concept which makes you believe that you understand a phenomenon whereas in reality you have drastically misunderstood it
2853647 of course there can be no magnetic merging energy transfer the most important criticism of the merging mechanism is that by heikkila who with increasing strength has demonstrated that it is wrong in spite of all this we have witnessed at the same time an enormously voluminous formalism building up based on this obviously erroneous concept i was na ve enough to believe that magnetic recombination would die by itself in the scientific community and i concentrated my work on more pleasant problems to my great surprise the opposite has occurred merging seems to be increasingly powerful magnetospheric physics and solar wind physics today are no doubt in a chaotic state and a major reason for this is that part of the published papers are science and part pseudoscience perhaps even with a majority in the latter group

2853678 chronic homelessness decreased an average of 15 percent per year between 2005 2007 and demonstrates that targeted focused resources can achieve measurable results
2853679 local communities across the country report there were 123 833 chronically homeless persons in 2007 compared to 155 623 in 2006 and 175 914 in 2005
2853680 comparing the number of chronically homeless individuals from year to year should be done with caution declines can be attributed to several factors including increased funding from hud and other sources for permanent supportive housing improved data collection and reporting and variation in the number of communities reporting these data on an annual basis
2853681 average of 15 percent per year between 2005 and 2007
2853682 a chronically homeless person is defined as an unaccompanied homeless individual with a disabling condition who has either been continuously homeless for a year or more or has had at least four episodes of homelessness in the past three years to be considered chronically homeless a person must have been on the streets or in emergency shelter i e not in transitional or permanent housing during these stays as a practical matter the definition of chronic homelessness is based on historical information about a persons characteristics and service utilization yet many communities have difficulty collecting such information as a result many communities face a considerable challenge in estimating the size of their chronically homeless population thus the estimates should be interpreted as approximationsrather than precise measurementsthat are coming into sharper focus with each passing year

2853700 i miss hearing the sound of your voice telling me what youre thinking about
2853701 it was a very very good experience for our kids
2853702 it showed us what we need to get better at it was very enlightening i think our kids are going to get better and going to respond well from it now were getting ready for our scrimmage on friday we came out healthy which is a huge plus because you never want your kids to get hurt it helped us to determine where we are at
2853703 we made mistakes in terms of knowing where to be and what to do and we need to clean that stuff up i think we have potential to be a good football team
2853704 we have a lot to improve on defense they ran the option and we werent real sound against the option we havent prepared for that real well
2853705 number one is going to be some guys changing positions
2853706 we were able to tell what kids want to play football and want to play hard weve got to get those guys on the field
2853707 in terms of what a scrimmage is suppose to do it was exactly what we needed watching film was real good for them the number one thing defensively is lining up in the right spot and getting in position to tackle offensively we need to stay in our blocks throughout the entire play to get into sync offensively we werent too bad for our first scrimmage i thought we ran the ball hard and the quarterback made some good decisions we moved the ball on some plays the offense is ahead of the defense so weve got to get the defense shored up a little bit
2853708 theyve been working hard and getting better were improving and were going to continue to get better as a football team everything i saw that we need to work on is correctable
2853709 i want to make sure were doing everything to the whistle and that were sound fundamentally
2853710 there are things that we can do better weve got to get ready to go from play one it took a little while to get the cobwebs shook off in scrimmage but the kids have got to be more intense from the beginning
2853711 everything is pretty well fine other than the fact he has stitches
2853712 so we are going to try to get that healed and then we will get him back out here
2853713 he was in good spirits at the hospital and he is anxious to get back well just have to see how long it is going to take
2853714 i never put a timetable on guys because you dont know
2853715 all i know is hes gonna work to get back out here and hell be back when hes ready
2853716 things go easier you have more fun things flow better when youre having success im going to continue to just ride it out
2853717 you hear it all the time youve got to keep your mind in the moment
2853718 its easier said than done but its something youve got to be conscious of if you feel yourself thinking about the past or trying to think about the eighth inning in the fourth inning youre in trouble already

2853729 vamos a ver que van a publicar esta movilizaci n es dif cil de ocultar por los medios de la derecha de todas maneras grabamos unas tomas a reas para que sea mostrada la realidad y no la que ellos quieren mostrar

2853738 elders future will be built around its core network network related and complementary operations
2853739 we have evaluated assets and operations which are peripheral to that or which are unlikely to meet our performance targets
2853740 work is ongoing on other elements of the strategy enunciated by the board with the intention of further divestment of non core assets and realisation of capital within the current financial year
2853741 the strong result for the year was driven by good sales and margin growth in pipelines and tradelink

2853743 we got 99 percent of our energy from the middle east today it is zero
2853744 i have observed that in all other countries including in america people are complaining about how prices of gasoline are going up
2853745 the cure is not to reduce the price but on the contrary to raise it even higher to break our addiction to oil we are going to introduce a new tax reform in the direction of even higher taxation on energy and the revenue generated on that will be used to cut taxes on personal income so we will improve incentives to work and improve incentives to save energy and develop renewable energy

2853750 the first official message ever in which he speaks english
2853751 calls for the people to support jihad in pakistan and lists a litany of grievances against the pakistani government and us involvement there
2853752 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
2853753 also relates his own personal experiences having lived in pakistan in an apparent attempt to build a stronger connection with the pakistani people
2853754 wants to speaks directly to the pakistani people and chose english because he cannot speak urdu
2853755 what the bolivian people have expressed with their votes today is the consolidation of change
2853756 were here to move forward with the recovery of our natural resources the consolidation of nationalization and the state takeover of companies
2853757 its ugly and excessive a slap in the face to roman citizens if it was up to me id demolish it completely but because we havent got the money this is not possible
2853758 we are a city enslaved by its past so hung up on being the home of art culture and creativity that it doesnt realize that in reality it is static and hostage to politicians archaeologists and intellectuals who talk and talk but do nothing
2853759 its disgusting they put modernity right next to these two ancient churches covering them
2853760 unfortunately this is a city where that kind of architecture just wont be accepted
2853761 this is a sad legacy of the previous administration imposed on citizens from the top by two mayors who wanted it at any cost

2853767 the club still has six practices in training camp and he wants to spread the first team snaps around
2853768 hes been listed with other teams as a tackle but the 49ers are calling him a guard
2853769 the radical invents the views when he was worn them out the conservative adopts them
2853770 we expect solid organic growth as we build upon our strong position in our core markets and expand into new ones
2853771 we are mindful of global economic uncertainty and the challenging cost environment but barring any unforeseen factors our current forecasts suggest another year of double digit earnings growth in 2009
2853772 already we have locked in a large portion of our revenue target for the year and bidding opportunities are at record levels
2853773 we expect solid organic growth as we build upon our strong position in our core markets and expand into new ones all our sectors present significant opportunities in this regard
2853774 meanwhile our balance sheet is stronger than ever and we continue our bias towards lower risk alliance contracts and blue chip partners
2853775 organic growth from uniteds core engineering and property services businesses underpinned the result while us based facilities manager ugl unicco made a strong contribution
2853776 we remain well placed to benefit from record spending in essential infrastructure in the asia pacific region

2853779 the agreements mark the further evolution of the project the milestones are steadily being ticked off with mining and railing expected to commence in q4 2008 ahead of the first shipment in q1 2009
2853780 the government has its centrepiece building wa a package of infrastructure projects with such long lead times that many wont come to fruition until its time to vote again in another four years when victoria park mla ben wyatt is premier
2853781 it really requires the premier to come out immediately and clarify the situation
2853782 is ben wyatt the next in line during the next term is mr carpenter going to serve out the full term
2853783 mr halden does not say things like this unless theres truth to them
2853784 cpi inflation is expected to be higher in the short term at around five per cent in the december quarter reflecting the effects of higher petrol prices and the recent correction to estimates of financial services inflation before declining thereafter
2853785 nevertheless prices remain around 60 per cent above the average level in 2007 reflecting a combination of strong demand from developing countries a muted supply response and the depreciation of the us dollar
2853786 it is expected that the annual rate of cpi inflation will rise further in the september quarter in part due to the effect of higher petrol prices over the year
2853787 this extended period of high inflation is a reflection of the extent of price pressures evident in recent quarters
2853788 the june quarter data suggest that aggregate inflation may be levelling out but is yet to show an sign of easing
2853789 demand pressures in the economy now appear to be easing and the forecasts project a significant period of slower growth which will result in a moderation of capacity pressures
2853790 but even allowing for that both the cpi and underlying measures suggest that inflation has remained high
2853791 if the recent easing in demand is not as long lasting as the forecasts envisage or if the stimulus to domestic activity to the terms of trade causes demand to be stronger than expected the easing in inflation could be more modest than forecast
2853792 the impairment adjustments will flow through to our full year earnings and combined with the ongoing deterioration in global markets will mean that babcock amp browns 2008 earnings are now not expected to exceed 2007 group net profit of 643 million
2853793 we will look to provide more detail on the 2008 outlook with our interim result to be reported on 21 august 2008

2853850 we must condemn russias military assault on the sovereign state of georgia including the targeting of civilians and the campaign of terror against the georgian population
2853851 this is completely unacceptable especially from the lips of a representative of a country whose actions we are aware of in iraq afghanistan and serbia
2853852 regrettably i have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground within the council on a draft statement to the press
2853853 wir m ssen russland verurteilen den milit rischen angriff auf den souver nen staates georgien einschlie lich der ausrichtung von zivilisten und die kampagne des terrors gegen die georgische bev lkerung
2853854 dies ist v llig inakzeptabel vor allem aus dem munde des vertreters eines landes dessen aktionen die uns bekannt sind im irak in afghanistan und serbien
2853855 leider habe ich zu dem schluss gekommen dass es sehr schwierig wenn nicht gar unm glich zu finden gemeinsamkeiten im rat ber den entwurf einer erkl rung an die presse
2853856 die homepage selbst und dns server werden ziemlich hart angegriffen
2853857 die trag die in s dossetien zeigte die gefahr von zynismus und doppelstandards die leider einigen staaten eigen sind obwohl diese sich f r verantwortungsvolle mitglieder der internationalen gemeinschaft halten
2853858 erneut verhielt sich der westen seltsam in den ersten stunden nach der georgischen aggression hat er geschwiegen dann kritisierte er das russische vorgehen in s dossetien und zog dessen ziele in zweifel
2853859 wir m chten dass nicht nur russische panzer mit dem kommentar russland f hre einen krieg gegen georgien im westlichen fernsehen gezeigt werden h tte man das leiden des ossetischen volkes tote kinder und zerst rte ortschaften gezeigt so w re das eine objektive berichterstattung gewesen
2853860 nach den k mpfen haben wir entdeckt dass es viele menschen aus den baltischen staaten und der ukraine unter den angreifern gegeben hat
2853861 georgien hat s dossetien einer sehr z hen und zynischen aggression unterzogen russische staatsb rger kamen ums leben unter ihnen sowohl s dossetiens bewohner als auch friedenssoldaten
2853862 die formen die das georgische vorgehen annahm k nnen nur als v lkermord bezeichnet werden
2853863 beweise f r die in s dossetien begangenen verbrechen zu sammeln und zu dokumentieren um eine grundlage f r die strafverfolgung der t ter zu schaffen
2853864 sie trieben sie wie viehe zusammen verschlossen in einem haus und steckten es in brand wir sahen wir ein panzer an einem anderen ort eine alte frau berfahren hat die mit zwei kindern fliehen wollte wir sahen wie ein 1 5 j hriges kind erstochen wurde
2853865 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2853866 you have to get focused and give it a go
2853867 janet look out the window see that soft steady rain and how everything looks green that is what england looks like on a typical day
2853868 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2853869 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2853870 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2853871 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2853872 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2853873 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2853874 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2853875 we hope that there is no further bloodshed there has been too much bloodshed already
2853876 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2853877 it has to be condemned and the world needs to stand against it
2853878 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2853879 we have demonstrated that one dimensional 1d cylindrical nanofibers formed by self assembly of rationally designed molecules can associate laterally into two dimensional 2d ribbons triggered by aromatic guest molecules that act as a molecular glue
2853880 furthermore this reversible association leads to a macroscopic switching of bulk solutions from gel to fluid states compared to other self assembled 1d systems it is remarkable that our cylindrical fibers can be bound with one another in a lateral way by glue action of the guest molecules to form larger 2d aggregates in general supramolecular systems involving multiple assembling modules are hard to control
2853881 lateral association of cylindrical nanofibers into flat ribbons triggered by molecular glue
2853882 nanofibers with tunable stiffness from self assembly of an amphiphilic wedge coil molecule
2853883 in particular the formation of flexible coil like cylindrical aggregates in aqueous solution is attributed to the aggregation of branched hydrophobic chains into amorphous cylindrical cores
2853884 thus the addition of aromatic guest molecules into the hydrophobic core should force the y shaped aromatic segments which are radially distributed to be arranged in a more dense parallel packing and so bind the guest efficiently
2853885 the guest molecules could then be considered as molecular glue because they stick individual aromatic segments to one another which subsequently leads to the formation of larger aggregates
2853886 the micrograph of the unstained sample revealed ribbonlike aggregates with lengths of up to several micrometers
2853887 close examination of the samples revealed that the flat ribbons consist of laterally stacked elementary fibers the density profile perpendicular to the long axis of the ribbon showed an interfiber distance of about 18 nm which is consistent with the diameter of the single fibers this finding indicates that the cylindrical fibers are laterally associated into flat ribbons on addition of the aromatic guest
2853888 how did we veer so far off course how could they twist our words and intentions

2853899 were going to the fair well be near you do you want to meet up with us and do the fair we can get to spend some time together while the kids enjoy themselves
2853900 hmm this could be interesting and a way to make some positive changes in the good ol firm and breakfast will be served

2853925 we as believers can do more damage to our lord than any atheist dont tell em youre a believer until you want to act like a believer
2853926 the greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is christians who acknowledge jesus with their lips and then walk out the door and deny him by their lifestyle that is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable
2853927 if you dont believe in god you will find something else to believe in
2853928 only he who believes is obedient only he who is obedient believes
2853929 how are your beliefs changing growing or dissolving maturing or disintegrating hang on to the elements in your life that promote growth cut off activities and relationships that cause you to sin and replace them with ones that help you grow
2853930 that if you can confess with your mouth jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved

2853932 to know that its going to be my third year being the backup is frustrating
2853933 but i got to take it in stride and just got to go with it hopefully my time comes because hes carpenter the guy right now and i got to support him
2853934 because i dont know how many people have told me that well shame on you ill take it as a real personal issue because ill strive off that if you think that
2853935 this is his carpenter time and its his time to take that final step of building this program
2853936 but i got to do whats best for the team because i cant think about myself
2853937 thats entered my mind many times but i just dont feel like we can do that
2853938 something happens hes sullivan heads and shoulders the no 2 quarterback
2853939 you watch a team play and say why were they 5 6
2853940 you go back and see they lost two in ot they had a key player get hurt always look for a team that lost games they could have won
2853941 if west virginia beat us by four touchdowns no one is even talking about us
2853942 one thing i think and believe is hes a pretty quick healer
2853943 i went to turn up and i just couldnt do what i normally did
2853944 ronnie did a great job thursday coming in did a great job running the offense
2853945 we wont really miss anything there those guys respect him and he has control of the huddle
2853946 weve talked about a two quarterback system and we knew this would be coming not quite in this form but we knew we wanted to develop ronnie so this is a blessing in a sense and also allows us to give locker a little bit of rest
2853947 the fans of oregon and the citizens of oregon fly boeing planes they shop at costco and they buy microsoft products
2853948 this puts us with elite bcs schools its hard to compare apparel and equipment contracts because its apples and oranges in most cases but we were very pleased with the monetary and product pieces of the deal
2853949 friday in the middle of practice we asked him to change shirts take off your gloves get rid of all your junk like wristbands take off all that stuff off and get back to quarterback
2853950 we told him when he came here that this could happen
2853951 its cool it is fun getting back into it though i havent thought like a quarterback in a while
2853952 its a blast and what i have been doing for years obviously rusty doesnt being to describe my play but it is a blast and i am having a lot of fun
2853953 i felt better than i thought but it is kind of a double edged sword
2853954 i think a lot of the reason i was doing better was because i didnt have the entire mental part of it to think about whether that is a good thing or bad thing yet i dont know
2853955 i completed a few balls and i am having fun running around with these guys and filling in where i can
2853956 just understanding the entire route running stuff and what is going on in their head it definitely helps
2853957 he has a longer background in knowing the offense and knowing the terminology and all of that stuff
2853958 he is very comfortable calling the plays in the huddle and he is a good athlete we are lucky to have him jump in there
2853959 i dont know if that will get me up in the starting position
2853960 we are working with the amazing team at wildstorm so that both the artists work and the physical book itself will be reflective of the storys place and time

2853964 why should we go to war over a land so far away about which we know nothing
2853965 the american dream find something that you love that youre good at you twist and you torture it and you try to find a way to make money at it you spend a lifetime doing it and in the end you cant find a trace of what you started out loving
2853966 like the 747 that carries the space shuttle back to florida when they have to land in white sands
2853967 i like operating on librarians when you open them up everything is in alphabetical order
2853968 i like operating on accountants when you open them up everything is in numerical order
2853969 i like operating on electricians when you open them up everything is color coded
2853970 because they are heartless gutless spineless and their ass and head are interchangeable
2853971 it sounded like it was the exact same thing as last spring he was carrying out a fake he said it was not as bad as last spring the pain was not the same well see what that means
2853972 it will change the course no question it has to
2853973 but its too early to talk about that norm and i and all the offensive coaches will have to sit down and develop a plan figure out what happened and what needs to be done
2853974 i usually dont get too involved he must have thought chris was doing well and let him stay in there and gain some confidence
2853975 i dont want to get too far out over our skis
2853976 we want to wait and see what happened with olson
2853977 we got to keep chugging along as the sands drifts through the hourglass weve got to make some decisions well just have to wait and see what those decisions are when we have all the information
2853978 i wasnt sick or anything but there was something going on with my stomach i couldnt hold anything down i saw 100 million doctors and they havent quite figured it out they put me on some medicine so i can hold liquid down

2853982 after that they will be required to actively look for a job go to any job interview they are referred to and accept any suitable offer of employment if they dont comply with these obligations their benefits will be reduced in the first instance then suspended then cancelled
2853983 national also wants appropriate incentives in the benefit system so those on benefits actually want to work national will therefore make the benefit abatement regime more generous
2853984 i see theyve got the hoary old beat up on single parents miss clark said on tv ones breakfast programme
2853985 ive got one view on that whatever we do with single parents we have got to be guided by what is in the best interest of the children and its not always in the best interest of every child that mum is at work all day
2853986 and the truth is most people on the dpb are not there for very long
2853987 im all in favour of supporting single parents to get into work but in the final analysis we have to be guided by what is in the best interest of the children in a particular family
2853988 the secret of a long life is drugs and fucking
2853989 jets bombed targets near tbilisi including the airport and russia said its warships had sunk a georgian boat that approached and tried to attack russia earlier took control of the breakaway region of south ossetia forcing georgian troops to withdraw

2853997 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2853998 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2853999 my wife was a wonderful person and didnt deserve this i fell for a coed it was stupid i sit in my cell and think how the heck did i get here but i was a willing participant you can call it lust i really thought i would get off like a lot of people who are deluded
2854000 he was a government servant the hospital should not have charged me as jayabalan died while carrying out his duty as a policeman
2854001 all mans miseries derive from not being able to sit quietly in a room alone
2854002 i thought i was going to die it was unbelievable the house shifted the front door its a solid wooden door its in pieces
2854003 we are asking people to take medication take any pets you may have in your home anything that you require for today
2854004 i am the true vine and my father is the gardener
2854005 it was one of those bizarre accidents in its truest form
2854006 when i got there the victim was lying down unresponsive but breathing
2854007 the world is a dangerous place to live not because of the people who are evil but because of the people who dont do anything about it
2854008 yeah i like watching athletes compete and enjoy the olympics
2854009 ultimately they will become empty mindless spectres stripped of will and soul only their thirst for freedom gives them hunger for vengeance
2854010 three quarters of a soldiers life is spent in aimlessly waiting about
2854011 i dont think we have to worry about invisible people walking around any time soon to be honest we are just at the beginning of doing anything like that
2854012 in naturally occurring material the index of refraction a measure of how light bends in a medium is positive
2854013 when you see a fish in the water the fish will appear to be in front of the position it really is or if you put a stick in the water the stick seems to bend away from you
2854014 instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water it would actually appear to be above the waters surface
2854015 what we have done is taken that material and made it much thicker
2854016 however cloaking may be something that this material could be used for in the future
2854017 youd have to wrap whatever you wanted to cloak in the material it would just send light around by sending light around the object that is to be cloaked you dont see it
2854018 drivin in my pick up truck and im on my way to hell
2854019 we have eight or nine more potential victims that we know of now
2854020 they broke the roof tiles and proceeded to the vault on the ground floor they left the same way with the stolen jewellery
2854021 there was a hole in the wall leading into the vault
2854022 we have several potentially big customers say they wont use puppet gt because of the gpl
2854023 however they have said that they gt would work with us if we had a bsd style license
2854024 we dont have any customers who say they wouldnt work with us if we gt were bsd instead of gpl we do have many who say they wouldnt if we gt were gpl instead of bsd for us we would prefer for a license to be gt less controversial not more
2854025 this should be translated into bumiputera involvement together with other races in the development of economic corridors
2854026 we also want to maintain and increase bumiputera property ownership besides raising their value
2854027 my door is always open for new views and ideas
2854028 at the same time we need to make kuala lumpur a city with its own unique flavours making it a good place to live in
2854029 this can be done by having more malays owning factories and getting involved in property holdings
2854030 whoop it up for the ragged trousers put the lazy greasy fizzle who cant pay his debts on the altar and bow down and worship him let the state ideal be high what we need is not the respect of our fellow men but the chance to get something for nothing

2854032 he gave a prized car a ferrari with his racing number 82 on it to a long time pal
2854033 the sudden move angered his children its especially hard for them to come to grips with whats going on

2854035 it is totally different to the open i was very confident in the open

2854046 this is another effort by the government to help contractors by reviewing the old prices quoted in the contracts
2854047 usually signed contracts cannot be reviewed but in the light of the abnormal situation today the government has agreed to do so
2854048 it is impractical to give one what we can do is to review existing contracts
2854049 some are on an ego trip and forget the agenda to strengthen the bumiputera players in the sector
2854050 when you witness any wrongdoing or slacking off tell us so that the government can intervene before things get worse
2854051 theres even a little caf where you can sit and eat im pretty sure they have vegan options too

2854053 the bad thing is he has to cover me the good is he can save 15 percent by switching his
2854054 our aim is to turn tanjung aru into the first litter free town the best thing about this effort is it was initiated by the people
2854055 we want to drive the message home to the residents of tanjung aru and visitors that we are serious about our intentions and we have the support of all quarters
2854056 umno has to look into its weaknesses and not repeat the same mistakes to ensure our struggles have a positive effect on the party
2854057 that is why i have suggested before that members who are contesting should be given space to explain their vision and mission this will give a clearer understanding at the grassroots level
2854058 instead they should find ways to forge political stability or national policies that benefit the country
2854059 umno and pas can meet but prior to their meetings there must be discussions with bn component parties and pakatan rakyat
2854060 it is vital for government and political parties to draw up a national agenda to unite the nation to face the challenges ahead especially given the current economic situation
2854061 it was evident in the elections that people do not want leaders fuelling racial feelings for political mileage
2854062 this style of politics has kept us divided for 51 years and that is why we want bn to amend its constitution to disband all component parties and form a single party so that no one would champion the interests of a single community
2854063 if bn is constantly blamed for mistakes it would only be a matter of time before the people lose confidence in prs ability to deliver
2854064 the deceased had not reported for duty at the state police headquarters since thursday and his wife lodged a missing persons report on saturday
2854065 he was one of the police personnel whose statements were recorded to assist investigations into the drug theft case we have recorded 52 statements from police personnel for the investigation
2854066 a full report will be submitted to inspector general of police tan sri musa hassan soon
2854067 i did not notice anything strange about him before his disappearance although the night before he did say to me that he would never leave me and the children
2854068 the two suspects both 21 are probationary constables and have been in the force since 2006
2854069 we bocog promised free access except for a few websites that jeopardise our security and the healthy growth of our youth
2854070 thats an assessment made by the authorities of which sites are good and which are not good for our youth its like what any other country does
2854071 however the other day i was asked would i apologise and i said i would not apologise as the ioc do not run the internet in china
2854072 i categorically deny that we ever made such an offer but we are willing to cooperate with pas if the leadership of both parties agree to work together
2854073 some of our friends like to twist our statements although they wear robes
2854074 actually i didnt adopt any specific measures i think just the training was important
2854075 i will make it up to my family being absent for training especially my daughter
2854076 i lost to park by less than one second but ive tried my best
2854077 i dont think ive reached the same level as the other swimmers yet
2854078 generally we find that foreign trained graduates are more likely to possess the attributes we look for possibly because they have to be more independent and are exposed to a whole new culture they also have to learn to adapt when they live overseas
2854079 we did it it was perfect its a dream come true
2854080 normally im good in the rain but the problem was that it was really cold
2854081 i am satisfied with my performance today yesterday and we are both very happy because we are on home soil in china we are very proud to have won
2854082 its so exciting having our own people cheer for us and hopefully there will be more to celebrate in the coming days
2854083 i am not thinking of life after these games everything i do is focused on winning here
2854084 i am pleased with the result it was different diving here with anastasia compared to vera but i am pleased with the way it went
2854085 in the paddock right beside humphrey hes the roan with the brown socks
2854086 if you stay close to the horse he cant kick you because he cant wind up
2854087 the continued growth of online advertising demonstrates a growing confidence in the medium and importantly shows the increasing inclusion of online advertising in marketers strategic plans
2854088 all segments search display and classifieds continue to grow significantly and the combined total surpassing 1 5 billion for the first time is testament to the strength of the industry here in australia
2854089 to achieve a growth rate of 27 per cent year on year indicates the growing importance of online advertising in the media mix
2854090 there is still much work to be done however to educate and inform key industries yet to fully embrace online advertising in particular fast moving consumer goods retail and government on the effectiveness online advertising plays not only in direct response but also in branding
2854091 advertisers can continue to invest confidently in online advertising knowing their target audience is spending more of their time online and that online advertising offers a cost effective platform to reach and engage with them
2854092 with advertising expenditure exceeding 1 5 billion over a 12 month period for the first time strong growth can be seen across all markets segments
2854093 it appears the banks debt will not be paid from the sale of the assets
2854094 the banks will suffer a substantial deficiency and therefore theres no chance of creditors getting a dividend hence shareholders will not have any likelihood of a return
2854095 still hopeful that we could craft a solution that would meet with the approval of the banks
2854096 time was against us despite everyones best efforts we just couldnt get enough of the turnaround happening fast enough
2854097 but we did give it a red hot go i did also say that whilst there were no guarantees of success that you had my 100 per cent commitment and that of the whole executive team that if we didnt get there it wouldnt be from lack of hard work
2854098 i believe these were the workers who worked at the sites and stayed on after the project finished
2854099 the paths were probably there to connect the villages in the area in the olden days but these days i dont even dare to let my grandchildren out from the house for fear of being harmed by the foreigners
2854100 i dont think its in telstras interest to be seen to be the company thats still trying to implement work choices
2854101 in a democracy people who want to be a member of a union then the union has got the right to represent them and companies right across the country should recognise that
2854102 we simply want everyone who wants an opportunity to be on a performance based contract to have that opportunity
2854103 theres no need to have someone between us and the employee so this is not about awas or unions its really about how a modern company relates to their employees and if people want to work harder they can make more money
2854104 if someone is trying to squeeze the bitter lemon of work choices its not us
2854105 it will certainly say to telstra and to other companies that if a majority of the employees want to try collectively bargaining then the employer has to join them at the bargaining table and have a go at it in good faith
2854106 so far all the department heads have been very accommodating they give me work which helps to build up my learning experience
2854107 they are not confined to a specific area of work which means that they can experience the full depth and breadth of the business an opportunity they may not have if they pursue their careers in a larger foreign bank
2854108 it will give employers the impression that you have the initiative and drive to pick up some relevant and useful work experience in your free time on top of the obvious credentials on the cv it may also give you something to talk about in the interview room
2854109 i used to stay with relatives but i moved out when they asked me to pay rent
2854110 before that my family lived in a rakit house boat house but it was swept away during the floods in 1971
2854111 they said i must own a piece of land before i can get the cash aid to build a house
2854112 i rent this chicken coop for rm50 a month but there are times when the owner does not ask for the rent
2854113 the end is upon us the prince will spare no one
2854114 the new blackberry 20029 for at amp t is the only cell phone that allows you to control your car from inside your house
2854115 well why should i buy this from you when as soon as i leave this mall im going to go kill myself
2854116 its like being in a swimming pool with the warm places you discover by accident
2854117 i have to find out where they are coming from
2854118 its an old building it might be in the foundation or something
2854119 i cant find it i cant follow the drafts theyre too irregular
2854120 cant make it this cold can you you precocious whore
2854121 sometimes my father packs sandwiches or noodles for me to eat during recess
2854122 we teach them that everything has to be taken in moderation with more emphasis on having three square meals a day and cutting down on snacks such as ice cream
2854123 i prefer wholesale markets as i can buy ikan kembung there for rm5 a kg compared with rm7 80 at the shops here

2854126 we have applied for a preliminary environmental license said a spokeswoman for the melbourne based company bhp is planning a 900m terminal that could
2854127 we knew we had to explode into the water and see what happens
2854128 we were hoping to win it but we never like that
2854129 i had never met libby trickett before she just looked so young and innocent with this big smile
2854130 over the past three weeks i have started to give my family more vegetables and fruits like rambutan oranges and banana my two sons mohd afiq azli 13 and mohd awaluddin 10 are finding it difficult but they are slowly adapting to it
2854131 when i do not serve vegetables or fruits they will now ask for them
2854132 i will try my best to buy more fruits and vegetables and have identified mydins dry items and the gok kapor and kampung cina wet markets in kota baru for meat fish and other groceries
2854133 eating right is as important as exercising and i will make sure my family does not miss it
2854134 the fortune teller told me if you change your name you will win the gold
2854135 some people believe in fortune tellers and i am one of them so i followed her advice
2854136 but it was not only down to luck i trained hard for this
2854137 what happens next depends on bam i want to continue playing but a decision on what role i should play depends on bam who knows they may not want older players in the programme anymore
2854138 we are so disappointed as we really wanted to do well i suppose this was the reason why we looked so ill at ease in the first game
2854139 finally we start to see his smile not everybody knows that he hadnt played an official game for four months but a talented player like him will retrieve his form very fast
2854140 there has been a lot of comment regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
2854141 this is not about questioning the managers judgment or the ability of a particular player
2854142 the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
2854143 i thought we could have won it sometimes you win sometimes you lose they came back they hit a great shot give them credit
2854144 it was great we won the game we really feel good about that but there is still a long way to go
2854145 we cant get too rattled in the beginning with good streaks
2854146 if we get worried it wont help us we have to keep that in mind from here on out
2854147 everyone is proud it felt great all the flags and people cheering it was a great game great atmosphere
2854148 uitm was set up to uplift malays and bumiputeras from sabah and sarawak in the education sector this effort must continue

2854153 we need major changes in the first team and everywhere
2854154 i am not going to change my lifestyle and activity
2854155 i wasnt comfortable with that close a race i normally have more of a gap
2854156 i made my breaststroke a bit stronger and the freestyle was all downhill
2854157 i know i didnt win anything but the new national record will motivate me to work harder it has been a long journey to get back and now that i am on track i just want to go on
2854158 it was a hard two years and i know that i havent achieved anything yet but i have to start somewhere and the olympics is where my career is reborn
2854159 weve got a wage structure at west brom and the players all understand that
2854160 its a philosophy i try to have and it wont be broken
2854161 hopefully the bigger picture is we do well this year and this time next season we are adding again and continually improving
2854162 weve got to hit the ground running come aug 16
2854163 weve got to be fitter than any other team we come up against because we know we havent quite got the quality of other teams
2854164 its going to be tough but i think the club are geared to stay in the premier league and thats why im here i believe that

2854169 all i am thinking about now is just getting better mentally getting better physically and going through rehab with a 100 percent positive attitude and coming back better than i was
2854170 hes fitting in well and i have said this before but hes a really good kid he is a humble guy who has his feet on the ground
2854171 but i am trying my best to get used to the altitude and improve everyday
2854172 but at the same time we all want that spot
2854173 but it is also my job to help them get better we are all helping each other we all want to be the best running back corps in the country
2854174 are they going to go out and take a 12 yard curl and go 80 yards for a touchdown probably not
2854175 but they are just good solid guys i know i can count on them they will be productive and make plays
2854176 my knee has been giving out on me a little bit every time i kick
2854177 hes got quick feet fluid hips and he never stops hes always going forward
2854178 he had a five yard run friday morning with probably six or seven cuts and no one touched him
2854179 coaches thought i would work best there and help the team and thats what im doing
2854180 obviously those tackles are going to have to be made by someone else now but i dont think that necessarily has to be one person i think those tackles will get distributed among the defense
2854181 the group as a whole is further along as an incoming class than probably any group ive ever had
2854182 but theyre not really rookies they have a lot of game experience its just that now they have to step up to a starting role
2854183 theres a palpable air of confidence you might even call it swagger that hasnt been felt around the dal ward center for a few years
2854184 it was really hard to shoot in the rain but there is nothing we can do about it because we cant change the weather
2854185 i felt a little nervous and a little disappointed but finishing fourth is always better than fifth
2854186 this medal is good for georgia especially in times like these

2854194 if you were going to use this type of material for a cloak yes it would bend around the material
2854195 what weve been able to do is make bulk material which bends light the opposite to that of how it bends with naturally occurring materials
2854196 so for example in the fish in the water scenario if the water was a medium with a negative index of a fraction the fish would actually appear to be above the water
2854197 what weve done is taken this single layer and weve been able to stack the material making a bulk material thats relatively thick
2854198 weve found that by making that material thicker we actually can reduce the loss so less light is absorbed in the material
2854199 so this can really enable the vice applications one of those applications could potentially be creating this cloaking
2854200 if you were able to engineer the material properties in a certain manner and you wrapped someone in this material thats been designed the person would essentially be invisible in that the light would bend around the person so you wouldnt see them at all
2854201 we werent concentrating on any of the applications well see where we it goes from here and what we pursue with it
2854202 it was the first score in our olympic campaign here at home and ill always remember it it represents that we can keep our heads up in the face of really tough odds

2854220 the evidence to date is that a significant moderation in demand is now occurring and it is looking more likely the demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead
2854221 while inflation is likely to remain high in the short term the board judged at its august meeting that demand was slowing to an extent that could be expected to bring about a significant reduction in inflation over time
2854222 on this basis the board decided that the existing monetary policy setting was appropriate for the time being
2854223 on the assumption that the subdued demand conditions are like to continue scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing
2854224 the combination of falls in housing and equity prices means that household net wealth has declined in the first half of this year

2854242 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2854243 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected

2854245 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2854246 in the white community the path to a more perfect union means acknowledging that what ails the african american community does not just exist in the minds of black people that the legacy of discrimination and current incidents of discrimination while less overt than in the past are real and must be addressed not just with words but with deeds by investing in our schools and our communities by enforcing our civil rights laws and ensuring fairness in our criminal justice system by providing this generation with ladders of opportunity that were unavailable for previous generations it requires all americans to realize that your dreams do not have to come at the expense of my dreams that investing in the health welfare and education of black and brown and white children will ultimately help all of america prosper
2854247 i can no more disown him than i can disown the black community i can no more disown him than i can my white grandmother a woman who helped raise me a woman who sacrificed again and again for me a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe these people are a part of me and they are a part of america this country that i love some will see this as an attempt to justify or excuse comments that are simply inexcusable i can assure you it is not i suppose the politically safe thing would be to move on from this episode and just hope that it fades into the woodwork we can dismiss reverend wright as a crank or a demagogue just as some have dismissed geraldine ferraro in the aftermath of her recent statements as harboring some deep seated racial bias but race is an issue that i believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now we would be making the same mistake that reverend wright made in his offending sermons about america to simplify and stereotype and amplify the negative to the point that it distorts reality the fact is that the comments that have been made and the issues that have surfaced over the last few weeks reflect the complexities of race in this country that weve never really worked through a part of our union that we have yet to perfect and if we walk away now if we simply retreat into our respective corners we will never be able to come together and solve challenges like health care or education or the need to find good jobs for every american

2854303 with cloud computer looming on the horizon it is important for us all to think of the privacy threats there as well
2854304 the tool resides with someone else and the data is stored somewhere else generally that is a bad idea

2854334 a equipe at que estava bem e fizemos o gol no primeiro tempo tivemos mais oportunidades claras para acabar com o jogo mas infelizmente isso n o aconteceu no come o do segundo tempo perdemos o fabinho expulso jogar 11 contra 11 j dif cil e com um a menos fica ainda mais infelizmente em poucos minutos levamos os dois gols da virada
2854335 n o vou ficar acusando jogador aqui todo mundo ganha e todo mundo perde era importante essa vit ria para n s e tivemos a chance de matar no primeiro tempo mas n o fizemos no segundo o ipatinga cresceu bastante perdemos um jogo que estava em nossas m os e temos de trabalhar
2854336 n s nos comportamos bem no primeiro tempo mas n o conseguimos aumentar a vantagem no segundo tempo infelizmente levamos os dois gols temos de trabalhar durante a semana para pensar no atl tico mg
2854337 est vamos bem no jogo mas no segundo tempo o time deles veio para cima com um jogador a mais era um jogo de seis pontos que poderia nos deixar mais perto da sa da da zona do rebaixamento mas n s perdemos
2854338 dif cil porque jogar com um a menos complicado o fluminense tentou jogar forte desde o come o mas infelizmente n o conseguimos segurar o resultado
2854339 o cart o do elder granja foi normal o do vald via foi muito infantil foi um cart o de gra a e trar preju zos ao palmeiras n o a primeira vez que isso acontece e ele est fora de novo
2854340 antes do jogo avisei que o rbitro n o costumava marcar muitas faltas e pedi para ningu m reclamar o vald via ficou reclamando e prejudicou a equipe
2854341 estou precisando tomar decis es mais duras preciso acabar com isso o que n o pode o vald via ficar prejudicando o palmeiras em v rios jogos n o tenho d vida que vou conseguir controlar essa situa o
2854342 tomamos uma chacoalhada do professor e tiramos a vit ria l de dentro suamos sangue
2854343 jogamos bem contra o gr mio e em outras ocasi es mas n o vencemos por detalhes no futebol n o se pode pecar nos detalhes era isso que a gente estava precisando
2854344 no intervalo eu falei que a gente estava no jogo o professor deu uma sacudida no grupo e fomos buscar o resultado sem d vida o professor foi bem demais chamou a responsabilidade para cada um e est de parab ns
2854345 v nhamos jogando bem mas infelizmente a vit ria n o estava acontecendo hoje domingo jogamos bem de novo e a torcida nos apoiou at a vit ria
2854346 muito dif cil jogar contra o internacional no beira rio fica mais dif cil com erros do juiz com ele nos prejudicando mas a arbitragem n o comigo a cbf que avalia
2854347 aposto no crescimento da equipe para buscar uma vaga na libertadores com a entrada dos novos jogadores e com o tempo com eles criando ritmo de jogo d para a equipe crescer ao longo da competi o
2854348 hoje a gente n o foi bem talvez tenha sido a nica partida que a gente n o tinha a alma de uma equipe campe neste campeonato
2854349 sabemos que h jogadores no elenco para tirar o santos dessa situa o se fosse o contr rio seria pior mas tem que ir com calma sem partir para cima dos advers rios de qualquer forma
2854350 hoje o time n o apresentou um futebol t o bonito mas n o foi inferior ao n utico eles aproveitaram uma jogada de bola parada e foram mais felizes mas acho que o empate seria mais justo
2854351 eu sou funcion rio do clube e sinceramente n o me preocupo com as fofocas j assumi o time em outras oportunidades e dessa vez foi assim fui chamado e aceitei porque sou funcion rio do santos
2854352 o pierre vai voltar para s o paulo amanh segunda feira n o tem raz o para ele ficar aqui rio de janeiro se n o tem condi es de jogar na sul americana uma pena ele sentir esta entorse no joelho mas espero que n o seja grave
2854353 quando o jogador vem de problemas pessoais graves geralmente est mais sujeito a les es escalei o pierre para ajudar nesse momento dif cil
2854354 o botafogo tem um dos melhores meio campos do brasileiro eles jogam certinho estavam dominando o setor com o pierre a produ o do palmeiras cresceu e a marca o melhorou mas quando ele saiu o martinez deixou espa os de novo
2854355 sou privilegiado por ter jogado quatro finais da nba e mais uma s rie de outros grandes jogos mas isso foi diferente voc sente que tem muito mais apoio porque eram os estados unidos e obviamente os torcedores t m muito orgulho de seu pa s
2854356 voc entende que tem algo a mais que maior do que o jogo n o apenas um jogo de final ou mesmo um s timo e decisivo jogo mais que isso
2854357 eu enterrei cinco vezes em um jogo na ltima fez que eu que enterrei cinco bolas em um jogo tinha 17 anos foi por causa da energia da torcida dava para sentir a eletricidade foi sensacional
2854358 acho que eles sabiam que a hist ria estava sendo constru da esta noite certamente foi um momento de orgulho para o pa s deles e voc sentia a eletricidade
2854359 foi muito bom ele basicamente veio e nos disse que estava l para nos apoiar que nosso pa s torce por n s ent o saiam e chutem alguns traseiros
2854360 ouvir isso coloca as coisas em outra perspectiva voc olha na torcida e v outros atletas americanos te apoiando depois voc vai nas competi es deles para torcer como uma irmandade
2854361 temos jogos dif ceis pela frente mas ainda d para ser l der
2854362 temos que ir passo a passo vencendo na tabela e agora vamos enfrentar times com os quais eu acho que melhor jogar fora de casa como s o paulo gr mio porque eles t m que sair para ir para a cima
2854363 sabemos que desde que come aram os pontos corridos o campe o do primeiro turno acabou sendo campe o no final do brasileiro mas esse ano est bem embolado todo mundo perto na tabela e estamos quebrando v rios tabus ent o vale a pena quebrar mais esse para ser campe o
2854364 n o precis vamos daquilo lance de eduardo ele foi infeliz na jogada mas o importante que antes daquele lance tivemos duas oportunidades absurdas de gol e superioridade total infelizmente tomamos alguns sustos e pecamos nas finaliza es mas a gente sabe qual o peso que estes jogadores carregavam o importante que sa mos com a vit ria
2854365 o mais importante foi voltar a vencer pois est vamos h oito rodadas sem vit ria e mais ainda conseguimos sair da zona de rebaixamento agora o que temos que fazer procurar corrigir nossas falhas e dar seq ncia essa rea o o importante agora seguirmos bem porque na s rie a n o adianta vencer um jogo e perder outro tem que manter uma boa seq ncia
2854366 at j me acostumei a tomar gols assim o jogador vai at a linha de fundo e cruza sab amos que o jorge henrique era perigoso nesses cruzamentos e vacilamos na marca o de novo tentei participar da jogada mas a bola veio no segundo pau o z carlos estava sozinho e fez o gol
2854367 nosso time s joga bem em casa no segundo turno vamos tentar fazer fora de casa o que n o fizemos no primeiro temos que recuperar os pontos perdidos
2854368 quase n o tivemos presen a ofensiva e o nosso forte o ataque dif cil s se defender o jogo todo quem sofresse o primeiro gol perderia quem vacila n o merece ganhar
2854369 e n o podemos tirar os m ritos do botafogo que teve um sistema defensivo muito bom e fez a gente quase n o chegar l se tinha que ter um vencedor tinha que ser o botafogo
2854370 criamos pouco marcamos bem mas infelizmente tomamos o gol em uma jogada de lateral m rito deles

2854374 these results demonstrate the continued rise of the greens in australian politics
2854375 it also demonstrates the greens are a credible alternative to the two old parties as voters increasingly embrace the policies and energy of the greens
2854376 nearly 80 per cent of people do their shopping in supermarkets
2854377 although native flavours are starting to appear in chutneys sauces and spice blends you wont find crocodile meat in the cold cabinet or lemon myrtle on the spice rack let alone fresh warrigal greens or kakadu plums alongside the salad mix and packham pears
2854378 theres a difference between experiencing something unique once and putting it on the weekly shopping list
2854379 research shows that we gravitate to flavours that taste the most familiar
2854380 with such conservative palates australians are not going to embrace challenging new native flavours
2854381 the last thing i wanted to do was walk that guy
2854382 it was the perfect time for us because of our situation where were at

2854387 for these guys that are in contention theres nothing better than to do that they did it to us in 04
2854388 the intensity that was here in this series and the crowd you could hear them even when we came in after the eighth the sense and feel in the dugout was hey we can do this theyre fighting and thats all you can ask
2854389 its a feeling of if we dont get something started were going to find ourselves in a long september just being so far behind that were not even playing for anything
2854390 we had an opportunity to make something happen with someone in front of us right in our own yard
2854391 were going to have to reach down and reach back its how you come back
2854392 ive said it before there were times i didnt know if i was going to be playing anymore i honestly didnt know
2854393 there were some scary times too those are all behind me now hopefully i came out of it feeling good and im just really really happy now
2854394 to be able to get back to the big leagues its special
2854395 its not about him playing right field and getting a hit today its just the matter of him getting back out getting back in the fray and i think thats going to in the long haul benefit him in a lot of different ways
2854396 you cant really look at what we dont have you have to look at what we do have and the guys that we do have can produce
2854397 i dont know why but ill say nothing right now

2854415 pertama alifia saya bawa ke rumah sakit budi kemuliaan di dekat monas jalan budi kemuliaan red tapi tidak ada perubahaan terus dia saya bawa ke rumah lagi dan dirawat oleh dokter yang tinggal di dekat rumah
2854416 saat itu kami diminta untuk membayar uang muka rp 10 juta demi kesembuhan cucu kami saya pun mencari pinjaman untuk bayar uang muka tersebut
2854417 tapi setelah semalam dirawat di icu rsab harapan kita kondisi alifia tidak juga membaik bahkan kondisinya semakin buruk dokter yang memeriksanya menyatakan kondisi alifia sudah berada di bawa koma
2854418 semalam dirawat di sana sudah ada biaya tambahan rp 3 juta itu hanya untuk nebus obat kami jadi bingung
2854419 tapi mengingat biaya besar yang harus dikeluarkan kami pun memutuskan untuk membawa pulang alifia apalagi kalau tidak ada biaya dokter juga tidak mau merawatnya
2854420 waktu berada di dalam mobil kondisi anak saya sudah kaku tidak ada napas badannya pun biru matanya merem
2854421 lalu ada orang yang mengerti kesehatan datang untuk memeriksa orang itu menyatakan alifia masih hidup
2854422 apa penyakitnya kami tidak tahu mengapa dibawa pulang paksa kami juga tidak tahu silakan hubungi pejabat yang berwenang pada hari senin
2854423 benar kami menangkap oknum lurah dan caleg tersebut karena kami mendapat laporan bahwa kedua orang itu sering menggunakan narkoba bahkan informasi lain yang kami terima kedua orang itu juga mengedarkan narkoba jenis ekstasi dan sabu sabu
2854424 this is a big wake up call for mr rudd
2854425 this is an extraordinary swing and it underlines the disillusionment australians are seeing and feeling with the lack of leadership from the new federal labor government a government that promised so much
2854426 last year kevin 07 was everywhere dripping with empathy draping himself across petrol station forecourts shopping centre aisles promising to stop prices going up
2854427 and all weve got is one watch after another fuelwatch grocerywatch and who knows what the next watch exercise will be
2854428 he promised action and delivered nothing thats why australians are so disillusioned

2854431 obviously generally the public says to politicians they want them to serve their term and get the job done
2854432 but circumstances can bring early elections on and thats whats happened in western australia
2854433 nevertheless when elections come and go theres always a lesson for politicians in them
2854434 given that car insurance premiums are rising and the cost of driving is now at its highest for a number of years it is all the more important for motorists to shop around for competitive insurance
2854435 however accepting a lower premium does not mean that you have to sacrifice quality cover by shopping around you can find both just make sure when comparing car insurance policies that you do this on a like for like basis
2854436 a total of 60 per cent of car insurance is bought through comparison websites which can search for the cheapest deals the older generation are less likely to use such sites

2854489 in hindsight that information was confidential i admit but at the time i was just trying to explain the actual as opposed to perceived situation which to my mind both then and now was in the public interest
2854490 i believed i was revealing not confidential negotiations but the result of those negotiations only which in the instance of council selling public land i believe the community has a right to know
2854491 my only defence in mitigation is that it was not a deliberate breach of confidentiality but an unintentional error made during an off the cuff interview that i was unable to adequately prepare for
2854492 the only people who have raised any concern about this matter have been other councillors one of whom no doubt made this complaint so i dont believe any harm has been done
2854493 if the complaint had come from huscorp i might have been more concerned
2854494 this to my mind amounts to a politically motivated vexatious complaint
2854495 i believe this action is out of proportion and inconsistent with other actions and decisions by council on matters of conduct
2854496 im not an expert but i would be very surprised if we dont have a location here possibly further south behind st georges basin
2854497 i think we need to enter ourselves into the discussions
2854498 requires a council that doesnt think we have to sell ourselves short
2854499 if elected as mayor one of the first things i will do is talk to the coordinator general of nsw who has 50 billion to spend on infrastructure we need to get our voice heard
2854500 this is not something that can be achieved in four years nor is it something local government can do itself
2854501 but it will not happen without a local government with 2020 vision it cannot happen on one persons endorsement it needs to have the endorsement of the community

2854505 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2854506 my whole room lights up orange and i look out i live on the top floor so i had a perfect view and i just seen a huge ball of flame hundreds of metres in the sky big black pillars of smoke
2854507 we got freaked out my family woke up they thought it was a plane that went down
2854508 it wasnt impacted by anything it was just in the course of him performing some operations that he went down
2854509 i dont know of any pre existing medical conditions that could have contributed to this tragic accident
2854510 im sure that all of our all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2854511 there was a very very large amount of fire when we arrived and the extent of the explosion if the blast was heard as far away as it was could have been much more serious
2854512 hopefully we wont find that there are a lot of people missing or injured but so far it looks like we got off very lucky
2854513 the person who we described as being unaccounted for i believe is someone who was an employee of the business where the explosion took place
2854514 so efforts continue to try to track down that person
2854515 he was going to check on my parents but the explosions were getting louder and louder so the three of us just ran and ran and ran
2854516 everyone was just running down the street it was like something from a movie
2854517 we were concerned when this company moved at the end of the street
2854518 but we werent even advised that they were going to be there they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen
2854519 to determine if any of the regulations were not followed
2854520 i want to see it gone i want to see them compensate our neighbourhood for the damage theyve caused us and the fear theyve caused our children
2854521 they should have realized dont put something like that in a residential area youre going to kill somebody
2854522 my concern today is the safety of the torontonians who live in the vicinity and the safety of our emergency service workers and the workers at the propane facility
2854523 it was inevitable something like this was going to happen it was just a matter of time
2854524 excellent safety record and incidents like this are an extremely rare occurrence

2854536 we remain well placed to benefit from record spending in essential infrastructure in the asia pacific region ongoing growth in the australian resources sector and the global trend for outsourcing of non core services

2854566 unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
2854567 to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war
2854568 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
2854569 unfortunately we have seen in recent days russia demonstrate that these concerns were well founded
2854570 i think this is another example during these uncertain times where we need experienced leadership
2854571 we need somebody like senator mccain who will take a stronger view a more experienced view when it comes to international security and protecting americas interest
2854572 the problem though is that we dont have the kind of influence and strength in our relationship with russia to persuade them

2854581 employing self service applications provides a staggering cost benefit to organisations simultaneously freeing up agents to deal with more complex and emotive inquiries its estimated that a successful self service transaction amounts to only 15 percent us4 of the cost of a human agent call us34
2854582 contact centres are under pressure to deal with far higher volumes of calls and to execute queries faster and more effectively and increasing numbers of customers are demanding information immediately and it must be correct gone are the days when customers accepted slow responses from the contact centre the contact centre industry is fast approaching the threshold when it will no longer be able to manage the volumes of demand from customers
2854583 customer expectations increased complexity of inquiries and highly dynamic environments are just some of the considerations that impact a successful self service offering and the cost of getting it wrong is significantly higher than the cost benefit of getting it right

2854592 well you have her in excellent shape she looks like new do you sail her very often
2854593 no she is too tough for me to sail alone not having an engine makes it really hard for me to get her in and out of the slip

2854611 yes i sure do that will really show them something
2854612 ok first we are going to practice backing up a little bit now i am going to head over by that channel marker we will pretend it is the first piling of your slip as we approach we are going to slow by letting the sails luff we just want to keep steerage way on the boat now as we get to the piling we turn sharply into the wind now you back the jib to the port side ill back the main to starboard thats good hold it hold it we are backing now hold it slack off a bit good hold that wonderful we are ready

2854677 we are both adult enough to not be embarrassed by that arent we
2854678 why thank you john but you are the only man i want to react that way come and kiss me
2854679 from what we understand there is a gang of hoons aged in their twenties from the kallangur area that are behind this
2854680 these are really vicious cases that are deliberately calculated and cruel
2854681 when you look at the case of the crow someone has actually held this bird down and sawed off its wings its just sick and disturbing
2854682 when you look at animal cruelty its one of the key profiling tools used by police to indicate the potential for further criminal activity
2854683 i have had girlfriends in the past but not like this and she is the one
2854684 you know when you have met the one well i have simple as that
2854685 that was the first time chinese people as a whole stood up to the world
2854686 its good for chinese people that incident proves that when chinese are upset they can find their voice
2854687 as soon as they get online they can be totally immersed in a chinese environment
2854688 when we were studying abroad occasionally you went to chinatown to read a chinese paper now if youre in the u k you can easily not read english papers or watch english tv
2854689 at this time were focusing on the health and welfare of the guests involved in this tragic accident
2854690 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2854691 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2854692 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2854693 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2854694 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2854695 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2854696 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2854697 entregar o governo para que la paz n o seja derrotada

2854709 re education through labour is completely illegal under international law this is arbitrary detention
2854710 we deal with scalpers according to how serious the case is including the number of tickets they resell the profits they make and whether they repeatedly break the law so its hard to say whether we re educate scalpers through labour if they resell tickets

2854714 theres no slam dunk 100 percent way to prevent identity theft
2854715 a lot of people take a laissez faire attitude toward protecting their credit and protecting their identity
2854716 but there are a lot of things you can do
2854717 getting rid of the paper means youre taking away one of the things identity thieves love
2854718 with those bills and the tuition coming due and hanging over your head it does put you in a bit of a panic
2854719 only to find out the lenders theyve chosen are no longer going to be offering loans this fall
2854720 some of these rates have no caps which means if interest rates rise you could be up to paying 15 to 18 percent on these loans
2854721 you know when he comes out so its very scary
2854722 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2854723 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2854724 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2854725 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2854726 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2854727 we hope that there is no further bloodshed there has been too much bloodshed already
2854728 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2854729 it has to be condemned and the world needs to stand against it

2854743 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that

2854850 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
2854851 we are a family and well get through this together as a family
2854852 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot

2854855 the best vacation i ever had was a boat trip on the congo river
2854856 an american once told me that was three years ago in mozambique in a five star beach resort i was on the un payroll i had escaped the peacekeeping mission on rnr while he was on a reconnaissance trip for his multi millionaire clients
2854857 our six planned boat trips on the congo river are fully booked for 2007
2854858 says the belgium of his wealthy eco tourists congos paths have definitely become unbeaten
2854859 no congolese has no responsibility into whats going on in congo
2854860 because we the congolese we want peace we are tired of this foreign sponsored war and instability
2854861 why do i feel like im the only one talking
2854862 ill gun your sorry ass down if you touch fifi my pet gorilla
2854863 youre free but your shadow is chaos and it will always be there by your side

2854870 in the course of our research we were surprised by the amount of medical inaccuracies that these newspapers had published said dr racine some journalists even wrote about mrs schiavos reactions to specific words or expressions supposedly showing that she was conscious
2854871 our observations show that the press capitalized on the controversy to a large extent and selling copies mattered more than delivering scientific information media coverage sustained myths and false hopes
2854872 the public debate surrounding this case showed that the medical ethical and legal consensuses on the legitimacy of the withdrawal of treatment in accordance to a patients will were challenged
2854873 this case is quite original because it reveals the emergence of a pro life social stream a trend that has now reached canada
2854874 it could incide acts of violence by a small radical segment
2854875 married at nine to the much older muhammad aisha uses her wits her courage and her sword to defend her first wife status even as muhammad marries again and again taking 12 wives and concubines in all
2854876 the pain of consummation soon melted away muhammad was so gentle i hardly felt the scorpions sting to be in his arms skin to skin was the bliss i had longed for all my life
2854877 it was my hope that my book would develop empathy for this other culture

2854880 sometimes an email is just an email and this one should not be read as some sort of clue on timing of an announcement

2854882 the anger and toxic obsessions overwhelmed even the most reserved beltway wise men
2854883 h er advisers couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution s he never behaved like a chief executive and her own staff proved to be her achilles heel
2854884 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from any specific decision she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
2854885 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2854886 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2854887 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2854888 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2854889 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2854890 we hope that there is no further bloodshed there has been too much bloodshed already
2854891 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2854892 it has to be condemned and the world needs to stand against it
2854893 where we have a government that thinks it has the apparent authority to confiscate children at will as we can see from the recent issues in texas earlier this year something needs to be done
2854894 we are dealing with a fundamental liberty and civil rights issue that has to be recognized and respected by our government the protected right of parenthood
2854895 somewhere along the lines the government stopped believing that the constitution was a restriction on them and not a restriction on the people

2854917 wed have to be comfortable with those other guys to keep randall at quarterback because hes an unbelievable receiver also he could line up for us and be a starter from day one at receiver if he was getting the reps
2854918 baby dre but roark figures to spend most of his time as a wildcat trying to catch touchdown passes instead of throwing them
2854919 for a big tall guy he comes out of breaks very well
2854920 and he runs pretty darned good routes already as a freshman its good to have a big target who runs out of breaks hes still learning the receiver position but the first few days hes done really well
2854921 he locks right up on people when he blocks them and takes them straight to the ground i like that looking at his body youd think youd have to teach that but hes tough hes seen people block and knows how to get his hands on people
2854922 i dont think our dbs have seen this many young guys with that kind of speed i think it caught them off guard at first
2854923 you worry about that but hes been doing just about everything else well
2854924 i had been strong with uk since the summer of my junior year plus i had known coach phillips a long time from him coaching my brother
2854925 i never gave south carolina too much thought when they called
2854926 i wanted the ball to learn how to be a receiver and kentucky was willing to give me that opportunity
2854927 it hasnt been an easy transition but im starting to get the hang of it
2854928 i hate getting hurt but hopefully its not too bad and ill still have a chance to get on the field
2854929 mosley has got to keep coming because if he doesnt those young guys are going to fly past him
2854930 these guys are so fast if it happens its going to happen in a hurry
2854931 i learned my plays in four days thanks to those guys
2854932 they have really taken these young guys under their wings and showed them what they needed to know and how they needed to work
2854933 we talk about that all the time how a lot of us could be out there
2854934 thats why weve been up studying our playbooks all night
2854935 first day smith looked like he knew what he was doing i think that will be a much better spot for him moving forward on the offensive side of the ball
2854936 marcus davis is doing some good things at center it looks like he is going to be in the mix
2854937 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree

2854939 coach t joe tereshinski told me to go to the dining hall every morning and get a big plate full of eggs so thats what ive been doing
2854940 if i get off the ball theres pretty much nothing a tackle or a tight end can do to stop me
2854941 whatever the coaches decide is what ill do im just doing the best i can
2854942 what we lack in quantity we make up for in quality
2854943 just good fundamental football players quick theyre reading their keys properly theyre fitting up in there in their gaps just like theyre supposed to were just real pleased with them

2854946 thats pretty much my story when my fiance got home last friday he found me waiting for him in a black mask leather bodice black hose and stiletto pumps he was so turned on that we not only made love all night he wants to move up our wedding date
2854947 but right now no 14 is no 1 at quarterback
2854948 first thing that got my attention was his competitive instincts
2854949 im sure i would have wound up at byu if they hadnt let coach crowton go
2854950 i grew up a byu guy then look what happened coach crowton winds up at lsu and he comes calling again

2854957 thats sort of like me and i needed somebody else who was like that to teach me about the game
2854958 me being young and not knowing the offense really well and not getting to play with him until we were thrown out onto the field definitely had something to do with it
2854959 that was probably the lowest of the lows for me
2854960 those are the guys you see every day those are the guys you work with those are the guys who build your confidence up
2854961 just to know that they continue to trust you to know they still feel the same way about you it just makes you get out of your slump
2854962 he knows that youre not always going to get what you want in life the way you want it
2854963 you start talking to more people you start noticing more people respect you you start noticing you influence more people
2854964 so it kind of not forces you but you just want to go out and make sure you can help everybody
2854965 i love these guys i dont have any brothers but all these guys are my brothers

2854971 i think everybody recognises what the consequences of any kind of conflict in iran would be
2854972 five or six pots boiling over in the middle east our nation cant afford to be mesmerised by one problem of iran
2854973 this constant drumbeat of conflict is not helpful and not useful
2854974 i expect that there will be no war and that is what we ought to be working for
2854975 when one starts such actions in the middle east one cannot manage reactions that can spread over years or even decades

2854979 only to find out the lenders theyve chosen are no longer going to be offering loans this fall
2854980 some of these rates have no caps which means if interest rates rise you could be up to paying 15 to 18 percent on these loans

2855004 without diminishing the callous and brutal nature of this crime which was certainly committed partly for financial gain and with no regard to the sanctity of human life i believe that a determinate sentence is appropriate
2855005 my client states his instructions are that ben clark acted alone and that is what we maintained throughout the trial and unfortunately the jury did not accept that
2855006 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2855007 our argument is that the fixed costs people face in terms of rent and utilities makes that quite inequitable
2855008 prices are rising inflation is an issue mr rudd had the opportunity to address pensions in the budget and he chose not to do so
2855009 mr rudd has the money he has the massive surplus delivered to him by many years of sound economic management by john howard and peter costello and he chose to forget the pensioners
2855010 weve been standing up and fighting for pensioners and retirees in opposition as we did in government
2855011 the benefits and the bonuses to superannuation all the measures taken under the howard years were designed to deliver better benefits for pensioners and older australians
2855012 mr rudd is the one who forgot pensioners in the budget and he is the one that should be answerable for it
2855013 the government has its centrepiece building wa a package of infrastructure projects with such long lead times that many wont come to fruition until its time to vote again in another four years when victoria park mla ben wyatt is premier
2855014 it really requires the premier to come out immediately and clarify the situation
2855015 is ben wyatt the next in line during the next term is mr carpenter going to serve out the full term
2855016 mr halden does not say things like this unless theres truth to them
2855017 there are always sticking points in any dialogue but we are confident we will overcome
2855018 based on the statements by family members that mr hayes had been treated of late for a number of medical issues we believe that led to his death today there are no plans for an autopsy

2855024 i gave it my all unfortunately sometimes things dont want to go the right way
2855025 the evidence to date is that a significant moderation in demand is now occurring and it is looking more likely the demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead
2855026 while inflation is likely to remain high in the short term the board judged at its august meeting that demand was slowing to an extent that could be expected to bring about a significant reduction in inflation over time
2855027 on this basis the board decided that the existing monetary policy setting was appropriate for the time being
2855028 on the assumption that the subdued demand conditions are like to continue scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing
2855029 the combination of falls in housing and equity prices means that household net wealth has declined in the first half of this year

2855044 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2855045 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2855046 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2855047 to be a force to be reckoned with means a lot this year has just been phenomenal its just crazy
2855048 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump
2855049 i never could get the runs in the right spots
2855050 i needed to stay with him to be close enough to try to make a move in a braking zone we never could get close enough to get an opportunity
2855051 i hope i can give the wood brothers a shot in the arm that they need to really get the momentum to move forward
2855052 i knew that he was going to be good we both came in together and left together and that was probably the win right there to be able to beat him off pit road once we did that i kind of got up through the esses better than him and we pulled away
2855053 it was a big hit for a bunch of guys
2855054 we were ready to attack i know with nine to go you get up on the wheel and push hard pushing and shoving is ok but that was crazy i guess there wasnt much place to go they kept pushing and shoving
2855055 i knew getting a good start was going to be good and once i got that then it changed all my worries
2855056 we want them to feel that theyre being judged on their smarts and their competitiveness and their compassion and not just you know looking cute
2855057 well she seems like a good person her family seems to love her everybody makes mistakes so i hope that people wont judge her for just this one picture
2855058 we want to make sure that theyre not landing on some site that would make us blanch
2855059 when i let her know that i understood and heard what she was saying i think that was important to her
2855060 as a consequence of my books doing well suddenly its easier to get takeout whenever we feel like it its easier to get a housekeeper to come in one or two days to help do the laundry or help clean up its easier to do a lot of things that frankly the vast majority of american women cant afford but were not that far removed from the situation where this work was falling on her in a very heavy way
2855061 but what i know is that shell be at the center of the democratic party for a very long time
2855062 bob her thesis from 20 years ago is public just go the politico website and type in the search section when will john mccain talk about his adultery from 25 years ago or cindy mccain talk about her drug problems
2855063 by taking the nomination in a slimey way from a very competent female someone more prepared to assume the mantle of president of united states than him but gender won out here and played out here all across the united states
2855064 but compared with his attending the olympic games the profit is much larger than the loss
2855065 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2855066 china will be a better place if there is more freedom of religion
2855067 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2855068 president hu seemed to indicate that the door is opening on religious freedom in china and that in the future there will be more room for religious believers
2855069 it is good that the president can worship here but it is not likely that we will have more freedom or be able to register our churches
2855070 several house churches have been closed before the olympics the police say that we are threatening national security and demand that my husband gives up his faith
2855071 he needs to justify and defend his successful policy towards east asia
2855072 he has been more successful in the region than china
2855073 he did not waver in his decision to come and he emphasized that not going would have been an affront to the chinese people that has been very well received in china
2855074 it is an irony that like other presidents hes finding china a pretty nice place there are no hecklers and he can make his points and the u s can feel superior its a welcome diversion from washington
2855075 of course the president bears the ultimate responsibility but he was very badly served by both the vice president and most of all the secretary of defense
2855076 look weve got to get everybody on board in order to get progress made in this country im not going to you know take retaliation or retribution against anybody whether theyre democrats or republicans
2855077 im sure all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2855078 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2855079 we werent even advised that they were going to be there
2855080 they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen
2855081 i opened this store about a year ago business has been ok now i dont know how im going to afford to fix it up
2855082 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
2855083 the main source of support for the u s economy in recent quarters has been the strength of net exports
2855084 but the world economy has fallen off the edge of a cliff
2855085 and this is very illegal so the following material is for educational use only
2855086 it is extremely important to maintain the security and integrity of the fare media systems
2855087 with an insecure compromised system even basic revenue controls to name one example become significantly challenging
2855088 if you prevent legitimate researchers from talking about their findings its not going to stop people from finding vulnerabilities its going to stop the good guys from talking about them and from learning from each other
2855089 the bad guys are still going to be looking for the vulnerabilities and still be finding them
2855090 it was a magical and memorable spectacle and a great way to start the beijing olympics
2855091 hi my name is cream puff at least thats what they call me anyways this is the story of how i ran away lost my virginity lost my virginity again ran away again got kidnapped by bikers and turned into a rowdy biker bitch
2855092 our study showed that functions can be maintained in older animals so long as damaged proteins continue to be efficiently removed strongly supporting the idea that protein buildup in cells plays an important role in aging itself
2855093 even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
2855094 most people with these conditions are born with a mutation that gives rise to defective proteins but they dont experience symptoms until later in life
2855095 we think thats because their protein clearance systems can handle abnormal proteins when the person is younger but get overwhelmed as their efficiency falls with age by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time
2855096 theres reason to hope that drugs exerting a similar effect throughout the body may help us enjoy healthier lives well into old age
2855097 one thing new this year with the carnival on thursday we had a 1 ride day all rides were available for 1 meaning you could ride each ride for 1 and that did seem to draw a few hundred more children into the program
2855098 once you ride a wave youll understand completely why people who do it keep doing it
2855099 its really a unique feeling that you cant get any other way
2855100 the nhs should be available to all who need it
2855101 yet 1 300 cancer patients were denied the treatment that could have made all the difference to them this audit shows that the exceptional cases process is in chaos and patients are suffering in the last 20 months 5 000 cancer patients have been forced to plead for their lives there has to be a better way we urge the government to end this bizarre and demeaning lottery
2855102 we have heard from patients that one of their major concerns is the perceived
2855103 the draft nhs constitution will address this by making it explicit that patients have the right to nice approved drugs if clinically appropriate we will also speed up the national process for appraising new drugs and make more transparent and consistent the process for local funding of drugs not appraised by nice or where nice has yet to issue guidance

2855114 from 2007 to the first half of 2008 vulnerabilities affecting web server applications accounted for 51 percent of all vulnerability disclosures
2855115 without a unified process for disclosing vulnerabilities the research industry runs the risk of actually fueling online criminal activity
2855116 there is a reason why x force does not publish exploit code for the vulnerabilities we have found and perhaps it is time for others in our field to reconsider this practice
2855117 well no but since we cant move in until the end of the month we arent exactly spoiled for choice

2855128 there are some select applications that require 8gb sec fc right now like high definition video
2855129 the key driver for 8gb sec is virtualisation and server consolidation
2855130 95 of respondents to our latest survey state that virtualisation is critical to achieving their business objectives
2855131 in that case youll need more ports and more bandwidth
2855132 even with virtualisation youre not automatically going to saturate your pipes
2855133 we tested four applications on one processor and we hit an hba host bus adapter bottleneck at 50 000 iops

2855135 were waiting for boards so we can do more testing and benchmarking
2855136 the 8gb sec components require new optics the price wont drop to 4gb sec levels until the volumes ramp up
2855137 there will be a 20 to 30 price premium over 4gb sec components initially
2855138 these involve how data corruption is handled and how you authenticate the host to the fc fabric
2855139 you may be able to turn off lanes on the pci bus and power off lanes in the hba and ports

2855158 we agree with corporate america that patent troll behavior has to stop
2855159 but whats happening is the subtlety of that problem is not being analyzed and the entrepreneurs the innovators are getting sucked into this problem
2855160 regardless of what congress does regardless of what corporations do companies like us are just going to have to work harder to make sure that what they submit to the patent office really has all the is dotted and the ts crossed
2855161 weve spent enormous amounts of time and money getting people to listen
2855162 these cases have created a disincentive to talk to patent owners and take a license
2855163 why buy the cow if you can get milk through the fence
2855164 congresss goal in crafting any patent legislation should be the protection of the entrepreneur who is in his or her garage right now designing the next life changing innovation
2855165 has not kept pace with our fast growing technology driven economy and without comprehensive patent reform inventors and entrepreneurs will be less inclined to produce new products and services that benefit all americans and help grow our economy
2855166 he believes that invention and innovation whether from small businesses or corporations should receive uniform treatment

2855177 we became aware of the directive last month but we needed this confirmation today
2855178 this year we are exploring the needs of not only the defense establishment but of those facing civil aviation authorities and commercial service providers as well
2855179 when you talk about focusing on the big picture this is it
2855180 weve worked hard to create a forum that takes a more detailed look at the real issues facing those charged with trying to evolve defense and civil agencies into net centric frameworks
2855181 we are very excited that we can offer this enhanced benefit for our expectant tdp enrollees

2855187 if you need to submit a package you do it all on line
2855188 the air force will take additional steps if necessary to fill these shortage career fields but would prefer to fill them with volunteers

2855190 sometimes it takes a special effort to get out there and see what your warfighter is confronted with
2855191 we have some of the sharpest people in the air force
2855192 they must be technically solid and be able to interpret data from leading edge satellite systems
2855193 i know everything i do helps the success of aircraft and troops on the ground in iraq and afghanistan
2855194 most of the time people dont know pmel exists until something needs to be fixed
2855195 our job is important because everything we calibrate gets traced back to the national institute of standards and technology standards so we know the item is accurate
2855196 if its traceable and has to have an accurate measurement done to it were the ones who perform it
2855197 its kind of unique considering we support over 14 000 items
2855198 a normal pmel would have about 35 personnel for that amount of inventory were able to keep it down to 17 because we are a 24 hour operation here
2855199 we are way under sized with one of the largest inventories in the air force
2855200 probably the heaviest workload here involves torque wrenches and pressure gauges which cover about 35 percent of the total items we see
2855201 the stuff we dont have the equipment for were able to do through lateral support with other bases in the region
2855202 the new building will eliminate half the amount of items we need to send out for lateral support
2855203 the climate here affects the temperature and humidity requirements for the laboratory
2855204 we have a bunch of dehumidifiers throughout the lab they are constantly on to combat the humidity
2855205 humidity is very bad for a lot of things we do
2855206 we have to keep the level of humidity high enough to prevent static electricity discharge and low enough to prevent corrosion
2855207 when some u s troops were overrun in afghanistan recently and the 379 aew was able to accurately provide them with air cover by dropping bombs only on the taliban
2855208 we know those bombs fell the way they were supposed to fall because of the measurements we did on the aircrafts missile guided test sets
2855209 if we dont do our job they cant do their job its just that simple
2855210 these e mails are prime examples of the use of social engineering to infect your computer
2855211 the cnn brand is well respected and top stories and alerts are commonly used for valid communications the stories featured in the malicious e mail are either actual stories currently in the news or stories that are plausible this piques peoples interest eager to see more information they click on a link that takes them not to cnn but to some site designed to infect them with malware
2855212 the classic example of a fingerprint is an ink imprint showing the unique swirls and loops used for identification but fingerprints also leave behind a unique distribution of molecular compounds
2855213 some of the residues left behind are from naturally occurring compounds in the skin and some are from other surfaces or materials a person has touched
2855214 because the distribution of compounds found in each fingerprint can be unique we also can use this technology to pull one fingerprint out from beneath layers of other fingerprints
2855215 by looking for compounds we know to be present in a certain fingerprint we can separate it from the others and obtain a crystal clear image of that fingerprint the image could then be used with fingerprint recognition software to identify an individual

2855218 we hope to learn more about purdues innovative approach to research and the role discovery park and the purdue research park play in growing a cluster of high tech and life sciences businesses
2855219 we are coming to purdue to see listen and learn
2855220 yonsei is proud of its history and reputation as a leading institution of higher education and research in asia
2855221 this is a great opportunity to showcase how discovery park has led purdues efforts in generating more record levels of sponsored research and assisted in the startup of 24 companies many now at purdue research park
2855222 the goal of the cluster is to increase the korean medical industrys international competitiveness as well as revitalize the regional economy
2855223 purdue university through what it has accomplished from discovery park in recent years and its longstanding success at the purdue research park provides a complementary model for the innovative biomedical device industry cluster in wonju south korea
2855224 the purpose of lg global challenger is to give students the opportunity to visit places of innovation from the around world and to broaden our worldview

2855226 le sali todo mal porque ahora los animales no tienen agua en las lagunas y salen a buscarla a las orillas donde quedan empantanados o se caen en las partes barrancosas y se los lleva el agua

2855250 i know i can get to the point where i can ride some really bigger fast waves
2855251 we just have to go out there and get it to where she can put me in the exact spot where i need to be which usually entails a lot of getting worked over for me and a lot of smiles and laughs for celine
2855252 sometimes they were so full of people that they put people in the trunks of cars
2855253 i wondered what was going on so i called the state authorities

2855255 alyana a study of autism in the philippines has been shown all over the philippines and her second film
2855256 alyana for example led to its repeat showing barely after two months coupled with the holding celebration of the first world autism awareness day and autism forum in the city
2855257 when boyer responded that he could not a jail guard physically and violently removed him from his wheelchair using excessive force
2855258 the jail guard yanked boyer out of his wheelchair spun him around turned him and violently let him go
2855259 the audience has just watched a play on thalassemia and theyre grinning
2855260 why cant a thalassemic child be happy why cant a multiple sclerosis patient still be his wifes greatest love and why cant ageing be cheerful these are the questions i ask myself when i work on a play these issues may be serious but they arent about never ending gloom
2855261 there are lots of songs and dances and of course images of the great indian family nosy neighbours and forbidden love
2855262 it lay in positive thinking and my theatre became a medium to spread that message
2855263 i also made the thalassemic child a brat because he is pampered by everybody in the family he is cheerful a good dancer and grows up to be an engineer
2855264 under such circumstances doctors generally advise aborting the foetus india has more than one lakh thalassemics most of them in border states like punjab bengal and gujarat
2855265 the challenge lies is portraying the parts so that the humour does not suppress the serious message and vice versa
2855266 i had a great time in england and people were so nice to me all week
2855267 we had great waves at the start and tough ones today but it was always lots of fun so stoked to get this first title such a big thing it is a great confidence boost for the upcoming events
2855268 pablo paulino surfed so well and i want to congratulate him
2855269 it was one of my dreams to win the event here as i really love the waves and the atmosphere here i am very happy and i hope things can keep going as good for me
2855270 things are going well for me so i am still very happy with that second place
2855271 i am slowly get closer to my only goal and dream which is to qualify for the asp world tour
2855272 i was very tired in that heat and the conditions were tough all day
2855273 i felt like my legs were not responding anymore and i was not able to complete my turns well enough its been a great event though and i am alread looking forward to competing in france
2855274 i have had a great year so far and it is so enjoyable
2855275 it has been lots of heats still and it very hard to remain at your best with all the travel inbetween events but i hope i can be 100 fit for lacanau coming up so stoked with this year
2855276 i was just in the wrong spot all heat and could not get any good wave out there
2855277 i got far today but just one short to the final i am still happy with it and congratulations to wiggoly dantas he surfed a smart heat
2855278 it is a good result for me one of my best four this year so it is definitely good enough
2855279 i just hope to get things together and keep going as good in the next events
2855280 i did not really know wha was going on out there because the on shore wind was just too strong
2855281 i saw get on that bomb and i knew he could get a huge score he is such a good surfer and winner here he got a 9 77 but i was still ahead and then i got that 8 57 and was still not enough after his last wave put him ahead it is disappointing
2855282 i am not really looking at the ratings and there is nothing really big until i reach my goal which is to qualify for the asp world tour
2855283 i have been working hard to get to it and i am looking forward to surfing good and having fun during my heats
2855284 we decided to take it upon ourselves to create a space where the newest generation of voters

2855289 whats it like to wake up in the morning and realize that youre isaac hayes
2855290 im just now really getting it the worlds gone retro its like a rebirth people everywhere i go say wow isaac hayes wow but i just got married to my fourth wife about six months ago and she didnt know who i was when i first met her shes from africa and its a revelation to her and a revelation to me too the way they still remember im revered now is it my age all the things ive done i never think about all the things ive done until moments like this talking to you im moving so much ive learned just to keep working learned it from my grandmother when i used to pick cotton in the fields as a little kid i was always looking back to see if i got cotton in my sack and she said stop dont look back just keep picking youll find out so i was picking picking picking and then it felt like someone was standing on my sack i looked back my sack is full i always keep my head down working doing things moving forward thats what ive done all my life then you stop and realize what youve done damn i did that i dont sit back and count up what ive done theres just always something else to do theres always a challenge ahead ive faced those challenges and hit em you know
2855291 this was a great place when it was flourishing where we would see many antique shoppers wander in this area had a slightly run down but funky and attractive feel
2855292 it took us over a year to find the right spot we wanted to stay downtown but it was hard to find the right price because the pace family the previous owners of the building were always generous about the lease rate
2855293 we were able to mitigate the cost by having some lydia place offices in the new space
2855294 i was recruited into doing this right after i retired and ive enjoyed meeting so many great people
2855295 at the new space were hoping to see more college students who might need inexpensive household products
2855296 wanita memiliki kapasitas respon seksual yang tak terbatas yang lebih hebat dari yang pernah dibayangkan laki laki manapun
2855297 sangat banyak laki laki dewasa yang dapat mencapai lebih dari 4 atau 5 kali klimaks dalam jangka waktu tertentu
2855298 namun seorang anak laki laki remaja kadang kadang mencapai 6 kali orgasme atau lebih dan seperempat anak anak pra remaja yang kami catat pernah mengalami orgasme hingga 5 kali dan dalam beberapa kasus sebanyak 10 hingga 20 kali atau lebih dalam waktu beberapa jam
2855299 over 50 to 100 persons approach the office every day as there is no easy entrance to the office they often face problems the situation has worsened as the work for the subway is expected to take more time
2855300 we have been trying to help the visitors to come to the office but its been very difficult those who come in wheelchairs are asked to wait outside and we ask our staff to go out to meet them we are also trying to minimise the time in processing their forms and applications
2855301 the administration has taken a decision to shift the office from the existing premises to the new administrative building we expect to do so in the next six months as the construction work of the building is in its final stage the approach road was widened and repaired recently which will make the access easy
2855302 if the current talks fail to reach any settlement mugabe should be banned from attending any summits or meetings as president of zimbabwe

2855305 why hasnt facebook bought twitter and integrated it into their system
2855306 even with better technology there were concerns the work force might slow it down but we havent experienced that at all
2855307 they disabled workers are learning how to be accurate and how to be fast

2855309 the community mix of locals its not trendy they have great business owners and professionals love lamb and jaffey the fruit stands are great the quality and prices of the produce the neighborhood has a euro style where you have the meat market fruit stands bakeries etc
2855310 this happened last week but on the bus we kissed nothing dirty just a clean kiss then an old lady on the bus bugged out and slammed her umbrella on the floor and yelled public bus
2855311 what i remember most is looking at a burning wreckage of two aircraft a helicopter and a fixed wing aircraft and realizing that 45 men were trapped inside that burning wreckage sitting on fuel bladders and knowing they had no chance of survival
2855312 and then doing the only thing that i could do and that was to call on the name of the jesus christ and ask him to spare those men and he did
2855313 no matter where i am kurt calls me on the 20th of december and just says thanks its the anniversary of my rescue what a wonderful guy he is
2855314 a cascade of blood as wide as the truck spilled out like a waterfall i heard my mens blood splashing down on the ground my stomach rolled and tears closed my throat the medics began separating the living from the dead
2855315 i found myself saying there is no god or this never wouldve happened
2855316 had a crisis in faith and as a result of seeing that and feeling the pain of it i literally said there is no god
2855317 i cant say that ive totally healed from that experience
2855318 i will carry that forever having said that ive moved on i moved beyond it
2855319 this is my own personal belief but one of the most fundamental reasons that they hate us is a we are a nation of believers and b because we support israel
2855320 no i dont regret it all no let me look you in the eye and tell you when all of that broke and the media went after me with such a vengeance it became overpowering
2855321 and i will just tell you going back to the title of the book there were days that i just said im ready to quit
2855322 i am not anti any religion because i spent too much of my life supporting and defending the right to worship
2855323 but i think as christians we need to recognize that evil manifests itself in many ways and many forms and this radical islam is one of those pure manifestations of pure evil
2855324 a non muslim may not become a citizen of the maldives
2855325 this denial of citizenship to non muslims is an extraordinarily harsh measure which places the maldives among the worst countries in the world in regards to the legal foundation for freedom of religion and belief
2855326 we obviously have sticking points like in any talks but we look forward to overcome them
2855327 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america

2855337 barbarous and civilized peoples have held a higher standard of morals for women than men
2855338 that women have been and are better by practice than men i cheerfully admit that they are inherently better i positively deny
2855339 a perverted public sentiment tolerates and fosters the inconsistencies of profanity tobacco alcohol and vice in men and condemns these habits as unpardonable sins when indulged in by women
2855340 if the double standard of morals is responsible for nine tenths of the inconsistencies practiced by men and these habits are responsible for nine tenths of race degeneracy then the teaching of a consistent standard of morals is the only practical and rational solution of these problems
2855341 a verbal contract is only as good as the paper its written on

2855346 care homes can be such miserable places you sit there all day staring out the window with no one to talk to
2855347 i thought it would be lovely to give a home and family life to one or two people who would otherwise be sitting around there
2855348 i started asking people if they wanted to move out of their care homes and live with me and ive had dozens of offers they are queuing up
2855349 its nice for me too because at my age its handy to have someone to live with now every book that sells will help towards making a home for someone

2855358 ive never done an ebay auction before so i didnt know what to expect but i am upset and frustrated after someone from bristol bid 10m and ive since found out she hasnt got that sort of money
2855359 ive spoken to ebay and the bid stands there are also bids for 9m on there from other people but if the 10m bid is won then that person wont be able to pay for the estate and the auction will have been a waste of time it feels like people have been scuppering my genuine auction

2855361 if americans simply kept their tires inflated to the standard specs the country could conserve as much oil as is expected to be pumped out of the ocean with the additional offshore drilling favored by his rival presumptive republican nominee john mccain
2855362 never offend people with style when you can offend them with substance
2855363 as of us last talking together he is no longer employed
2855364 he insults journalists and journalism at virtually every whistle stop on his tour
2855365 he says its not about democracy its about profits the american public and policy makers have to decide whether journalism is produced purely for the reaping of profit or if its a central component to a functioning participatory democracy
2855366 you make policy accordingly there is no such thing as a deregulated media policy system the only question is will the media be regulated for the largest media corporations or regulated on behalf of the american public thats what all of our anticonsolidation efforts are about
2855367 what the hard core reformistas really want it seems is not diversity or an open debate but a media that promotes their own vision of society and the world
2855368 media reform cannot win without widespread support and such support needs to be organized as part of a broad anti corporate pro democracy movement
2855369 to rip the veil off corporate power and to work so that social decision making and power may be made as enlightened and as egalitarian as possible
2855370 the need to promote an understanding of the urgency to assert public control over the media
2855371 our claim is simply that the media system produces vastly less of quality than it would if corporate and commercial pressures were lessened
2855372 i was so amazed i fell to floor i was so excited
2855373 were really proud of what austins accomplished with this we think its really neat that someone from rural midwest can set their goals like this and achieve something you know thats normally not done in a rural setting and we think hell be very successful in this endeavor
2855374 when i read the outline for that i was amazed i was like man we could actually put this together we could do something great here
2855375 it was a challenge we knew it was going to be challenge coming in but the first few days we casted our actors and we started breaking down the script and getting our locations and it all just started coming together started beginning to flow and it came together really smooth and im absolutely astonished with the final product when i look back im amazed at how we put everything together something this awesome in just one week
2855376 id definitely like to get into this someday and maybe someday move out to hollywood they say if you wanna be country music singer you move to nashville if you want to be a film director you have to move to hollywood
2855377 were not through yet but weve taken a break mr mugabe said as he left the talks overnight at a harare hotel being mediated by south african president thabo mbeki
2855378 there are always sticking points in any dialogue but we are confident we will overcome
2855379 i dont think its worth me getting what i would call premature stress over something that may not occur
2855380 but that doesnt mean im not going to give it serious thought in the meantime
2855381 this is a big wake up call for mr rudd
2855382 this is an extraordinary swing and it underlines the disillusionment australians are seeing and feeling with the lack of leadership from the new federal labor government a government that promised so much
2855383 last year kevin 07 was everywhere dripping with empathy draping himself across petrol station forecourts shopping centre aisles promising to stop prices going up
2855384 and all weve got is one watch after another fuelwatch grocerywatch and who knows what the next watch exercise will be
2855385 i dont think that we can construe from the northern territory some grand lessons for western australia
2855386 obviously were going to wait and see the results to be finalised during the course of this week
2855387 obviously generally the public says to politicians they want them to serve their term and get the job done but circumstances can bring early elections on and thats whats happened in western australia
2855388 i could force you to download child porn or send subversive material to china
2855389 the exploitation is almost limitless google has to fix it
2855390 it turns out a lot of people who develop these things arent good at security
2855391 weve been telling google about these vulnerabilities for years and they have not made corrective actions
2855392 they chose to open the doors and insomuch put a lot of consumers at risk
2855393 the terwilliger curves of the portland area on a typical business day
2855394 the markets are clearly causing all companies to reconsider their plans
2855395 i am delighted that sir william has accepted the role his skills and knowledge are invaluable in these treacherous times
2855396 executives wanted an older hunk to bring in the baby boomer audience tom is incredibly popular with women 40 through 65 and producers were ecstatic when at steves urging he expressed interest in competing on the show
2855397 every time it goes down we try to just pass it on as promptly as possible because the public needs to drive to keep this economy going
2855398 the next logical step in the operational separation process that telecom began earlier this year
2855399 telecom needs to take immediate and serious action to improve its situation and to consider and debate new ideas that will benefit customers and shareholders
2855400 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
2855401 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish

2855403 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
2855404 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
2855405 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
2855406 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
2855407 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
2855408 at this time were focusing on the health and welfare of the guests involved in this tragic accident
2855409 the culture the custom of the cajun people its gone
2855410 its another one of the rights that big government has taken away from the people
2855411 theyre still going to fight theyre still going to fight for years to come
2855412 theyve still got cockfighting in every state they just hide it from the law
2855413 cockfighting may still be going on with much smaller venues in the back woods but my understanding is there hasnt been any big activity since the gambling ban
2855414 a lot of people are going to quit theyre just going to shut down
2855415 were losing out on an opportunity to keep our heritage and our culture
2855416 i can go up there on any given weekend and go to a rooster fight and its wide open like its not against the law

2855520 burned a huge area of the neighbourhood with intense heat
2855521 given the impact of the blast the citys residents got off very lucky there was a very very large amount of fire when we arrived and the extent of the explosion if the blast was heard as far away as it was could have been much more serious hopefully we wont find that there are a lot of people missing or injured but so far it looks like we got off very lucky
2855522 residents in the area were shaken out of sleep by a thunderous explosion and vibrant orange balls of fire lighting up the sky
2855523 air quality tests later in the day showed the explosion was not toxic but police continued to ask people to leave the hot spot and take shelter in nearby york university some people raced out of their homes still wearing their pyjamas grabbing only their loved ones and pets others piled into cars to drive out of the area to the safety of the homes of friends

2855530 can you imagine that if toronto had been hosting the olympics this week people would have thought it was a terrorist act
2855531 toronto only narrowly edged out madrid spain philadelphia and mexico city mexico to hang on at no 10
2855532 toronto is still the economic heart of one of the worlds wealthiest countries and its projected to keep humming through 2020

2855579 the people that have written and donated to me gave me the most motivation

2855653 for many years i have warned against russian actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbors
2855654 unfortunately we have seen in recent days russia demonstrate that these concerns were well founded
2855655 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia

2855664 were selling various food types to people as a major fundraiser for our club
2855665 i think it might be just the thought of food at a fair and makes you think its ok to binge with it plus you can support a local group
2855666 we want to encourage children to be involved in good nutrition and learn how to prepare foods at home that dont have as many preservatives and avoid fast foods
2855667 you can show kids that once you start with the seed and get it to the finished project its an amazing feeling to see what youve done

2855671 the first official message ever in which he speaks english
2855672 calls for the people to support jihad in pakistan and lists a litany of grievances against the pakistani government and us involvement there
2855673 he also relates his own personal experiences having lived in pakistan in an apparent attempt to build a stronger connection with the pakistani people
2855674 wants to speak directly to the pakistani people and chose english because he cannot speak urdu

2855678 the government advisers are saying that her release is at final stages but the party is not being informed about the matter
2855679 tarique rahman is being forced to spend his last days in hospital because of the governments bias
2855680 the country is witnessing a silent famine but the government does not have any programme to get over the situation
2855681 we decided that in the long run while the process might take a little longer it would prevent any complaints from the public about the appointments
2855682 she is absolutely the right woman to lead the organisation
2855683 i would describe her as having compassionate courage she is unreproachable purely motivated and has the love and support of the staff
2855684 i wont say she is faultless and that no other person could do the job but her record of success speaks for itself
2855685 and really how significant is a degree if she can do the job she has qualities that cannot be taught
2855686 she has acquitted herself well and she has a good personality
2855687 and we will have more restructuring and possibly a smaller board
2855688 there will still be a mix there and both officials and nonofficials contribute well but it is good to have business people on it i believe in transparency and we want to give other people an opportunity
2855689 there are good things happening at the hsa and because mr eden has an intimate view of the things that are happening well we now have a stable leadership and are moving forward would it make sense to disrupt this now with a new board
2855690 we have made our operations more business savvy and become more efficient in our investments
2855691 im not even sure that i should sit on it
2855692 its hard to have free and frank discussions with so many ministry officials sitting there
2855693 we have been taking steps to clarify what peoples roles are there will be a redefinition and repositioning
2855694 not so long ago people worldwide werent as aware of how drastically oil prices affect practically everything for island people in particular oil prices and the resulting spike in the cost of goods and services such as food electricity and air travel hits a nerve
2855695 soon ill present amendments to the dangerous substances handling and storage law 2003 to cabinet these amendments will seek to regulate the process by which the two current wholesale distributors of gasoline and diesel products and any other distributor who in future may operate in cayman can increase their wholesale prices
2855696 we dont know factually but there have forever and a day been complaints regarding fuel prices from the distributors being raised and being raised with the same fuel that was in their tank farm because the world oil prices rose
2855697 i am not here saying that that is the case im saying that this legislation allows the chief petroleum inspector to examine the rationale for any request for an increase
2855698 gasoline prices are impacted by a number of factors including changes in the price of crude oil government regulations and taxes supply and demand transportation costs speculation by traders and competitive market conditions so its difficult to point to any one thing thats affecting the market at a given time
2855699 governments shouldnt introduce sudden changes in the regulatory framework aiming to offset potential short term problems like volatile pricing it is evident from comparing regulated oil markets with free markets that consumers are best served by allowing market forces to determine fuel prices
2855700 if international prices continue to increase the regulation will not prevent that corresponding impact being passed to end consumers the cayman islands government is passing the wrong message that they have control of fuel prices
2855701 revoke the payment of book fees with immediate effect representing a saving of up to 500 for many families
2855702 additionally cabinet has also agreed to waive all of the arrears that parents may have owed up to the end of the last school year
2855703 an additional cost to government of some 240 000 in lost revenue we firmly believe that it is the right thing to do given that our ultimate goal is to do everything possible to extend the purchasing power of caymanians
2855704 im happy that the government recognises the plight of many caymanian families that are not finding it possible
2855705 to go along with the principle of public education to provide for free education
2855706 i am from a poor family and went through the public education system and scholarship programme
2855707 where would my life have ended up had it not been for public education
2855708 i come from the public school system and the book fee really isnt a lot what is 50 to 100 when you consider that your child is being taken care of
2855709 if it werent for ptas the school facilities wouldnt function because budgets are not enough
2855710 the shape of the economy and the pressure that more and more families are under
2855711 you are all promises and possibilities and having a baby wont change that
2855712 we felt that this group of girls were well deserving of a ceremony like this
2855713 these young ladies would probably not have garnered all the skills they did in this six week programme otherwise and they really did a good job and will make us proud in the future
2855714 when members of the ypp leave us they never really leave and we are just happy that this young lady learnt what we had taught her and did not repeat the cycle
2855715 i have a strong passion for children and as a role model with the help of ypp i can show these young ladies that pregnancy is not the end of the world but is rather a roadblock to overcome
2855716 this programme has encouraged and shown me that having a child is not the end of the end of my life and how to keep my grades up
2855717 i was scared when i found out i was pregnant and didnt know what to do but ypp was like a saving grace
2855718 this programme has taught me how to be a good mother and i am happy for that

2855722 i saw the advertisement for saturday banking on the website coincidentally i was busy working yesterday friday and unable to come to the bank and withdraw money to pay my mortgage and bills thanks to saturday banking i got to pay everything on time i am very happy about the new service
2855723 with my busy schedule i need banking that suits my needs
2855724 i work monday to friday from 7 00 am to 5 00 pm so i dont have a chance to run to the bank saturday banking gives me more time for other things during the week
2855725 we were delighted to see the overwhelmingly positive response to saturday branch banking at governors square
2855726 we understand our customers have demanding schedules and flexible banking hours are yet another asset in butterfields service offering
2855727 i guess many people out there see what appears to be a sudden change in the programmes the truth is this was all put into motion six years ago with the introduction of the game in the schools and then the communities
2855728 it has taken six years to assemble enough interest and local player base to look at stepping up the development for the past six years the emphasis has been on exposing the game to the masses through the schools and communities and to be honest there has been a very small percentage of players who have been exposed to any sort of form of elite development mainly because we have simply not had the numbers
2855729 the schools communities clubs players and coaches have now reached a point where we can start to move the development along it is not acceptable any more to simply introduce the game to the masses we have a strong core of players in each school and community and these players now need to have a structured development pathway to elite levels of preparation from a much earlier age and in both the schools and the communities not just the national programmes
2855730 we are moving along well we are meeting the goals of our five year plan which of course is my term of reference ahead of schedule and we are now starting to see what we needed to see the young developed players starting to replace the seasoned veterans with a mass of even younger and better developed players behind them it is an exciting time and i personally am looking forward to getting back into some higher level elite coaching with players who have the youth drive time understanding and ability to put those sessions into action
2855731 since 1976 these islands have managed to put together a team for every game except in 1980 when the governor asked the team not to compete in moscow during the height of the cold war
2855732 the cayman islands postal service is proud to celebrate our athletes with these stamps athletes who make it to this level are not ordinary going to the olympics represents a major achievement and we in the cayman islands are proud to acknowledge that
2855733 our athletes deserve the backing of the nation and having a set of stamps is certainly fitting to the occasion
2855734 life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all
2855735 the experience brought smiles to everyone and provided the teens with a rewarding lifetime experience
2855736 the proposal of polish prime minister donald tusk to hold a meeting of the european council at the level of heads of government has been accepted we dont know the date yet
2855737 there is a possibility a formal summit will take place in brussels later in the week
2855738 the eu and nato must take the initiative and stand up against the spread of imperialist and revisionist policy in the east of europe
2855739 one of the reasons i decided to choose the cayman islands cancer society as my platform is because of my background as an aesthetician
2855740 i feel i have a responsibility to educate caymanians about the dangers of sun exposure the risks posed and the damage it causes
2855741 the cancer society is the perfect avenue to further reach out into the community to pass on my knowledge and increase public awareness im 24 years of age im passionate about skin and i have ambitions to return to university to pursue a medical degree in dermatology
2855742 the tech sector and the utility sector have been two of the more defensive sectors over the course of the last year and we do find some attractive names there

2855747 ke depan kita upayakan agar kegiatan pramuka semakin berkembang luas di masyarakat terutama keanggotaan pramuka makin banyak pasalnya selama ini banyak pihak yang masih memandang kegiatan pramuka secara kerdil karena itu jajaran pengurus pramuka di sumba tengah akan menggerakkan kegiatan pramuka di kabupaten sumba tengah agar lebih banyak lagi diminati anak anak di wilayah ini kita juga koordinasi dengan pihak dikbud agar menghidupkan gudep pramuka di semua sekolah
2855748 pasar ini terletak di depan kantor bupati sumba barat kasian kalau bangunan ini dibiarkan tanpa ada perawatan juga tanpa ada pedagang yang menghuni kalau bisa pemerintah pindahkan sebagian pedagang yang ada di pasar inpres waikabubak agar masuk ke pasar ini bangunan ini sebaiknya jangan hanya dijadikan pasar hewan tapi sebaiknya juga dijadikan pasar umum artinya semua pedagang bisa berjualan di sini biar ramai
2855749 sebetulnya pedagang siap memanfaatkan gedung itu namun pengaturannya harus dilakukan pemerintah sehingga tidak terjadi kesalahpahaman di antara pedagang apalagi lokasi pasar inpres waikabubak sudah tak mampu lagi menampung pedagang
2855750 im expecting it to be a little emotional but it will grow back
2855751 its going to be weird to get up in the morning and not have to brush my hair
2855752 this is a really easy fundraiser for us because the participants getting their heads shaved raise the money and we put on the dreams
2855753 whats really cool about the dream factory is that the money stays here in the area and goes to local kids
2855754 with some of the national charities you never get to know the person who gets the dream but you have that chance here
2855755 the special rapporteur continues to be alarmed by deaths in custody in china reports describe harrowing scenes in which detainees many of whom are followers of the falun gong movement die as a result of severe ill treatment neglect or medical attention the cruelty and brutality of these alleged acts of torture defy description
2855756 the special rapporteur continues to be very concerned by the continued violations of freedom of religion or belief suffered by members of the falun gong in her previous reports to the commission on human rights she explicitly mentioned members of the falun gong as targets of various human rights violations because of their beliefs and she strongly condemns the continued lack of freedom of belief of members of falun gong
2855757 many of the torture methods alleged to have been practiced on ethnic minorities political dissidents human rights defenders falun gong practitioners and members of house church groups have been used in china
2855758 detainees stated that falun gong practitioners who had not renounced their beliefs after six months in detention were placed in the intensive training section until they were reformed falun gong practitioners formerly detained at this facility mentioned that they would refer to this section as the intensive torture section
2855759 ms li limao who was a falun gong practitioner died one month after the chinese new year in 2005 following a punishment for disobedience she was hung from a window from her hands tied behind her back and with her toes just touching the floor

2855775 i think the trend in stocks is up i do feel that july 15 represented the bottom for stocks and we are going to move higher
2855776 i really feel that what investors are looking for right here is signs that the economy is starting to pick up right now
2855777 it looks like we are finally getting the break weve been waiting for in terms of slowing down the inflation spiral that has been taking place
2855778 you have a tremendous rise in the dollar and thats putting pressure on crude oil which is helping to buoy u s equity markets
2855779 clearly the economy is still weak some of the stimulus from the tax rebates is
2855780 once you go above 6 percent the concerns about recession will go up
2855781 look at the prices of food around the world its unfair to look at just the price of oil as the leading indicator of where inflation trends may be
2855782 theres strong likelihood that the fed is going to have to start to raise interest rates to control inflation
2855783 for a long term investor id advocate slowly going back into commodities right now gold will be my favorite recommendation

2855798 in the first half of 2008 we remained profitable in all our customer groups we also remained profitable in all of our geographical regions with the continuing exception of north america
2855799 revenue rose by 3 percent compared with the first half of 2007 loan impairments were up by 58 percent but were 8 percent lower than in the second half costs on an underlying basis were well contained growing by only 4 percent compared with the first half of 2007 and down by 2 per cent on the second half
2855800 hsbcs commitment to maintaining its financial strength is unwavering hsbc remains both strongly capitalised and liquid the tier 1 capital ratio was 8 8 percent and tier 1 capital grew by us 6 2 billion during the period
2855801 we have maintained our key credit ratings generated good profitability in adverse market conditions and continued to focus investment on our strategic priorities
2855802 our principal concerns in this environment have been risk management strict cost control supporting our customers and continued investment to support our long term strategic ambitions
2855803 our broad based and resilient revenue streams continue to provide a stable platform from which to achieve strong long term performance
2855804 our geographic balance and broad customer base is a protection which allowed us in difficult markets to achieve a pre tax profit of us 10 2 billion albeit 28 per cent lower than in the first half of 2007
2855805 we live in uncertain times but we have a clear strategy that we are implementing in a focused and effective way in april hsbc was named the number one company in the forbes 2000 list of the worlds largest companies the first time a non us company has topped the list we were also named the number one bank of the bankers top 1000 world banks 2008 for total tier 1 capital
2855806 young people in cayman need to be guided in the right direction and that starts in the home
2855807 parents have a responsibility to raise offspring in a positive environment so that when they in turn have children they can continue the trend
2855808 we have good role models in cayman but they need to be seen
2855809 i can tell you that theres nothing better than standing on the podium with our flag wrapped around my shoulders its a great feeling but this is a close second
2855810 i plan on continuing to speak at camps and comparable functions for that is just as much my duty as representing cayman
2855811 it needs a lot more planning and a lot more negotiations
2855812 sorry got carried away there attribute it to age and experience
2855813 the chrc is experiencing growing pains the world is changing and the commission has to change with it growth isnt always easy sometimes its messy but to cut the chrc off at the knees as it goes through the growth process would be a grave mistake
2855814 permit me to disagree as an alumnus of interrupted or unfinished revolutions i suggest the mistake isnt cutting off institutions such as the chrc at the knees but letting them stand cut them off i say preferably with a submachine gun followed by a stake through the heart
2855815 i suggest the mistake isnt cutting off institutions such as the chrc at the knees but letting them stand
2855816 following successive quarters of sustained growth over a number of years this quarters results are disappointing while our core fee generating businesses continued to perform well global market conditions proved challenging
2855817 as reported to shareholders in our 2007 annual report and our q1 2008 earnings release the group has provided assistance through credit support agreements to a related party those agreements along with the write down of one holding in our held to maturity portfolio that suffered permanent impairment resulted in a loss for the quarter
2855818 the group ceased investing in the us residential asset backed mortgage and related markets over a year ago and does not anticipate that it will enter into any further credit support agreements with the related party when excluding those losses group net income for the quarter would have been 34 3 million for a return on equity of 21 2 percent
2855819 despite the impact of declining market values across many financial sectors the value of assets administered by the group rose by over 9 percent year on year this contributed to strong growth in non interest income up some 11 2 percent to 59 5 million
2855820 as we look ahead to what promises to be a challenging remainder of 2008 we do so with a highly liquid balance sheet as reflected in a loans to total assets ratio of 35 2 percent and a strong capital position which is expected to be boosted later this year by the one time gain projected to be in excess of 110 million relating to the merger of our fund administration business with that of the fulcrum group
2855821 butterfield banks continued patronage allows us to continue assisting cayman youth to achieve something out of life through football fitness technical skills and an enjoyable experience are just some of the things that the kids gain from our club
2855822 i considered myself a good parent and so wanted to try to solve the problem but it wasnt easy first we turned to a private tutor it helped a bit and there was some progress
2855823 but we couldnt really pinpoint what the problem was my husband and i were considering enrolling her in a summer math programme in florida then i went on line and did a lot of research thats how i first heard about sylvan and then i thought that aside from my own daughters needs i felt there was a real need for something just like this for other parents in cayman
2855824 a proportion which ordinary schools just can not match and so this allows us to give lots of individual attention to each of our students
2855825 when parents come here to enrol their children the first thing that we do is give the child a professional assessment
2855826 the next step then is for us to formulate a very specific programme which precisely pin points the students missing skills and this tells us what needs to be done to strengthen the students exact shortcomings
2855827 is that we are constantly rewarding our students when they improve and do well
2855828 in addition to having impeccable teaching credentials all our tutors must have a genuine personal warmth and they must really care about their students
2855829 i know that parents can work long hours and then after work they often have to take their children to band practice or sports events but our teaching sessions are available monday to friday from 10 00am till 7 30pm and we are also open on saturday from 10 00am till 3 00pm
2855830 because they can vary very dramatically depending on the specific level and type of tutoring needed
2855831 can anyone really think of a better investment than that of their own childrens future
2855832 i was seconded from the toronto police service fraud squad to serve with the commercial crime branch of the royal cayman islands police service after my two years secondment was over i decided to stay in cayman
2855833 gcs is a consulting company that provides out sourced compliance services to any business that are required to have anti money laundering aml programmes under the law
2855834 that includes banks fund administrators real estate and corporate service providers
2855835 gcs also provides advice on the prevention and detection of corporate and financial related fraud we conduct internal and background investigations and fraud prevention training
2855836 i would like to develop gcs in other areas of the caribbean in particular the british virgin islands and the turks and caicos i also plan to offer a more comprehensive training schedule starting in january
2855837 the people are very friendly and i never feel intimidated about asking questions of even the most senior people here they want you to succeed and go further and are very helpful if you are willing to push yourself and learn new things the opportunities are here
2855838 i was completely lost at first i had no experience with mutual funds at all the people at dms are very supportive and make you feel comfortable asking questions the working environment is really great although i am still learning i have recently been promoted to corporate administrator which makes all the hard work worthwhile
2855839 working as a corporate administrator is not for everyone the hours can be long and you have to like a busy fast paced schedule but the job is definitely not boring or repetitive it is quite challenging and you are constantly learning about the complexities and variations in all of the required documentation most of our clients are international which means that although much of our work is done from our office via email we are required to think globally
2855840 i get a great feeling of accomplishment each time i learn about a new reporting requirement and the subtle differences between seemingly identical tasks i have learned that once i apply myself i can achieve almost anything
2855841 my years in university really opened my eyes to a broader perspective on life and the world my history and political classes were very important to my personal growth as i began to learn more about other countries and see how events there can impact cayman and vice versa
2855842 think about what is best suited for you and commit to pursuing that goal the work is challenging but if you apply yourself you can definitely do it in the long run you will not regret it i have a two year old son and juggling work and school has been very hard but the people at dms and my family have been very supportive and i will always be thankful for that
2855843 looking back i wish that i had gone straight to college after high school and not gone to work first it has definitely made life much harder to have to finish my schooling now while i am working full time and raising a two year old daughter so i would encourage people to complete all of their courses and get their degree as early as possible working in corporate administration is challenging but if you are willing to work at it you should not be intimidated by the industry in any way
2855844 many local companies claim that their staff are certified pool professionals but in fact i doubt that their claims are true
2855845 when many property owners first put in a pool whether its a private home owner or a large resort they often think of it as a one time investment but its important that they invest in a pools maintenance

2855856 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
2855857 the happy union of these states is a wonder their constitution a miracle their example the hope of liberty throughout the world
2855858 the constitution is the guide which i never will abandon
2855859 a bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government and what no just government should refuse or rest on inference
2855860 this allows ceos to walk in the door and drop 70 100
2855861 more people are involved and i think that necessarily dilutes the impact of any individual which is probably a good thing
2855862 i think we dont want to make too much of his promises on taxes
2855863 once the republicans are vanquished i wouldnt hold your breath waiting for that capital gains tax hike
2855864 the message is that hes going to be a friend to wall street just as bill clinton was a friend to wall street
2855865 wall street will want to be at the head of the table
2855866 they want to make sure theres socialism when they need it bailouts and capitalism when they need that
2855867 i have always been committed to the principle that it is not the duty of government to bail out and reward those who act irresponsibly
2855868 the opening of the mining industry to big international companies is good but they have to be ready in providing social measures for the affected ips indigenous peoples living in these communities
2855869 social responsibility is not only how you spend your money but how you make your money
2855870 the companys responsibility should not stop at what the immediate needs of the people are but must allow them to also develop themselves
2855871 the opening of the mining industry to big international companies is good but they have to be ready in providing social measures for the affected ips indigenous peoples living in these communities
2855872 social responsibility is not only how you spend your money but how you make your money
2855873 the companys responsibility should not stop at what the immediate needs of the people are but must allow them to also develop themselves
2855874 was spotted testing on home soil recently in the uk
2855875 firstly it should be noted that mr palmer has been the subject of a number of disciplinary matters here in bermuda regarding his conduct while a member of the bermuda police service
2855876 these matters are conducted under the direction of the deputy commissioner
2855877 any suggestion of collusion or conspiracy is a complete fabrication
2855878 these matters relate to the internal discipline and are again under the direction of the deputy commissioner
2855879 pc palmer remained a member of the bermuda police service and subject to service discipline
2855880 on wednesday under powers vested in him by the police act the commissioner of police has dismissed pc palmer from police service
2855881 continually misrepresented information and expressed personal views that are inappropriate for a member of the bermuda police service
2855882 will regulate the whole chain of production and distribution of food
2855883 the impact in the first case that we can see is that the state will decide what needs to be eaten when and where
2855884 we dont have a constitution or law and the president does what he wants
2855885 were faced with a dictatorship that carried out a coup detat on the constitution
2855886 in a sense achieving some of the things that he wanted to get in a referendum last year that was voted down
2855887 neither venezuelas citizens nor the national assembly were afforded the opportunity to participate in a debate on these changes
2855888 if we need to survive we must be vigilant these are hard times and we have got to move with these times
2855889 this time i am going do it i am feeling very confident my training is going very well and i have only one aim in mind while i am not focusing on what happened in the past i cant erase it its part of my history but now i have a chance to write a new history i am going out there to win the race
2855890 just being in beijing is great its such a wonderful feeling being at the olympic games even if you are not competing this is special and its an experience to cherish
2855891 fraudulent investments schemes that have involved activities occurring from north dakota to st vincent and grenada west indies and then to switzerland and spain
2855892 he also served as the head of preferred trust and management ltd ptm a grenada corporation with offices in st vincent and grenada west indies
2855893 participate at a higher profit level on investors funds he brought into ptm
2855894 talk about being in the right place at the right time
2855895 i started when i was eight years old they had some tennis courts behind my primary school in freeport i just used to hang out there and just watch the tennis i needed some place to hang around until my parents came to get me
2855896 one day i just decided to play i tried to play at first i wasnt very good and the kids that were there werent nice they would take my racket and throw it over the fence
2855897 i dont want to bother them too much but i want to get as many photos as possible and meet them all it is a once in a lifetime experience
2855898 what usain bolt did earlier this year to run a world record 9 72 put himself on a totally different level to anyone else in the 100 metres
2855899 the guy that can make the most mistakes and win is usain bolt because he is the biggest strongest and fastest guy there
2855900 we are hoping to regroup and find the moral need to make this team of tourist board officers and industry partners function effectively to encourage the tourist trade and tourist investment in the virgin islands
2855901 we want to keep the youths drug free off the streets and make sure academics is priority
2855902 we plan to have basketball youth rallies basketball camps after school programmes and basketball tournaments we also will be ensuring that dedicated basketball athletes pursue their ultimate goal which is playing college basketball and then pro basketball
2855903 digicel is keenly interested in supporting sporting events here in the bvi
2855904 while digicels core sponsorship areas are cricket and football we know that basketball is one of the high interest sports in this territory and as such we feel proud to be able to partner with the foundation to host this event
2855905 i will criticise any minister of the government or member of the police force who is not doing their duty it is my responsibility
2855906 we are an active and a complying member of various international organizations such as the oecd the egmont group the financial action task force fatf and the caribbean financial action task force cfatf
2855907 the financial sector of the netherlands antilles is broadly healthy
2855908 the ec claims it cannot intervene on our behalf to correct the above mentioned unjust inclusion on black lists of some eu members because eu members are autonomous in their tax matters this statement seems very curious especially when we note that in the case of imposing actions to promote what the eu calls good tax governance the ec does have the authority to act on behalf of the eu members
2855909 why does the argument of autonomy of the individual eu member not apply when the eu takes actions to promote good tax governance on the netherlands antilles and why does it apply when the netherlands antilles request the ec not for a favor mind you but to simply correct an error that has been made by some eu members
2855910 recognising the achievements addressing the challenges and getting back on track to achieve the mdgs by 2015
2855911 the government has made education the central plank of its developmental programme and has buttressed this philosophy with massive financial and legislative commitments
2855912 st vincent and the grenadines had achieved universal access to both primary and secondary schools
2855913 between 2001 and 2006 st vincent and the grenadines went from having only 39 of eligible children attending secondary school to achieving universal access to secondary education
2855914 universal access to both primary and secondary schools the universal access to secondary education
2855915 this demonstrates that prime minister gonsalves efforts in providing education for his family have been extremely successful
2855916 he wants to win like everybody else in this team but he also has an emotional reason which is being an olympic champion just like his father
2855917 i had to catch my feet i was always chasing his tail he had quick feet
2855918 we in the pnc recognize burnham as a visionary who was a founding father of an independent guyana his vision was to establish a egalitarian society where all races would enjoy social justice and political and economic emancipation
2855919 burnham was a failure he was a success he was a builder he was a destroyer he was a strategist and he was a schemer
2855920 we hope we can be celebrating your anniversary next year and in years to come
2855921 locsins privilege speech reeks of anti muslim hysteria its very irresponsible for a statesman to attack religion and culture on the basis of hearsay and very dangerous for it foments religious bias
2855922 a government that does not reflect the wishes of its people is a bad one we do not have pit to one religion with the other just so we could cover the sins of our present government
2855923 under the arroyo administration our communities are being pulled back in the dark ages we are stripped of our civil and political rights and were made fall guys for anti terror policies
2855924 the autonomous region in muslim mindanao armm remains one of the poorest region the highest in illiteracy rate and with the people barely surviving because of the high prices of basic commodities
2855925 no mam theyre very sweet pomelos theyre fresh from davao
2855926 the greens are for increased income mam your business will thrive youll never run out of money
2855927 kung sa kabila ng pagkukundisyon sa isipan ng publiko na ramdam ang kaunlaran ay hindi makaila ang malawakang kahirapan at pambubusabos ng gobyerno if amidst the conditioning of the public mind about the supposed economic progress people feel the widespread poverty and the glaring government abuses in their midst
2855928 add a new web to the solution for hosting the control
2855929 you get angry and youre like im going to prove some people wrong hopefully turn some heads view a slide show of the 2008 summer olympics in beijing view slide show of u s mens basketball defeating china 101 70 browse a gallery of images from the olympic opening ceremonies find previews schedules notes medals and tv listings for each day of the summer games discuss the beijing games on all things olympics blog learn more about olympic sports and their tactics find the latest results from the summer games complete coverage of the beijing games we try not to think about that too much we just try to go out there and do our jobs
2855930 we go out there and do our job everybody is confident in what theyre doing
2855931 in that three up three count format pressures a little more elevated but i think were going to be able to handle it
2855932 if i can get paid to do that then im in
2855933 i was thinking about stuff you could send snacks clams oysters stuff like that
2855934 the house of one of our members in midsayap was lobbed with an old grenade that fortunately did not explode
2855935 he is barking at the milf for mapping out the villages that would constitute the bangsamoro ancestral domain to veer away christians and lumads attention at how he is stripping them of their land
2855936 as a government official pinol should be made responsible for the harassment and violations committed by his remarks about reviving vigilante groups in his province
2855937 government officials are fermenting unnecessary fears in the public by beefing up security for the armm and accusing the milf of intervening in the armm elections
2855938 if the arroyo administration is really for peace in mindanao then it should resume its talk with all revolutionary forces in mindanao
2855939 this would help dispel misconceptions about muslims and christians fighting over land in mindanao said lidasan
2855940 government projects or any other voluntary dealings entered into by the government and private individuals corporate entities or institutions
2855941 we can go into a company if they need help with a security awareness program
2855942 there are an amazing amount of things that we could see by watching the traffic go by
2855943 we were saying there are so many of them they are everywhere
2855944 weve identified and blocked the ability to link to the malicious websites from anywhere on facebook less than 002 percent of people on facebook have been affected all of whom we notified and suggested steps to remove the malware
2855945 the more reports we get the easier it is for us to respond decisively
2855946 no facebook employee will ever ask for it and no one else should know it if you are ever prompted to log in to facebook make sure its from a legitimate facebook web address if something looks or feels off go directly to www facebook com to log in
2855947 it just caused a chain reaction of emotions jealousy you can talk to your brother hear him laugh hug him yell at his kids whatever
2855948 coal is the dirtiest and most inefficient fossil fuel there is
2855949 rbs is providing the financial means for companies to build unabated coal fired power stations and dig new coal mines all over the world yet still refuses to disclose full information on the fossil fuel projects it helps finance or to take any responsibility for the emissions that result
2855950 people are coming from all over the country to protest against the proposed new coal fired power station at kingsnorth if rbs and the other banks dont stop financing such climate trashing projects they risk a similar public backlash
2855951 most significant impact on climate change is the investment and lending decisions we make
2855952 banks have a duty to give the public a full disclosure about fossil fuel financing so that account holders can choose whether they want their money to be used to support new coal projects like kingsnorth power station
2855953 we fund a balanced portfolio of generation assets that covers a spectrum from being the biggest funder of renewable generation projects globally to also supporting the oil sector which supports 300 000 jobs in the uk and our generation sector on which the uk depends
2855954 if we get to a four degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase
2855955 the problem in the past has been the expense of geothermal energy generation
2855956 the pipes affect the migration of wild animals and where we can graze our cattle
2855957 now they are drilling wells on either side of our valley it scares off the animals also the vegetation has changed
2855958 the huge benefits of course are that you are getting indigenous electricity which doesnt rely on expensive oil imports
2855959 the other benefit is that you dont get any co2 emissions
2855960 we have intensified exploration of geothermal resources because we want to find a way to bring the cost of power down and hopefully bring in investors by 2030 at least 80 percent of kenyans will have power
2855961 to keep arctic silver 5 fresh for future applications always replace the cap on the syringe after each use the syringe should be stored tip down so that any separation between the particles and suspension fluid will be at the back end of the syringe like any mix of particles that are many times heavier than the suspension fluid there will be some separation in the compound over time when stored in the original syringe because all thermal compounds eventually experience some separation in storage storing in a cool place like a refrigerator will also lessen the separation over time however this does not affect the performance of the un separated or remixed compound
2855962 we have evaluation teams always looking at issues well certainly take a look at this one all chips have errata and there could be an issue that needs to be checked possibly wed have to investigate his paper
2855963 i think if people are aware about bugs they will force intel to fix them
2855964 i was asked to not make poc code publicly available and i think this is a good point i was asked to not reveal tech info but i disagree because installing protections on the isp side will prevent all possible attack s revealing tech details will not cause chaos and mass attacks so im going to reveal a lot of but not all
2855965 one of the projects that the young ba needs to produce is an extract report layout that is to be sent to a mainframe for storage in an archiving repository
2855966 use fixed length lines with the fields in fixed width columns using a fixed width font like courier
2855967 its difficult to explain to the young ba that the whole report must use the same size font throughout and even the spaces between the columns must be a fixed number of spaces and that all that hard work with a gui editor could have been done so much quicker with notepad
2855968 i got a notification that to activate my new online banking i would have to visit the bank in person
2855969 we can state at this point that 6 million is available and that the new investment company will settle the outstanding debts of manabars technologies limited
2855970 we are still investigating the company and the email would be of interest to us
2855971 but whether they have to or not depends on if they are offering securities to the public and if they are relying on an exception
2855972 if we found a breach we would report it but we havent done that at this stage
2855973 you can wait for it and you can have it in good quality you know you can get the stuff from bittorent if you want to
2855974 pictured looks like a soft cuddly et to e tales eyes
2855975 theres unquestionably a move around the world for broadcasting and telecommunications regulation to converge and there is interest in that in new zealand
2855976 that would point to a future where there is a minister of both ict and broadcasting
2855977 and if we dont win the election no one will have any sort job but ill be happy to do whatever im offered
2855978 were not even thinking about portfolios at the moment weve got a massive task ahead a lot of door knocking a lot of hard work in the electorates and whatever happens after that well worry about then
2855979 no ones sure how the technology is going to play out i dont know that that is an issue for government to get involved in i dont see it as governments role to get involved in a rush to regulation
2855980 both the freeview block and sky have various bargaining chips to negotiate with i can see why the public would want a programme on freeview but i think you start setting a real precedent if you rush in and regulate private businesses
2855981 if you look at the difference before the charter and after youd have to say there is no difference
2855982 we believe opening that money up to competition will result in a far higher standard of projects receiving that funding and its going to result in better public broadcasting content on new zealanders screens
2855983 at the end of the day the public doesnt care whether the content is on tvnz on tv3 or on maori tv as long as they have access to it
2855984 the effect of the charter will be that tvnz will no longer have a set of legislatively mandated priorities that it has to report to parliament on
2855985 new zealand on air is very successful at getting stuff on the screen that reflects new zealand society and fulfils the requirements that the charter was meant to fulfil
2855986 its easy to talk about but hard to achieve but if you can actually achieve decent information flows between primary and secondary providers and across providers its going to result in far more timely accurate and cost effective patient care
2855987 grandfather clocks are not your average clocks in fact they are much much more
2855988 oh lets cut from the basketball and talk to someone about how their event went
2855989 het is prettig dat we niet afhankelijk zijn van andere landen we hebben alles in eigen hand als we van japan winnen ga ik er vanuit dat we gewoon doorgaan
2855990 gelukkig is japan al uitgeschakeld anders was er ook nog een vierde land in de race geweest voor een kwartfinaleplaats
2855991 if you dont measure these emissions you cannot manage them
2855992 working together and with the best data we can manage this problem
2855993 the process should really lead to the beginnings of a fundamental restructuring of how cities consume energy
2855994 cities compete in the market for business investment talent all sorts of things and finding ways to profit by tackling climate change can make them attractive
2855995 the result will be a significant drop in brazils farm exports
2855996 if you dont measure these emissions you cannot manage them
2855997 working together and with the best data we can manage this problem
2855998 the process should really lead to the beginnings of a fundamental restructuring of how cities consume energy
2855999 cities compete in the market for business investment talent all sorts of things and finding ways to profit by tackling climate change can make them attractive
2856000 app is widely considered the worst fibre manufacturer in the world
2856001 it leaves open the possibility that as soon as they think the coast is clear they will go back to selling unsustainable product made by asia pulp amp paper
2856002 it will not deal with the many satellites of asia pulp amp paper to assist them to launder illegal or unsustainable timber by routing it through different operations and countries
2856003 transparency is the only way for woolworths to demonstrate that it is genuine in its sustainability intentions and after so much pressure its the least consumers and shareholders should expect
2856004 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
2856005 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
2856006 saya selalu mengatakan bahwa saya sangat senang berada di chelsea
2856007 ini adalah tim yang hebat dengan pemain besar serta pelatih yang hebat semuanya akan berjalan dengan baik di sini saya masih terikat kontrak dua tahun dan saya akan menghabiskannya dengan mereka di chelsea
2856008 if they had a contractor buddy who needed to get rid of cement theyd say bring it on here
2856009 said suzanne goode a senior environmental scientist with the california department of parks and recreation
2856010 those that show up are faced with barriers and bad habitat
2856011 quite often they cannot get back downstream and theyll be trapped in pools that start to dry out
2856012 theyre actually the first ones that evolved and they are able to tolerate the warmer waters that we have in southern california
2856013 this is really significant because of climate change the fish up north cannot tolerate the warm waters so as northern streams become warmer we may hold the key to having steelhead trout
2856014 fish show up in places they havent been in years as soon as you give them a place to come
2856015 theres exotic grasses crab grass fruit trees it looks sort of like peoples backyards
2856016 then you have dry creek bed for thousands of feet that has these arundos growing on both sides instead of the willows that it should have

2856040 a friend in need is a friend indeed an enemy in need is hilarious
2856041 has not empowered citizens to check or mitigate our pervasive problems of mass poverty unemployment corruption social inequality injustice rebellion and the environment
2856042 outmoded form of government and dysfunctional political parties sustain our politics of personality patronage cronyism and corruption and without transparency and public accountability
2856043 it will allow people to take greater control over their own lives and satisfy their preferences what they really want

2856046 i will step back from my day to day producing work on american idol and will be devoting my time to a new venture with producing partner simon fuller
2856047 im really leaving american idol i was working 24 7 and then some so there was just no time in creating anything else just talking about it is tough its like giving birth to a baby and letting it go youre an empty nester your children have left you
2856048 our interest was in the facility not in the team
2856049 the loan did not come from aeg sports but through aeg facilities
2856050 we analyzed the situation and concluded that the predators would be locked into nashville for a long time our interest had nothing to do with kansas city but rather in getting the long term management rights to sommet center
2856051 i take responsibility for making an error in judgment regarding del baggios character it was a mistake and it was my fault
2856052 but we certainly were not trying to do anything detrimental to the future of the predators in nashville or anything detrimental to the nhl
2856053 id been assured by boots that the loan had been fully vetted with gary but believing that is just one of the mistakes i made that i regret
2856054 the loan was through aeg facilities and not the corporate ownership of the los angeles kings we had nothing to hide the commissioner not knowing about it makes it looks worse than it is but we have nobody to blame for that but ourselves
2856055 the loan did not come from aeg sports but through aeg facilities
2856056 we analyzed the situation and concluded that the predators would be locked into nashville for a long time our interest was in getting the long term management rights to sommet center

2856058 the loan was through aeg facilities and not the corporate ownership of the los angeles kings the commissioner not knowing about it makes it looks worse than it is
2856059 the loan did not come from aeg sports but through aeg facilities
2856060 the loan was disbursed from my left hand the one i use to jerk politicians around so theyll give us tax free land to build arenas on not the right hand that i use to jerk kings fans around with

2856068 the doctor seeing me said youre really lucky to still be living

2856070 the hypervisors are commoditising and we view them as a necessary part of the stack
2856071 the focus needs to be on the information thats valuable
2856072 we always give thanks to god for all of you and mention you in our prayers constantly
2856073 sampling frequency should be at least five to ten times as high as the highest frequency component of the signal
2856074 boards on the bench that i use as secondary communications devices when developing projects that require serial communications having a second controller to send rs232 messages to the primary target board is quite convenient

2856076 the worst thing that happens to you can be the best thing for you if you dont let it get the best of you

2856088 we want to have commercial relationships with lots of companies and it matters more that we have that than exactly how much dollar per user were getting

2856319 the discovery of liquid water on mars combined with earlier discoveries of organic substances in a meteorite that came from mars and also of methane in the martian atmosphere all point to the existence of life contemporary life on the red planet
2856320 i am not speaking of fossilized life but contemporary life
2856321 even as early as 1976 when the two nasa space probes viking 1 and viking 2 landed on mars experiments carried out in situ pointed strongly to the existence of active microbial life
2856322 in one experiment nutrient broth was poured onto a sample of martian soil and it frothed up so vigorously exuding carbon dioxide that a positive detection of life might have been inferred
2856323 but when the nasa scientists looked for organic material the detritus of living organisms around the landing site their experiments yielded negative or ambiguous results so nasa cautiously concluded no organics means no life detected
2856324 but 32 years on my friend gil levin who was principal investigator on this project maintains that life on mars was indeed detected in 1976 the experiments of 1976 to detect the dead bodies and decomposition products of bacteria were simply not sensitive enough
2856325 i think there could be political and sociological considerations at work
2856326 firstly if life was already detected then there is no need to spend vast sums of money to continue the search
2856327 secondly there is a lot of scientific interest nowadays in bringing back samples of martian soil to earth at the cost of tens of billions of dollars and there is a lobby that says if microbes exist on mars we should not be doing this it could pose a biohazard

2856386 were looking for the money i think he musharraf has a slush fund being used for this and for some activity for the future
2856387 they spent all the money so we would have to borrow they didnt pass on the increased price of oil nor added a single extra megawatt of power in the last 10 years all these things were deliberately thought out so at the end of day they can turn round and tell the world look democracy doesnt deliver and step back in

2856436 barack obama has been criticized for acting as though he is already president thats natural since the actions in question have been presumptuous the pseudo presidential seal the speech in germany and so on today one might say that john mccain is acting as though he is already president but in a substantive and positive way in his response to russias invasion of georgia mccain is giving us a preview of what sort of president he would be

2856469 there is a sense of anger frustration and great sadness theyve waited for this evidence of sightings for a long time its work they could have started 15 months ago but this is the time for them to keep focus and consider everything carefully before deciding what course of action to take then they will have their day they will make their views clear

2856474 intelligence suggests that a paedophile ring in belgium made an order for a young girl three days before madeleine mccann was taken somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium the purchaser agreed that the girl was suitable and maddie was taken
2856475 one must suppose that the child madeleine mccann could have died inside the apartment
2856476 the whole attitude throughout was one of we think theyre involved there are some vague indications lets throw caution to the wind and see if we can get a conviction
2856477 the documents are a field of potential leads and any one of them could unlock the case they will never give up the search for madeleine
2856478 a network with all kinds of criminal activities really does exist but the authorities dont want to look into it
2856479 in general paedophiles ask for a particular type of abuse rather than a particular child
2856480 the majority of sexual abuse occurs in the home or by people the child knows
2856481 the military institution says it is ok to kill and use the most horrible weapons and that killing the enemy is heroic
2856482 i respect dick for having humanity over his military obligations
2856483 the regular people and the government wanted to surrender but the military people didnt want to surrender
2856484 i believe it is the stubbornness of the military people that caused the bombing of japan

2856495 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2856496 this is a big wake up call for mr rudd
2856497 this is an extraordinary swing and it underlines the disillusionment australians are seeing and feeling with the lack of leadership from the new federal labor government a government that promised so much
2856498 last year kevin 07 was everywhere dripping with empathy draping himself across petrol station forecourts shopping centre aisles promising to stop prices going up
2856499 and all weve got is one watch after another fuelwatch grocerywatch and who knows what the next watch exercise will be
2856500 he promised action and delivered nothing thats why australians are so disillusioned
2856501 i dont think that we can construe from the northern territory some grand lessons for western australia
2856502 obviously were going to wait and see the results to be finalised during the course of this week
2856503 obviously generally the public says to politicians they want them to serve their term and get the job done
2856504 but circumstances can bring early elections on and thats whats happened in western australia
2856505 nevertheless when elections come and go theres always a lesson for politicians in them
2856506 look ill give you whatever support you need including staying completely away from you
2856507 but of course this is not for everybody just like the mac is not for everybody it is targeted to a specific segment of the market
2856508 but were not going to wimax because we want to ditch 3g
2856509 we will continue to invest in 3g as weve already allocated a us 450 million capex capital expenditure for this
2856510 theres always the saying that you do the plumbing ahead of putting in the gear so we have to be proactive with coming out connectivity technology even before the gear is made available

2856514 el copamiento aprista en el estado busca elevar la popularidad del presidente
2856515 bah but they still push tons of other shit food on our kids
2856516 we were not very effective against st mirren you have to congratulate them for the way they played but we didnt have the imagination to break them down and we have to look at ourselves
2856517 i would have thought raising the league flag before the game and the party atmosphere would have inspired the players but that didnt happen
2856518 it could be a good result by the end of the season but as a coach you look at the performance and we will have to work to improve
2856519 im happy to see marc signing as he can pass the ball 15 yards and we couldnt do that very well on sunday
2856520 he brings passing ability imagination and a bit of zest but we have good players here so he will have to work hard before he gets a game
2856521 there is a name every day that is the nature of the business
2856522 i cant answer it because ive not got a direct answer
2856523 its possible we could sign someone this week we are trying weve got one or two options we are looking at and hopefully we can get something done before the start of the season
2856524 it has been pressing since the end of last season we like to operate with four strikers and we have not been able to do that
2856525 rio is now the best centre half in the world by far
2856526 that was an exemplary performance he did not give one foul away and intercepted every ball that came towards him
2856527 he broke out of defence in comfort so many times it was unbelievable he is a magnificent player
2856528 he is 30 now and because he has experience his potential is now being fulfilled in a big way
2856529 i was down and he stamped on me i thought he could have avoided me there was no need for it that was why i reacted and why i grabbed his leg
2856530 we came here with just 18 players and we know we are going to need a bigger squad because of the extra demands on the uefa cup which is new ground for us
2856531 it is going to take a lot for players to play saturday thursday sunday but we have to be competitive phughes699
2856532 if in fact a google property is taking money away from googles partners that is a real problem
2856533 the question in peoples minds is how unbiased can google be as it grows and grows and grows
2856534 when you see knol pages rank high they are there because they have earned their position
2856535 our vision still remains to be the best conduit that we can be connecting people between whatever their search is and the answer they are looking for
2856536 for that reason we are not interested in owning or creating content
2856537 our job which is to organize that information kicks in
2856538 google can say they are not in the content business but if they are paying people and distributing and archiving their work it is getting harder to make that case
2856539 they are competing for talent for advertisers and for users
2856540 assuming that google treats knol just like it treats other web sites it is just another company out there producing content
2856541 we participated in google knol as a test as weve done with other similar offerings
2856542 we are evaluating its effectiveness in further building brand awareness for webmd
2856543 you are continuing to build their business if you do that versus building your own
2856544 if i am a content provider and i depend upon google as a mechanism to drive traffic to me should i fear that they may compete with me in the future
2856545 a lot of the issues that we saw play out between microsoft and its ecosystem in the 1990s will play out again between google and its ecosystem

2856642 on every lap he really got it going on the straightaways but then he went straight into the wall flipped over and then came roaring down the straightaway going the other direction fun to watch but not the best way to win a race
2856643 if you want to go fast you have to give it some thought and figure out whats the best way to really speed yourself up

2856650 and hes going to get playing time are you sure about that im not sure he even got to play on the 1992 team when he was young and presumably decent but theyre going to let him play now this is insane
2856651 what if we need a guy to shoot a turnaround foul line jumper over double teams in under two seconds

2856653 this is without question the best ford lineup weve ever produced and it comes at a critically important time for the company
2856654 our product led transformation is well under way and there is much more to come
2856655 our strategy is clear deliver great new fun to drive vehicles that take a backseat to no one when it comes to quality and fuel efficiency
2856656 in addition virtually our entire lineup benefits from new powertrains ford exclusive smart technology and more safety features
2856657 we are committed to being the best or among the best in fuel economy with every new ford product in its segment
2856658 we are making this happen with one of the most extensive powertrain upgrades ever for ford by the end of 2010 nearly all of fords north american engines will be upgraded or replaced
2856659 ride in a vehicle like the new 2009 ford flex and youll be amazed at the quiet interior
2856660 for many customers not having to speak loudly in the back seat is a significant quality indicator we are improving quality on every front and were serious about getting even better

2856664 most trainers and skilled presenters have a couple of these schticks that they can pull out at the drop of a hat its a very good idea because you never know when you are going to have to fill some dead air because of a technical hitch or a late arrival steve jobs illustrated this really well in his january 2007 keynote his remote clicker stopped working and so did the backup
2856665 so about ten minutes before a company wide presentation is being made it has come to our attention that there is no moderator by the time im found im told that i will need to do it uh crap me is not a public speaker as i will skipsy all over my words or start to babble with some weird fillers no way i cannot remember the last time i spoke to a room with more than six or seven people 200 no
2856666 the point is that if youre supposed to end at a certain time and you dont youll notice the energy level of the room suddenly drop

2856670 its the start of something that can be great weve been waiting for years for this moment
2856671 i dont know how many people were watching the game but it was an honor to play in it
2856672 we were all excited and anxious this game was over the top

2856678 she changes everything she touches and everything she touches changes
2856679 this means the mass of these x ray emitting clouds is much less than we initially thought it was
2856680 a significant portion of what we thought was missing mass turns out to be these relativistic electrons
2856681 the discovery was made while trying to analyze the makeup of warm x ray emitting gas at the center of galaxy clusters the largest cosmological structures in the universe
2856682 if this bump in the data were due to cooler gas it would have emission lines
2856683 the best most logical explanation seems to be that a large fraction of the energy comes from electrons smashing into photons instead of from warm atoms and ions which would have recognizable spectral emission lines
2856684 that could trick us into thinking there is more gas than is actually there
2856685 we have to follow the evidence and if that leads us to confusion well thats ok
2856686 with these first radar observations finished we can guarantee that next weeks 1 4 lunar distance approach is the closest until at least the end of the next century

2856691 we werent expecting to find a stellar mass black hole this massive
2856692 it seems likely that black holes that form from dying stars can be much larger than we had realized
2856693 black holes which are thought to lie at the heart of many galaxies and can have masses of million to billions times that of our sun new record holder
2856694 any refinements in the ic 10 x 1 measurement are likely to increase the black holes mass rather than reduce it
2856695 massive stars in our galaxy today are probably not producing very heavy stellar mass black holes like this one
2856696 but there could be millions of heavy stellar mass black holes lurking out there that were produced early in the milky ways history before it had a chance to build up heavy elements

2856701 the primary complaint against bd seems to be the region coding
2856702 this study puts cold water on any concerns that we are looking for a single gay gene or a single environmental variable which could be used to select out homosexuality the factors which influence sexual orientation are complex
2856703 overall genetics accounted for around 35 per cent of the differences between men in homosexual behaviour and other individual specific environmental factors that is not societal attitudes family or parenting which are shared by twins accounted for around 64 per cent in other words men become gay or straight because of different developmental pathways not just one pathway

2856722 without such information an attack is unlikely to significantly delay irans mastery of enrichment with gas centrifuges
2856723 iranss decision to disperse and keep secret several of its key sites further hinders the development of a full picture of its centrifuge complex
2856724 considering the modular replicable nature of centrifuge plants we conclude that an attack on irans nuclear program is unlikely to significantly degrade irans ability to reconstitute its gas centrifuge program
2856725 an emphasis on military responses to this conflict has the effect of discouraging iran from allowing more effective iaea inspections something necessary for the successful conclusion of a diplomatic solution to irans nuclear program
2856726 iran is understandably concerned that more transparency on its part could lead to the u s and israeli militaries gaining better targeting information on its nuclear program
2856727 it is time to set aside the military option and concentrate instead on credible diplomatic approaches to end irans growing nuclear weapons capabilities
2856728 could prompt iran to hasten its efforts to acquire nuclear weapons by embarking on a crash programme
2856729 iran could then build a small centrifuge plant at a secret location capable of producing weapons grade uranium for one or two nuclear weapons per year
2856730 to finance the reconstruction of the facility and continue the current programme without major budgetary consequences

2856791 1 when establishing a new community 2 when introducing a new ritual and 3 when a normally secular space was to be used for a temporary ritual event
2856792 notions of ritual space and patterns of behavior within such spaces seem to be intrinsic to individual aspiration and collective resolution as sectarian groups organize means of rationalizing life and death
2856793 to phrase it another way ritual spaces serve as locales of forced dynamics in which spatial cues trigger a series of concepts and events directed at the hope of achieving an aspired goal
2856794 personal communal and spiritual intentions and purposes and their sacred connection are reaffirmed
2856795 all public events in their creation of limited social worlds are exercises in holism

2856801 the ritual of the theatre is then a meeting place between our imagination and our reason perfect harmony between those two aspects of our minds provides the greatest experience
2856802 in brief performances seem ritual like because they explicitly model the world
2856803 if traditional chinese theater is full of ritual it is not surprising to find that traditional chinese ritual is full of theater
2856804 the whole acting troupe participates in the public offerings that accompany the temple festival
2856805 man found himself indivisible with nature and the so called gods were natural subtle powers
2856806 aristotles explanation of the origins underline the principle that wherever theatre appears it does so as a development of a ritual
2856807 a religious chant sung and danced by a chorus of some fifty make celebrants in honor of the god dionysus
2856808 constructed in alternating rhythms and patterns of a ritualistic nature

2856816 clearly there have been incidents on both sides but this is obviously a planned georgian operation a contingency plan they have had for some time to retake south ossetias capital tskhinvali
2856817 possibly the georgians calculated that with putin in beijing they could recapture the capital in two days and then defend it over the next two months because the russians wont take this lying down
2856818 russia should not be blamed for the fighting but russia should now be pressured not to go beyond its peacekeeping mandate and to ensure that armed militia do not cross the border into south ossetia
2856819 this pushed georgia into a philosophy of self reliance the idea that georgia will be able to regain breakaway entities only by its own means
2856820 the elephant in the room behind this whole story is georgias nato prospects
2856821 it might be a signal to the russians saying that the sochi olympics will not go the way russia wants if there is no progress on the settlement in abkhazia

2856914 the broad theme of the elections has been explained to the agencies
2856915 the contemporary political scenario in india would be reflected in the campaign
2856916 only one agency would be selected and it would be an integrated media strategy
2856917 with nuclear proliferation posing a greater threat along with weapons of mass destruction our unilateral policy of no first use necessitates that india possesses a credible and survivable nuclear deterrent including submarine launched
2856918 though it is an operational submarine akula will be basically used for training naval operators before they get to operate our indigenous nuclear powered submarine
2856919 ensuring a secure and peaceful environment in the indian ocean region and to further indias political economic diplomatic and military objectives are navys responsibilities we will deter conflict through conventional and non conventional strength but if this fails we will fight to achieve decisive victory over our adversaries
2856920 the risk of conventional conflict also looms large over the sub continent therefore we expect our neighbour to operate on all spectrums of conflicts threats are many transient and dynamic
2856921 by 2022 we plan to have 160 plus ship navy including three aircraft carriers 60 major combatants including submarines and close to 400 aircraft of different types this will be a formidable three dimensional force with satellite surveillance and networking to provide force multiplication
2856922 we wanted to have a mechanism where a common person can get a sim card without any hassles and other security concerns are also met

2856925 our grand old musharraf has not been passing on all the 1 billion dollar a year that the americans have been giving for the armed forces we are talking about 700 million a year missing the rest has been taken by mush for some scheme or other and we have got to find it
2856926 we will prepare a comprehensive and solid chargesheet that musharraf will not be able to fight it it is very necessary that he resigns himself otherwise the impeachment will start
2856927 rituals have their own place in society but cannot be allowed to overtake individual faith
2856928 not being a buddhist in view of his having not performed dhammadiksha ceremony does not seem to be very sound in the present circumstances more so as the very concept of caste and rituals stand diluted in buddhism
2856929 i hold that a fraud had been played in a systematic and planned manner on the part of the appellants to grab the munirka budh vihar which is a branch affiliated to the buddhist society of india
2856930 there cannot be any denial that the name of munirka budh vihar and munirka budh vihar trust are deceptively similar to each other

2856936 the last time so and so faced this pitcher he also hit a home run
2856937 this game is so big not many people can say they won the mvp from the aflac all american game
2856938 it was a great job by the guys because early on it looked like they the west team had all the momentum
2856939 and then finally we woke up a little bit and had a couple of breaks go our way and pulled it out that was a great character win right there
2856940 knsg puts paid promise distributes 1278 computers to tertiary triumph
2856941 thats the first time that a walk off hit ever happened to me
2856942 thats just a great feeling all the guys are on top of you jumping on you and punching you thats the only time i think when you get punched it doesnt hurt this is definitely a confidence booster especially having not played that much
2856943 hes a power hitter so i just tried to make them pay and it worked out
2856944 i knew he was at least going to going to get up there and battle i think he might have half expected i was going to pinch hit for him
2856945 the easiest way to describe that game was we gave it away
2856946 early in the game late in the game it was probably as bad a defense as you can play the first two runs they got was ridiculous a chopper back to the mound and were not covering first base
2856947 we missed opportunities to score but still if we catch the ball and get the outs were supposed to get thats a w not a loss
2856948 you can slice it and dice it and word it anyway you want but it cost us the game you know we got closer joe nathan coming in right there and you know how well hes done this year so ill take that one for the team for sure it stinks but thats the way it is
2856949 i went to throw to second and you know i wasnt 100 percent sure that we had him there and then i go to first and really i probably should have just ran all the way
2856950 the twins pitch well scratch out runs and play good defense
2856951 thats how they win games today they made a few errors and the wild pitch and luckily we were able to do something with it when they made those mistakes

2857047 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2857048 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
2857049 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
2857050 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
2857051 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
2857052 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
2857053 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town
2857054 the national western stock show isnt partisan it doesnt take sides
2857055 its an opportunity to bring people of all different backgrounds culture races together thats what the west is really about
2857056 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward

2857061 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
2857062 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town
2857063 whats more obscene the official position that water boarding is not torture or our official position that its a thrill ride
2857064 its great working with an independent developer on a video for their software they take great pride in their product and great interest in what we do making our job much easier and very effective
2857065 it was even lorenzos idea to put me in front of the camera for this video as a tutorial host that helps move the video along
2857066 i hear some folks at apple are now calling me iphone bob junior

2857071 every election there is a deluge of complaints of alleged registered voters who are not able to vote for various reasons while some claims could be meritorious some could also be a ploy designed to discredit the election process

2857079 it seems that somebody wants to create trouble there but it situation has been addressed
2857080 although there is fighting now in north cotabato it is not spilling out into maguindanao everything seems to be okay there
2857081 it deserves utmost attention especially on the part of the senate where the bill needs full concurrence the action of the house almost came unnoticed by the unsuspecting public because of the unusual silence during committee deliberations and until it finally passed the third reading the stealth in the way the bill passed the house is perhaps worth examining
2857082 alluded to people who cornered the transco sale as those who were also behind his ouster
2857083 now why the deafening silence in the house where were the honorable members of the house and also where was the former speaker who vowed to expose people he wanted to unmask we do wonder
2857084 definitely the transco franchise bill does not fall to the first category
2857085 did money also flow in the house with the passage of transco franchise bill
2857086 fdc is opposed to the privatization of transco because we believe that as a natural monopoly and considered the backbone of the industry it properly belongs to the state and must remain under its control moreover rates are also expected to rise as a consequence of privatization as investors would try to recover their investments the soonest time possible
2857087 we also believe that placing the 21 319 circuit kilometers transmission lines nationwide under a private operator is a national security concern
2857088 ito nakakatuwa naghihintay ng voting at 7 a m nagbabasa parang nagre review sa exams it is heartening to see voters waiting for their turn at 7 a m and reading the instructions as if reviewing for an exam

2857091 wala tayong nakikitang signs na napapansin toward a major eruption importante ngayon pwedeng ito ay patuloy na abnormal activity o pwede ang pag akyat ng magma so far we have not seen any sign of a major eruption it is possible that the volcano has abnormal activity or magma is rising to the surface
2857092 we have no plans to insert money into either of those two institutions
2857093 given that fannie mae and freddie mac are solely involved in housing thats their sole business and given the magnitude of the housing correction weve had its not a surprise to me to see those losses
2857094 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor here in treasury
2857095 we have got some serious issues that were dealing with in our economy

2857105 maybe no artist really can respond to that actual inhuman day that day that makes so many of us so upset still that will maybe make some of us upset to the point of tears to the day we die even just by bringing it up maybe there simply is no decent artistic response to the actual events of that day and maybe there simply never will be
2857106 my god how is it that we all fell under such a weird dark spell for so long

2857109 ich wei nicht was es war denn der stopp selbst war okay trotzdem haben wir ein paar pl tze verloren und wenn du drau en f nf oder sechs leute berholen musst an denen du schon vorbei warst dann ruinierst du dir deine bremsen
2857110 tollen tag mit einem fantastischen auto wir hatten in den letzten rennen so viele probleme dass wir unbedingt ein gutes rennen gebraucht haben um in der fahrerwertung boden gut zu machen
2857111 von startplatz 25 aus in die top 5 zu fahren lag an juan und der guten crewarbeit aber das auto war schnell genug um das rennen zu gewinnen insofern bin ich ein klein wenig frustriert

2857128 last year kevin 07 was everywhere dripping with empathy draping himself across petrol station forecourts shopping centre aisles promising to stop prices going up
2857129 and all weve got is one watch after another fuelwatch grocerywatch and who knows what the next watch exercise will be
2857130 i dont think that we can construe from the northern territory some grand lessons for western australia
2857131 obviously were going to wait and see the results to be finalised during the course of this week
2857132 obviously generally the public says to politicians they want them to serve their term and get the job done but circumstances can bring early elections on and thats whats happened in western australia

2857140 i think ive been doing it for so long they expect it now
2857141 i got started because i didnt like that with the aids disease people were politicizing a health care issue i wanted to push against that
2857142 since then ive done it because it is such a great community and a great event
2857143 i did a thousand little things it feels like everything i could think of
2857144 its all about doing something i never thought i could do
2857145 ive ridden thousands of miles in the last two years training
2857146 the four days really gave me an opportunity to get to know the people the people affected by hiv and aids
2857147 the love that people showed and expressed within those four days was really amazing the commitment as far as giving their all the sincerity and the loyalty its just so amazing
2857148 i think too many people have forgotten that aids is still with us and there are still new cases of it
2857149 people continue to need support and the public needs to be reminded
2857150 it certainly indicates a trend which i think has been apparent in past elections as well particularly 06
2857151 it appears that the smart money is moving more toward democrats or at least covering both bases
2857152 it still comes down to what kind of candidates you have and how hard theyre working
2857153 the assembly is definitely in play and i think everyone understands that
2857154 im excited to see so many of our candidates with strong war chests who will be able to tell their story no matter what anybody else does
2857155 if the democrats take the assembly theyll be able to get a lot of their priorities through that they havent in the past

2857165 one of the results of our historical sketch will in fact be that the failure of the banking community to function in the way required by the structure of the capitalistic machine account for most of the events which the majority of the observers would call
2857166 perhaps not as doomed as trying to prove the world is flat
2857167 one thing i can say is that i sure hope it doesnt work because if you could extract energy from the vacuum it would mean that the vacuum is not stable for normal physicists
2857168 the definition of the vacuum is that its the lowest energy situation possible it has less energy than anything else
2857169 would mean the universe is far more unstable than we ever dreamed

2857180 the faculties of the mind itself have never yet been distinguished and defined with satisfactory precision by all the efforts of the most acute and metaphysical philosophers
2857181 when a person suffers a stroke time is of the essence
2857182 at the end of the day the treasury did not brief this story so we did not cause this problem
2857183 the protection of those least able to heat their homes is a priority for the government we will continue to work with energy companies amongst others on measures to help the most vulnerable to reduce the amount of energy they use and to lower their bills

2857201 this is a historic event where for the first time china is investing directly in agricultural research in canada to advance a crop important to both countries
2857202 this collaboration will help canada and china develop higher yielding canola increasing both our countries reputations for scientific excellence in agricultural research and creating a competitive advantage for canadian and chinese agricultural producers
2857203 this agreement makes eminent sense given that canada is where canola was developed
2857204 food and energy shortages are an escalating problem and increasing canola productivity is something that can help these global issues
2857205 i was relieved na parang finally i even told her this na parang i dont know why pero dati parang may slight
2857206 she kc was really saying hi to juday theyre so close ni juday para silang magkapatid then they joined us in our table
2857207 not recently but the day after weve met each other i mentioned before we texted each other thats nice of her
2857208 no actually i asked for her number from ryan and she asked for my number from juday
2857209 i wouldnt know when she asked for my number but then we texted each other the next day
2857210 oo hello kumusta and yun nga we repeated lang na hay naku mabuti na lang weve finally met each other na ang galing
2857211 we havent seen each other lately naman here sa set and shes very busy i know so parang hindi pa naman kami nagkakasalubong again after that time
2857212 wow if i have no work and im free for sure ill watch the movie or even if i dont get to watch the premiere night ill make it sure na i got to watch
2857213 actually for me ha parang never naman nagkaroon ng gap kasi hindi talaga kami magkakilala
2857214 and then when we made kuwento nga kay mariel luis kay toni na finally im really happy we were so both relieved and shes really really nice to me sobra tsaka ang bait nung sinabi niya na when the press asked her kung papayag siya na iinterbyuhin ko siya sabi niya of course ganyan thats an honor for me if ever to do that so happy happy talaga
2857215 she actually introduced herself to me sabi niya hi im kc sabi ko of course i know and then yun nag rest lang kami and then yeah we just talk
2857216 nagba bye na lahat everyone in the table lahat kami sabay sabay umalis
2857217 oo ano i made it kuwento to him right after weve met i know i texted him about it na o nag meet kami ni kc like that yun lang just to inform him para alam niya
2857218 i dont know but i think hes okey there sa states hes studying there related to directing
2857219 paano akong magkakaroon ng boyfriend e wala ngang nanliligaw sa akin
2857220 hindi ako nagdi deny lang kung halimbawang may boyfriend na nga ako aaminin ko naman yun kaso wala talaga promise
2857221 what if hindi ko pa masasagot ang tanong na yan e hindi ko pa alam kung anong magiging reaction ko kung halimbawang manligaw nga siya sa akin
2857222 sa akin naman kahit sino ke taga showbiz siya or non showbiz basta mabait funny at may paggalang sa parents ko
2857223 hindi ako aware na may sex video siya at hindi ako naniniwala tsismis lang siguro yun
2857224 lahat naman ng mga artistang lalaki na nagsisimula pa lang sa showbiz ay may ganyang tsismis di ba basta hindi rin ako naniniwala na pumatol sa isang gay si matt
2857225 kung halimbawang totoo siguro ang masasabi ko na lang past is past
2857226 ay ayoko hindi kaya ng powers ko yung ganoon hanggang sa tv lang ako magsusuot ng two piece
2857227 nung nasa states ako i was invited to a lot of live shows
2857228 sabi ko hindi naman ako dahil mag e emcee lang ako
2857229 alam mo yung kaba pala kapag kinakabahan ka pala mas gumagaling ka
2857230 pero may nagsabi sa akin na maganda raw na tumira ng isang shot maski raw yung mga singers hindi ko na babanggitin baka sabihin anyway pero totoo pampaalis ng kaba siguro dahil may alcohol content nga
2857231 hindi na ako nag imbita ng kung sinu sino para makasama sa album ko
2857232 hindi naman kung sinu sino nga si kc okay gusto ko ako lang muna ang warner lang naman ang kumontak sa akin ngayon kung ang warner ang kumontak sa kanya at sa iba pa wala na akong magagawa pero wala akong kasama sa cd ako lang ayaw ko rin namang mag imbita ng iba
2857233 however meron akong kanta na come what may yan ang signature song ko becasue sabi ko yan alam ko na alam ng marami dahil yan lang ang naka cd na nakasama sa album ni sharon cuneta gabbys ex wife so sabi ko maraming may alam niyan isama na natin
2857234 she invited me so i cannot say no to that basta i will do anything she wants me alam naman niyang nandito lang ako sa likod niya shadow lang ako nandito lang ako
2857235 alam mo everybody can go to any movie shows concert watch tv there is no law that prevents anyone from going there
2857236 well isa lang ang masasabi ko sa inyo na kung maaari lang sa august 15 puwede ninyong i anounce ang concert ko sa music museum with ai ai delas alas and claudine barretto si ai ai na ang bago kong ka love team kung sila ni erap may kissing scene kami ni ai ai may singing scene
2857237 well kapag ginawa ni ai ai e di okey lang yun hintayin ko na lang kung ano ang mangyayari sa entablado the show must go on di ba
2857238 struggling with things beyond our understanding kasama mga anak ko siyempre pag tinatanong nga sa akin e parang ang hirap sagutin ang how are you
2857239 siguro lahat naman tayo may pinagdaanan na mga taong mahahalaga sa buhay natin na nawala and yung pakiramdam na yun in one way or another ay may pains tayo na pinagdaanan na wounded tayo so siguro maka identify ang lahat
2857240 parang may pinagdaanan ka best friend nauna ka pang lumuluha sa akin
2857241 lt explain mo nga kung bakit ayaw mo na ng isang showbiz oriented na talk show
2857242 kasi parang mahihirapan ako magtanong kasi lalo na doon sa may mga pinagdadaanan kasi i am still healing
2857243 so parang hindi ganoon katatag yung loob ko para magkuwestiyon sa pinagdadaanan din nila most especially when it comes to pain di ba and yung joy is parang oo may panandaliang kaligayahan pero parating kakabit yung sorrow yung grief na dinadaanan namin so medyo mahirap im still my children are still healing and so i am
2857244 ano ibig sabihin noon anak na ayaw mo na ng showbiz oriented show
2857245 di ba mas maganda na siguro yung tina tackle ko is yung more of pagiging ina sa bahay mga ibang aspeto ng buhay hindi tungkol sa mga intriga sa mga dapat kumbaga although siyempre lahat tayo gusto makarinig ng latest di ba yung gustong makarinig ng kung ano na ang nangyayari lalo na sa mga kapwa mo artista parang gusto ko na huwag na alamin yun gusto ko na marinig na lang at hindi na akong maging bahagi
2857246 yung tipong wala ka na sa gitna pero kung may aalok sa iyo na lifestyle talk show okay ba sa iyo
2857247 siguro mas maganda kung sitcom para naman may mas magaan na mawawala sa isip mo yung dinadaanan na proseso ayoko din kasi madaliin ayoko magpa pressure na kailangan mag heal ka na ganoon
2857248 madalas mo ngang sabihin sa akin nay na o tanggalin mo na mga gamit ni rudy hindi ayoko talaga gusto ko nandiyan lang siya
2857249 so hindi mo pa inaayos ang gamit ni daboy hanggang ngayon
2857250 nasanay ako na i always cry alone aaminin ko na last night i cried pero tapos noon wala na nasanay din siguro ako sa pagpigil e yung merong may sandali lang na naiyak ako tapos tapos na dahil kailangang kong tapusin agad
2857251 nag flashback ako dun sa seven days noong nandoon sa bahay si rudy yung pagkatapos naming umuwi galing sa hospital
2857252 yung dalawang bata ba ralph and renz and even mark anthony rudys son with alma moreno mayroon ba silang iyak na hindi mo alam o ipinapakita ba nila ipinapakita nila ang emotion nila how are they basically now
2857253 sa ngayon pare pareho siguro kami bawat pagharap namin theres always a missing part di ba iniisip naming buo kami dahil magkakasama kami pero may kulang talaga
2857254 its like twenty seven years of my life with him so lahat siguro nanamnamin mo ultimong toothpaste at toothbrush kahit maliliiit na bagay pati yung gamot niya hanggang ngayon yung iba nga nagagamit ko medyo physically apektado rin ako so yung ibang gamot niya nagagamit ko na ngayon
2857255 mahirap pala mag interview ng isang taong katulad mo mahirap mahirap bilib nga ako dito kay lolit e siguro dahil close kayo kahit ako hindi kumikibo dito e alam mo ang damdamin ko
2857256 ikaw lolit sasama ka sa holy land o bawal ka doon
2857257 ngayon ko lang nadiskubre na doon sa dalawang taon na may sakit si rudy ang pinakamasakit kay lorna ay yung seven days na inalagaan niya si rudy doon sa bahay
2857258 pinakamasakit na oras ay yung alam kong wala na akong kayang gawin bale june 6 yon a day befor rudys death
2857259 hindi ako nawalan ng pag asa sinurender ko na lang nang buong buo inisip ko na kailangan niya rudy yun na iparamdam sa kanya at ipaalam sa kanya na maging okay kami yun naman ang kadalasan na para hindi mahirapan e sabihin mo na kakayanin nila
2857260 i think yung moment na talagang hindi na kaya ng lahat ng gamot hindi na ng doctor kung papaano patataasin ang blood pressure ni rudy yung gamot kung papaano papasok sa katawan niya yun yung ang moment na pinakamahirap talaga balikan and the final hours before june 7
2857261 pero lt kaya mo na ba kasi all these years si rudy ang padre de familia lahat ng responsibility ay siya ang umaako noon
2857262 talagang ngayon mas madalas ang pag uusap namin at madalas kaming magkakasama pag may panahon at pagkakataon e pinag uusapan namin ang napakaraming bagay at yung nasa loob namin yung nararamdaman namin papaano kami maggo grow together yung kaalaman hindi lang sa nararamdaman pati sa lahat ng bagay at paano kami magtulung tulungan
2857263 inaalam niya sa akin kung sino ang casting pinadalhan niya ako ng script hindi ko nga lang nabasa agad dahil sabi ko ang revised na ang ipadala sa akin at tumutulong ako sa ganoon parang si rudy rin sa kanya i hope kahit papaano e nakakatulong din ako dahil malaki ang naitulong nila sa pamilya namin
2857264 saludo talaga ako kay senator jinggoy senator bong and ipe hindi talaga bumitiw
2857265 sobrang dami ng pagmamahal na itinamin ni rudy na talagang inaani naman namin ngayon
2857266 hindi itong medyo kasi nagpagamot din ako parang mayroon na din akong severe tension headache na sumusulpot sulpot to lighten up my spirit at the same time i go out with friends also pero mas gusto ko sa bahay bahay
2857267 bastat mayroon akong ginagawa kinakausap ko siya basta na may moment ako na tahimik kinakausap ko siya actually dalawa sila ang diyos at siya
2857268 oo nga tumawag nga sa akin anak ko ma gusto akong kausapin ni tito gorgy rula
2857269 si dennis trillo madalas pumunta sa bahay nagugulat ako minsan pag kumatok ako sa kuwarto ng mga bata nandoon siya there was a time na talagang binisita niya si rudy dalawang beses niya binisita si rudy after chemo ni rudy
2857270 ang sabi niya kay nanay lolit tapusin niya muna pag aaral niya pero pag may magandang role e puwede niyang pagsabayin ang pag aaral at pag aartista niya so depende sa io offer na role sa kanya
2857271 its so sad kasi kahit na anong mangyari pag move on ko e parating nandiyan sa tabi ko yung ayokong sabihin alaala e pero slowly but surely yes magmu move on ako kung sino man ang mga kaibigan ko na kasama ko at iba pang kasama ko na bagong kaibigan parang kailangan nilang tanggapin na bahagi sa buhay ko because i will always remember kumbaga kahit anong sitwasyon sa kahit anong dadaanan ko parati kong masasabi ko at mababanggit si rudy i think moving on is not really talking about or thinking about kumbaga yung isasantabi mo hindi ko magagawa isantabi yon
2857272 ito ang madalas kong sabihin sa mga taong takot na mamatay medyo kikilabutan kayo rito huwag po kayong matakot mamatay ang isipin nyo sa kabila doon ay makikita mo ang paborito mong tao halimbawa idol mo si elvis presley ang mga dakilang tao sa kasaysayan si mahatma gandhi kahit na sila hitler may pagkakataon ka makaharap ang mga taong yan mas maganda ngayon dahil may rudy fernandez pa
2857273 sabi nga ni manay susan roces noong wake ni rudy sigurado ako ang ganda ng pelikula na ginagawa nila doon kasama si kuya ron fernando poe jr susans late husband isipin natin na napakagandang pelikula na ginagawa nila kasama ng mga magagaling na director na nandun na
2857274 samsung has grown from a south korean home appliance maker to a top class global brand through olympic marketing hasnt it olympic marketing is a prerequisite for us to become a global brand

2857303 le dijo que el liderazgo de georgia debe largarse que saakashvili debe largarse eso es completamente inaceptable
2857304 es el cambio de r gimen el objetivo de su gobierno el derrocamiento de un gobierno elegido democr ticamente
2857305 los d as en que se tumbaban l deres en europa mediante la fuerza militar se han terminado
2857306 cambio de r gimen es una invenci n puramente estadounidense que nosotros no usamos
2857307 nunca hemos utilizado esta terminolog a en nuestro pensamiento pol tico nosotros estamos por la democracia en georgia
2857308 en ocasiones hay l deres electos democr tica o semi democr ticamente que provocan grandes problemas a sus pa ses y a veces esos l deres tienen que plantearse cu n tiles han sido para su gente
2857309 saakashvili es el l der electo de georgia y todo el pa s ahora mismo lo respalda defenderemos nuestra libertad junto a nuestro presidente
2857310 la retirada de las fuerzas georgianas de osetia del sur y la aceptaci n de un acuerdo para no usar la fuerza
2857311 a n no he visto un borrador de resoluci n as si nos tenemos que unir a una resoluci n tiene que haber algo que podamos aceptar
2857312 al menos el mundo tiene que saber que todos estamos unidos y que es rusia la que est en el lado equivocado
2857313 nuestra idea como la de casi todos era acoger a un beb
2857314 al principio lo de la edad te da miedo pero no fue un problema recompensa el riesgo corrido porque no sabes lo que los ni os te llegan a aportar
2857315 estaban acostumbrados a hacer todo por su cuenta sin consultarlo con nadie y tra an unos h bitos que cost un poco modificar pero al final se adaptaron muy bien
2857316 cuando llegaron era ella la que re a al ni o hasta que se dio cuenta de que esa labor era nuestra
2857317 ella sabe que ya hay quien vele por el peque o y se ha despreocupado
2857318 incluso dar un beso se les hac a extra o
2857319 wir hatten ein richtig gutes auto wir kamen von startplatz 17 und pfl gten durch das ganze feld nach vorne ich glaube dass wir ber weite strecken sogar eines der besten autos im feld hatten
2857320 mit dem letzten satz goodyear hatten wir ein wenig zu viel bersteuern aber wenigstens wieder einmal ein top 5 resultat das ist schon eine ganze weile her
2857321 ich wollte gerade an joe nemechek vorbei als ich pl tzlich einen k hlergrill vor mir sah
2857322 as industrial agriculture characterized by massive capital investment and the extensive use of pesticides and fertilizers is increasingly challenged the future looks increasingly bright for persons engaged in environmentally friendly agriculture including a new generation of organic producers public policy will have to be adjusted to recognize their needs and potential as well as those of the growing number of green collar workers who will inhabit rural canada
2857323 must be on the agenda as the best way for canadians to increase our trade prosperity and leadership potential
2857324 tony jr macht die strategie aber ich denke nicht dass er etwas allzu verr cktes im schilde f hrte
2857325 das gleiche problem wie vor ein paar wochen in sonoma nur hatten wir dort ein paar gelbphasen in denen wir das problem bek mpfen konnten
2857326 mit unserem 1 5 meilen programm machen wir fortschritte aber auf den rundstrecken lagen wir komplett daneben

2857330 but everyone is a criminal who just hasnt yet committed any crimes hmmm
2857331 with his negative ads is obama really a new politician
2857332 republican voters are tired of their leadership walking on eggshells to please the left so any kind of attack ad is a very good thing that will rally the gop base
2857333 nj moderate said i would expect that mccain will run more positive ads once he gets the nomination mccain was never loved not even liked by the republican base so his first order of business was to re assure them that he was not a closet democrat
2857334 jag lade mig n stan p rygg f r att det skulle bli riktigt bra
2857335 we recognize that we are in a difficult position as regards references to people at present on the detached islands we know that a few were born in diego garcia and perhaps some of the other islands and so were their parents before them we cannot therefore assert that there are no permanent inhabitants however much this would have been to our advantage in these circumstances we think it would be best to avoid all references to permanent inhabitants
2857336 we must surely be very tough about this the object of the exercise is to get some rocks which will remain ours there will be no indigenous population except seagulls
2857337 unfortunately along with the birds go some few tarzans or man fridays whose origins are obscure and who are hopefully being wished on to mauritius
2857338 be indifferent to the imposition of foreign rule on people who have no desire for it
2857339 the islands are virtually uninhabited and the erection of the base would thus cause no indigenous political problems
2857340 there is nothing in our files about inhabitants or about an evacuation
2857341 you know bagram air field diego garcia guant namo 16 camps throughout iraq
2857342 someday ill be saturday night fueron dos de los mayores xitos de 1994 con estas dos canciones arrasaron nuevamente con las listas europeas y americanas

2857344 elders future will be built around its core network network related and complementary operations elders rural services managing director mike guerin said
2857345 we have evaluated assets and operations which are peripheral to that or which are unlikely to meet our performance targets
2857346 work is ongoing on other elements of the strategy enunciated by the board with the intention of further divestment of non core assets and realisation of capital within the current financial year chairman stephen gerlach said
2857347 but everyone is a criminal who just hasnt yet committed any crimes hmmm
2857348 i obviously hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem
2857349 to believe that i achieved something they hadnt is very special
2857350 i have no regrets of anything i did out there
2857351 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2857352 i turned to my caddie on 16 and said god this is a lot of fun just to watch
2857353 im not sure i would have been able to handle him in any case today
2857354 no doubt he has talent and hes been able to keep this up for five or six weeks
2857355 its been a good week considering that i was only hitting the ball again a week ago after not being able to move my neck im looking to improve and carry it forward next week in washington
2857356 i played a very good week and i played unbelievable today
2857357 i dont think andy was 100 percent but it is great to play and win here
2857358 other people might look at him with pity but he has dealt with it he could handle anything
2857359 hes living his dream he runs the property he wanted to run he has a daughter and were in the happiest place we have ever been
2857360 if i get upset he lifts me up i couldnt do it without him
2857361 in the back of my mind there was the chance we couldnt have kids after the accident and then the cancer im loving fatherhood its fantastic
2857362 when shes older shell be able to sit on the back of my chair and go for a ride
2857363 theres a thin line between being clever and being stupid
2857364 i wonder if she ever tells that dirty bastard all about me
2857365 the present set of beethoven symphonies is bound to shake up the established image of the composer no beethoven recording in recent years holds so many surprises in store
2857366 with beethoven you have to have the courage to take liberties
2857367 a heart begins to beat in the marble bust of the composer
2857368 its incredibly intimidating if youre a newbie to sit or stand in a room filled with dealers and raise your hand
2857369 we felt the online platform was easier more convenient and a little more anonymous
2857370 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities mr hotchkies said on the sidelines of a notorious annual defcon gathering of hackers in las vegas
2857371 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2857372 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty said hotchkies who saw a spike this year in the number of defcon attendees carrying macintosh laptops
2857373 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2857374 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple hotchkies said
2857375 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2857376 jail break because it liberates iphone models from the shackles of deals apple has with telecom giants providing exclusive service to the devices in varying countries
2857377 it shows people are getting proficient at analyzing apple software hotchkies said
2857378 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised
2857379 i dont think its worth me getting what i would call premature stress over something that may not occur
2857380 but that doesnt mean im not going to give it serious thought in the meantime
2857381 and both said basically you know were not here to sweeten you up about whether you want to support us or not
2857382 i dont think its in telstras interest to be seen to be the company thats still trying to implement work choices
2857383 in a democracy people who want to be a member of a union then the union has got the right to represent them and companies right across the country should recognise that
2857384 we simply want everyone who wants an opportunity to be on a performance based contract to have that opportunity
2857385 theres no need to have someone between us and the employee so this is not about awas or unions its really about how a modern company relates to their employees and if people want to work harder they can make more money
2857386 if someone is trying to squeeze the bitter lemon of work choices its not us
2857387 it will certainly say to telstra and to other companies that if a majority of the employees want to try collectively bargaining then the employer has to join them at the bargaining table and have a go at it in good faith
2857388 this is a big wake up call for mr rudd
2857389 this is an extraordinary swing and it underlines the disillusionment australians are seeing and feeling with the lack of leadership from the new federal labor government a government that promised so much
2857390 last year kevin 07 was everywhere dripping with empathy draping himself across petrol station forecourts shopping centre aisles promising to stop prices going up
2857391 and all weve got is one watch after another fuelwatch grocerywatch and who knows what the next watch exercise will be
2857392 i dont think that we can construe from the northern territory some grand lessons for western australia
2857393 obviously were going to wait and see the results to be finalised during the course of this week
2857394 obviously generally the public says to politicians they want them to serve their term and get the job done but circumstances can bring early elections on and thats whats happened in western australia
2857395 nevertheless when elections come and go theres always a lesson for politicians in them i think the lesson from this election as prime minister kevin rudd has said and its a lesson for all politicians is youve always got to be in touch with the electorate and cant take anything for granted
2857396 this is a big wake up call for mr rudd
2857397 we bocog promised free access except for a few websites that jeopardise our security and the healthy growth of our youth
2857398 thats an assessment made by the authorities of which sites are good and which are not good for our youth its like what any other country does
2857399 however the other day i was asked would i apologise and i said i would not apologise as the ioc do not run the internet in china
2857400 the continued growth of online advertising demonstrates a growing confidence in the medium and importantly shows the increasing inclusion of online advertising in marketers strategic plans
2857401 all segments search display and classifieds continue to grow significantly and the combined total surpassing 1 5 billion for the first time is testament to the strength of the industry here in australia
2857402 to achieve a growth rate of 27 per cent year on year indicates the growing importance of online advertising in the media mix
2857403 there is still much work to be done however to educate and inform key industries yet to fully embrace online advertising in particular fast moving consumer goods retail and government on the effectiveness online advertising plays not only in direct response but also in branding
2857404 advertisers can continue to invest confidently in online advertising knowing their target audience is spending more of their time online and that online advertising offers a cost effective platform to reach and engage with them
2857405 with advertising expenditure exceeding 1 5 billion over a 12 month period for the first time strong growth can be seen across all markets segments
2857406 my subjects range from semi abstract landscapes to complete abstractions with the use of linear expressionist brushstrokes i aim to create movement and excitement while retaining an illusion of depth and in the landscapes of reality
2857407 it appears the banks debt will not be paid from the sale of the assets
2857408 the banks will suffer a substantial deficiency and therefore theres no chance of creditors getting a dividend hence shareholders will not have any likelihood of a return
2857409 still hopeful that we could craft a solution that would meet with the approval of the banks
2857410 time was against us despite everyones best efforts we just couldnt get enough of the turnaround happening fast enough
2857411 but we did give it a red hot go i did also say that whilst there were no guarantees of success that you had my 100 per cent commitment and that of the whole executive team that if we didnt get there it wouldnt be from lack of hard work
2857412 tugas tugas strategis mengartikulasikan partai partai kiri dan tatanan sosial kiri dengan tujuan membentuk suatu front anti neoliberal yang besar
2857413 you me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life but it aint about how hard ya hit its about how hard you can get it and keep moving forward
2857414 even in the face of the darkest nights justice will ultimately prevail
2857415 i could force you to download child porn or send subversive material to china
2857416 the exploitation is almost limitless google has to fix it
2857417 it turns out a lot of people who develop these things arent good at security
2857418 weve been telling google about these vulnerabilities for years and they have not made corrective actions
2857419 they chose to open the doors and insomuch put a lot of consumers at risk
2857420 its great working with an independent developer on a video for their software they take great pride in their product and great interest in what we do making our job much easier and very effective
2857421 it was even lorenzos idea to put me in front of the camera for this video as a tutorial host that helps move the video along
2857422 i hear some folks at apple are now calling me iphone bob junior
2857423 i would work while paris was sleeping email off a script or a video proof go to bed and awake to have input and changes in my email box we kept in contact during the overlapping hours via ichat
2857424 our team takes pride in producing high quality content quickly and affordably many companies have video on their sites these days oftentimes created by themselves we want our clients to have professionally produced content with motion graphics music and voice over that puts their product in its best light
2857425 beer is proof that god loves us and wants us to be happy
2857426 the court ultimately came to a very very wrong conclusion
2857427 the anatomy of a subway hack breaking crypto rfids amp magstripes of ticketing systems
2857428 the first notice that the mbta provided that they were going to the court was after they had gone to the court
2857429 the statute on its face appears to be discussing sending code programs or similar type of information to a computer and does not appear to contemplate somebody who is giving a talk to humans
2857430 reflects the courts view that they believe that the massachusetts bay transit authority was likely to succeed on the merits we think thats actually not the case
2857431 courts have found that the first amendment covers these things
2857432 we believe that this is a protected speech activity when you discuss security issues if you are telling the truth that is something that should be protected
2857433 he seems to pay as much attention to his hairstyle as other young men he often has hair and scalp treatment because he has curly hair and his hair is often damaged by the water in the swimming pool
2857434 beer is proof that god loves us and wants us to be happy
2857435 you come to buy a car from me that practically makes us family call me uncle bobby b baby
2857436 even in the face of the darkest nights justice will ultimately prevail
2857437 will not save you money it will cost you more
2857438 over the next 12 to 18 months theres a very uncomfortable set of circumstances as every vendor rushes out to say weve virtualized
2857439 a virtual switch is just a piece of code like a hypervisor
2857440 it all boils down to three settings in a gui
2857441 nehalem is going to be about more performance and people always want more performance
2857442 if you look at what intel is doing towards desktops and laptops chips by integrating graphics that could very well reduce power consumption
2857443 the core i7 brand is the first of several new identifiers
2857444 when lawyers attack dealing with the new rules of electronic discovery
2857445 there is very little case law and few analogies to be made with existing discovery case law
2857446 is the formula in excel data or data about data
2857447 there are deduplication technologies but they shouldnt be relied on
2857448 its a way to replace the internet for document distribution
2857449 but this is not just about distributing knowledge it is a library of information
2857450 we are planning a pilot project in two months in ghana but we can always use help such as time or financing
2857451 we are on the cusp of seeing what linux did for software repeated on the hardware side
2857452 the difference is that the hardware itself is not free
2857453 what is kosen rufu and how can we achieve it in our lifetimes
2857454 the more we can mobilize this community the fewer patents that will actually be granted
2857455 whatever happens in the patent reform world in the next u s administration is great but we have to act now to stop the granting of patents that threaten linux and open source in general
2857456 a production environment where we educate and train people to do this well work with them to make sure its put in a form that is acceptable
2857457 those are kind of the key areas to linux as it moves forward
2857458 budite svjesni injenice da je cionisti ki re im nakon 60 godina zlo ina nasilja i plja ki do ao svojem kraju te da e uskoro u potpunosti nestati

2857489 the president and mr putin were in animated conversation two seats in front of us and i imagine they had a few things on their agenda
2857490 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2857491 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2857492 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2857493 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2857494 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2857495 we hope that there is no further bloodshed there has been too much bloodshed already
2857496 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2857497 it has to be condemned and the world needs to stand against it
2857498 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2857499 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states

2857506 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2857507 clearly there have been incidents on both sides but this is obviously a planned georgian operation a contingency plan they have had for some time to retake south ossetias capital tskhinvali
2857508 possibly the georgians calculated that with putin in beijing they could recapture the capital in two days and then defend it over the next two months because the russians wont take this lying down
2857509 russia should not be blamed for the fighting but russia should now be pressured not to go beyond its peacekeeping mandate and to ensure that armed militia do not cross the border into south ossetia
2857510 this pushed georgia into a philosophy of self reliance the idea that georgia will be able to regain breakaway entities only by its own means
2857511 the elephant in the room behind this whole story is georgias nato prospects

2857571 i remember back when lincoln center did a bergman festival in i believe 1994 they played everything over a month and a half and i found myself just watching dozens and dozens of his films
2857572 and when you throw yourself into his work like that it does affect you in a profound way the way you stumble out of the theater and shade your eyes from the sun his world is not like our world its transformative and i would really like to think that by stretching out our series over a couple months it gives people an opportunity to dig in to the many different ways he used such issues as faith and art and relationships and betrayal rather than focus on only a few films you can watch bergman grow
2857573 there are a lot of people who feel that theyve done bergman that theyve seen the big ones and thats enough
2857574 but theres a lot more here than some realize it was smiles of a summer night that won him prizes around the world and gave berman his big rubber stamp of approval as an intellectual art house favorite but its his pre 1955 output that has gone underappreciated and might surprise even some longtime bergman fans
2857575 hes a towering figure and i think criterions actually done an amazing job of selecting and enhancing his work on dvd
2857576 but theres something indescribable about seeing bergmans work on the screen with complete strangers of course were big fans of the communal experience in general but something about his films is so intimate and so unsettling in their relationship issues and the way people treat each other that the experience becomes uncomfortable in a special energized way its far different from sitting at home and watching the film on a television a much different contrast when you have this utterly naked bloody intimacy on the screen and youre seeing it with people youve never met before
2857577 new yorkers are very open minded and look for new opportunities to get out of the heat and explore new places
2857578 i have traveled all over the world and i still think that the amount of dance here is more than anywhere else
2857579 yet general people on the street dont have anything to do with the dance world we need to demystify dance
2857580 theres a lot of great dance out there and we want people to know about it we think its our obligation
2857581 there are moments of serendipity when i see something maybe in south korean dance something that looks like waves on the shore and it looks like whats in one of my own modern dance pieces that were performing
2857582 we all have the same anatomy and people have explored this anatomy throughout history in folk dances
2857583 its sort of like beadwork when you see mexican and indian and native american beadwork it makes you realize that theyre all coming from the same place i love the opportunity to break the matrix so that audiences realize they can access other forms
2857584 once you see how people respond and what effect the festival has its impossible to stop
2857585 we get lots of letters and e mails and i recognize people year after year even though i dont know their names i know for example theres a large senior center following older people retirees for them its great to have free events that they can walk to

2857591 my dear brothers take note of this everyone should be quick to listen slow to speak and slow to become angry for mans anger does not bring about the righteous life that god desires

2857758 on the back of this the bank became concerned as to exactly what was happening with investor sentiment in nz
2857759 the bank was very clear that whilst it was prepared to provide capital and additional funding for the business that this was not in any way intended to substitute or underwrite the debenture holders position
2857760 ive never done an ebay auction before so i didnt know what to expect but i am upset and frustrated after someone from bristol bid 10m and ive since found out she hasnt got that sort of money
2857761 ive spoken to ebay and the bid stands there are also bids for 9m on there from other people but if the 10m bid is won then that person wont be able to pay for the estate and the auction will have been a waste of time it feels like people have been scuppering my genuine auction
2857762 my chances of an individual medal were slim so the best i could do was be a strong backup for the rest of the team
2857763 the most important thing was to have a clear round
2857764 if i had a silly run out there at the second last id have kicked myself
2857765 you just dont know how the horse is going to finish weve all been warned about the heat and the effect it has on them
2857766 the last thing i wanted to do was go out too fast early and have a very tired horse at the end
2857767 i went out as quick as i felt comfortable and the horse felt comfortable all the way around
2857768 on reflection i maybe could have gone out a little bit quicker but im happy
2857769 national is committed to a benefit system that is a genuine safety net in times of need we also recognise that many people on a benefit will never be able to work because of illness or disability
2857770 national is going to have an unrelenting focus on work
2857771 paid work is the route to independence and well being for most people and is the best way to reduce child poverty long term welfare dependency locks people into a life of limited income and limited choices
2857772 all long term unemployment beneficiaries will be required to do what it takes to secure employment this may include practical training attending a basic skills course or attending drug and alcohol rehabilitation
2857773 if they dont comply with these obligations their benefits will be reduced in the first instance then suspended then cancelled
2857774 benefit abatement is a necessary part of the system but the high marginal tax rates it creates are a disincentive for people to work even a few hours a week
2857775 essentially pollution reaches peoples lungs even if they stay inside on high pollution days
2857776 there is no escape from wood smoke pollution particularly in older wooden houses during winter temperature inversions in christchurch or anywhere else
2857777 although the health impact isnt great there were small decreases in lung function during very high pollution days for boys with asthma
2857778 this is the first time that this urine test has been used to detect exposure to wood smoke pollution in new zealand
2857779 were in the business of ensuring our city develops in an appropriate way we needed to move quickly to protect that vision and we made the right decision
2857780 the verbally abusive relationship how to recognize it and how to respond
2857781 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off at the moment no apps have been blacklisted but by all appearances this has been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for if apple so chooses to shut them down i discovered this doing a forensic examination of an iphone 3g it appears to be tucked away in a configuration file deep inside corelocation
2857782 i dont think its worth me getting what i would call premature stress over something that may not occur
2857783 but that doesnt mean im not going to give it serious thought in the meantime
2857784 why dont you get out of the car so you can suck my cock like your uncle used to
2857785 the first time i saw it i loved the music but it seemed an oratorio
2857786 i saw how people reacted and thought if messiaen cant do it neither can i but with peters production in salzburg it was the same music but a fantastic opera
2857787 i had just finished adriana and couldnt imagine two stage works one after another or even how la passion could be one but peter liked the idea of doing it onstage
2857788 she was important to me for a long time peter knew her work too
2857789 it is so important for composers to have their own personal harmonic language it is like a smell something immediate that is sensed before anything else
2857790 some colleagues clarify ideas by speaking about their music but i dont talk about it much even to family
2857791 every piece has its history this one is about how we think of persons who have died and arent with us anymore its emotional character comes from painful yet beautiful memories
2857792 i didnt realize that it was anything special i wanted to be a composer but thought that i didnt have enough talent woman composers hardly existed when i started at some point when i was around 20 i decided being a composer is the only thing for me i wanted desperately to write but had no technique at all
2857793 discover the tools by analyzing music and doing technical exercises composition can be taught but your personal expression and talent needs to be there
2857794 i became more aware of how sounds behave and this affected my orchestration
2857795 the result was not so spectacular but helped me understand the complexity of a process that cannot be reduced to logical thinking
2857796 it was our university and our only path to the foreign world
2857797 he wrote down all my certification numbers and asked sternly how many boyfriends i had didnt i know that behaving like i did before marriage was immoral he filled me in on what my neighbours had been saying about how id been bringing a foreign man to my residence he ordered me to move out of my place immediately the very next day if i didnt the state could not be held responsible for anything that might happen to me
2857798 why else would a young woman rent a room alone its not standard in china and in china anyone who does something not standard is immediately suspicious
2857799 and eh dont be angry but let me tell you women cant write
2857800 hot coffee is like a warm blooded man they both give you courage to face a new day
2857801 in most forms of art the artist creates a work and people view it
2857802 in origami you create a work for other people to reproduce it in that way it is a little more like creating music an original designer can create a design and then somebody else can take it and make something better
2857803 getting the most out of the least or starting with a simple piece of flat paper and getting mind blowing results
2857804 when you follow someone elses folds it is like going over their brain with your finger
2857805 because a play is commercial in nature one has to be careful in terms of folding someone elses work and submitting it
2857806 people have remarked that until the field is recognized by the art world and there is actual money to be made the debate will continue
2857807 action abstraction pollock de kooning and american art 1940 1976
2857808 adjusting and constantly evolving expanding and trying to stay as young as i can
2857809 could use a little more substance like we had in the day
2857810 theyre standing on our shoulders some of them dont realize it because they sample me so much
2857811 i started to walk out i thought it was a disney thing i had never heard of this thing
2857812 toward the opening i started having trepidations oh my god what have i done ive ruined my career but when it aired the ratings went through the roof
2857813 i went back on speaking engagements and encouraged african americans to go to africa to interact socially culturally and or economically
2857814 getting into the heads of these characters was kind of an ordeal the actions of the comedian are brutal sometimes
2857815 this is stuff thats a little different than anything i have ever done and it was stuff that i had a hard time with
2857816 yeah yeah its there its tough thats a tough thing i think that scene and the other scene were two things that ill forever remember as an actor
2857817 now war is over mr eddie now i must talk with you
2857818 well thats unfortunate because thats just what im gonna do
2857819 yeah yeah were staying very true to this whole thing and yeah thats there
2857820 it had to be its a big time defining moment for my character it had to be there its the history of the scar the whole deal you cant take that away man
2857821 i dont know how i prepared for that i wasnt prepared for it as much homework as i had done and as many times as i read this book i dont think i was prepared to put a gun to a pregnant womans head and blow her head off
2857822 some situations take courageous decisions with regard to the political future
2857823 and return the risk of nuclear war from the museum of old fears to a prominent place our daily mental furniture
2857824 on general principles when we are looking for a solution of a social problem we must expect to reach conclusions quite oppo
2857825 the scientists she does mention are mostly either well known cranks or are unqualified to comment on climate science
2857826 a nuclear arsenal will allow iran to become a middle east hegemon like the great persia of antiquity yet it will also e
2857827 what i dont understand is why guys like robert kaplan want iran to become more democratic
2857828 the hugely expensive antidrug campaigns we are waging around the world are basically futile
2857829 even as i write these words it is virtually certain that somewhere on the streets of washington d c an eighteen year old white kid from the maryland or north virginia suburbs is buying a stash of drugs from an eighteen year old black kid the white kid is going to take that stash back to the suburbs and make some quick money by selling it to other kids
2857830 look back on his drug use just as recreational and joke
2857831 will enter a hell from which he may never recover
2857832 prison life will change the black kid harden him mess up his mind and redefine his self image and after he is released from prison the black kid will be dragging an invisible ball and chain behind him for the rest of his life by the time the white kid reaches fifty years of age he may well be a judge by the time the black kid reaches fifty he will likely be permanently unemployable will be ineligible for many government assistance programmes and will not even be able to vote
2857833 eu te ligo pra gente conversar melhor pra vc desabafar e tals
2857834 the pleasant loamy smell of rain on the ground especially after a long dry spell
2857835 the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
2857836 want americans to move to the urban core live in tenements take light rail to their government jobs
2857837 enough already we get it its time to move on oil is so 20th century and were tired of fighting wars and killing and maiming hundreds of thousands of people to obtain it
2857838 drilling is the wrong answer it will do nothing right now it is literally a shell game or an exxon mobile game its designed to serve the political interests of vulnerable republicans and the financial interests of profit rich oil companies average americans will not see a dime
2857839 the oil companies say drill and the president and the vice president say how deep i dont think thats the smartest most effective answer
2857840 congressional authority to buy unlimited stakes in and lend to fannie mae and freddie mac
2857841 they assume that their obedience to a stricter and tighter standard will somehow help them raise safer and better children it wont since how children turn out is far more contingent on what is going on inside them than outside them unnecessarily tight boundaries undermine the desire of the holy spirit who is working to build a sense of moral resolve in their hearts
2857842 their children may leave these homes feeling loved but they will also feel something else kids with judgmental parents tend to leave home with a feeling of spiritual elitism kids with legalistic parents leave home feeling guilty they often want nothing to do with the method their parents used to raise them and they usually live their lives in stark contrast to the values they were raised with
2857843 grace based parents spend their times entrusting themselves to christ
2857844 grace based parents have a keen awareness of their feet of clay they understand their own propensity toward sin this makes the grace and forgiveness they received from christ much more appreciated im urging you to raise your children the way god raises his the primary word that defines how god deals with his children is grace grace does not exclude obedience respect boundaries or discipline but it does determine the climate in which these important parts of parenting are carried out
2857845 his grace is there for you when you fail when you fall and when you make huge mistakes this kind of grace makes all the difference in the world when its coming from god through you to your children children brought up in homes where they are free to be different vulnerable candid and to make mistakes learn firsthand what the genuine love of god looks like
2857846 god is a god of variety and he deals with us accordingly
2857847 satan is working even as you are reading this book to meet your childs three driving inner needs in counterfeit ways every time you see him making a move on your children hes offering them a knockoff solution to one or a combination of these three inner needs
2857848 if weve done our job adequately our children should leave our homes with a love that is secure a purpose that is significant and a hope that is strong grace is not so much what we do as parents but how we do what we do
2857849 im a simple cheerful and friendly woman with great passion in writing
2857850 you have set sail on another ocean without star or compass going where the argument leads shattering the certainties of centuries
2857851 in metaphysical terms the albedo is that which occupies the space between things
2857852 i prefer not to think of it as fate no fate would be so cruel my little boy did not deserve to come out into the world with such a harsh beginning
2857853 if its too emotional to watch you dont have to
2857854 people tell me that it can be done that parents have been reunited with their child in twenty years
2857855 but he wont remember us maybe if were lucky hell remember our names but he wont remember us i dont even know if hes alive they say you can always have another child thats ridiculous to suggest i could have 10 or 20 more children but it would never erase the pain of having lost him children are irreplaceable
2857856 the best moments in reading are when you come across something a thought a feeling a way of looking at things which you had thought special and particular to you and now here it is set down by someone else a person you have never met someone even who is long dead and it is as if a hand has come out and taken yours
2857857 a road to a world with no borders no boundaries no flags no countries where the heart is the only passport you carry
2857858 something to read maybe a wild onion in the gutted road
2857859 ice sculpting is a very popular activity on a p amp o cruise and it is not something people usually try so it made sense to give them the opportunity in the virtual world
2857860 it is great fun interactive and a very popular competition from the great response we have had so far
2857861 the standard of sculptures is really outstanding and there is still time to get involved
2857862 gaudi achieved only mediocre grades but did well in his trial drawings and projects
2857863 who knows if we have given this diploma to a nut or to a genius time will tell
2857864 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
2857865 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
2857866 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
2857867 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
2857868 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
2857869 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
2857870 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
2857871 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
2857872 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
2857873 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
2857874 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2857875 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2857876 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2857877 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2857878 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2857879 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2857880 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2857881 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2857882 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2857883 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2857884 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2857885 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2857886 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2857887 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2857888 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2857889 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2857890 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2857891 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2857892 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2857893 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2857894 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2857895 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2857896 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2857897 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2857898 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2857899 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2857900 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2857901 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2857902 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2857903 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
2857904 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
2857905 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2857906 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2857907 as i look around now a lot of us especially in the newer foundations are in a big hurry to achieve social change we want to reduce inequity and we want it now we want measurable outcomes we want replicability and we want scale some of this impatience to improve things quickly comes from the corporate ethos where performance measurement is embedded in the culture much of the new talent in the foundations and in the new citizen sector organisations comes from business for the answer to emerge we will need patience compassion and reflection
2857908 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2857909 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2857910 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2857911 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2857912 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2857913 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2857914 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2857915 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2857916 the jonah factor 13 spiritual steps to finding the job of a lifetime
2857917 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2857918 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2857919 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2857920 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2857921 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2857922 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2857923 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2857924 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2857925 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2857926 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2857927 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2857928 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2857929 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2857930 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2857931 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2857932 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2857933 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2857934 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2857935 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2857936 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2857937 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2857938 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2857939 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2857940 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2857941 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2857942 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2857943 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2857944 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2857945 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2857946 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2857947 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2857948 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2857949 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
2857950 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2857951 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2857952 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2857953 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2857954 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2857955 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2857956 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2857957 just so you all know we did set a record
2857958 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2857959 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2857960 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2857961 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2857962 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2857963 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2857964 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2857965 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2857966 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2857967 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2857968 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2857969 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2857970 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2857971 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2857972 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2857973 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2857974 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2857975 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2857976 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2857977 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2857978 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2857979 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2857980 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2857981 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2857982 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2857983 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2857984 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2857985 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2857986 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2857987 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2857988 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2857989 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2857990 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2857991 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2857992 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2857993 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2857994 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2857995 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2857996 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2857997 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2857998 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2857999 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2858000 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2858001 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2858002 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2858003 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2858004 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2858005 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2858006 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2858007 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2858008 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2858009 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2858010 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2858011 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2858012 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2858013 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2858014 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2858015 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2858016 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2858017 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2858018 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2858019 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2858020 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2858021 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2858022 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2858023 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2858024 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2858025 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2858026 with cloud computer looming on the horizon it is important for us all to think of the privacy threats there as well
2858027 the tool resides with someone else and the data is stored somewhere else generally that is a bad idea
2858028 when information is in the public domain it is game over
2858029 information on your computer may get protection under the law but on someone elses it gets less protection
2858030 the information we are all giving to online companies is massive and dangerous and its going to get worse before it gets better
2858031 giving them our data is a clear and present risk
2858032 how hard would it be to target someone as a political activist or a person with aids
2858033 just this past week we passed out of the u s senate banking committee which is my committee a bill to call for divestment from iran as a way of ratcheting up the pressure to ensure that they dont obtain a nuclear weapon
2858034 you live under this roof you live by my rules
2858035 kegagalan adalah jalan menuju kemenangan tiada kata putus asa terlintas di dalam jiwa
2858036 petit con tu crois que tu fous quoi l mais euh matt c tait pour rire je comptais pas vraiment d voiler la fin de ton roman en ligne cest a ouais demandons ton genoux ce quil en pense aaaaah mais l che cette batte bordel
2858037 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
2858038 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2858039 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2858040 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2858041 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2858042 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2858043 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2858044 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2858045 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2858046 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2858047 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2858048 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2858049 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2858050 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2858051 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2858052 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2858053 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2858054 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2858055 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2858056 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2858057 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2858058 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2858059 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2858060 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2858061 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2858062 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2858063 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2858064 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2858065 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2858066 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2858067 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2858068 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2858069 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2858070 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2858071 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2858072 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2858073 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2858074 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2858075 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2858076 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2858077 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2858078 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2858079 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2858080 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2858081 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2858082 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2858083 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2858084 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2858085 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2858086 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2858087 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2858088 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2858089 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2858090 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2858091 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2858092 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
2858093 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
2858094 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
2858095 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2858096 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2858097 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2858098 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2858099 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2858100 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2858101 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2858102 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2858103 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2858104 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2858105 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2858106 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2858107 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2858108 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2858109 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2858110 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2858111 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2858112 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2858113 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2858114 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2858115 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2858116 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2858117 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2858118 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2858119 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2858120 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2858121 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2858122 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2858123 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2858124 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2858125 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2858126 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2858127 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2858128 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2858129 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2858130 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2858131 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2858132 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2858133 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2858134 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2858135 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2858136 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2858137 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2858138 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2858139 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2858140 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2858141 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2858142 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2858143 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2858144 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2858145 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2858146 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2858147 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2858148 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2858149 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2858150 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2858151 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2858152 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2858153 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2858154 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2858155 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2858156 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
2858157 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
2858158 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2858159 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
2858160 hi im barack obama of course you know that maybe john mccains right and i am the biggest celebrity in the world but that doesnt mean i dont have a plan for a better america john mccain wants to stick to outdated technologies like coal nuclear power and offshore drilling which would continue to harm our environment and keep us stuck in the 20th century my plan emphasizes renewable resources existing effective technology like wind and solar power and will have us completely independent from foreign oil by the year 2018 hmmmm maybe they like me for a reason
2858161 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2858162 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2858163 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2858164 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2858165 after 5 years eight hotels management is delighted to launch the newly redesigned kirketon hotel our brief to designer connie alessi was to create soft furnishing luxury finish comfort and practicality while creating individual touches of sydney cool

2858205 he was part of the initial regulation and encouragement to grow the american merchant fleet
2858206 we know that because all of our students are required to memorize a saying that he has which goes you can have a first class merchant marine with first class men even if they sail second class ships but second class men cant be trusted on the finest ships afloat
2858207 what he was saying was it was important to invest in the education and in the training of merchant mariners of the officers who go to sea
2858208 so for all those good reasons the academy was overjoyed at the opportunity to honor the kennedy family by naming the training ship after the kennedys
2858209 we have 1 200 young men and women in training going through college this will be a daily constant reminder of both the public service that the kennedys are famous for and also their love of the sea

2858226 theyre happening to homes on corner lots or homes that are adjacent to open space we think that thats so burglars can get in and out easily
2858227 certainly we would like to believe that we live in a community where you can leave your doors and windows unlocked and in summer months people are more inclined to do that but the reality is burglars are gonna hit where their opportunity presents itself

2858312 over 1 000 civilians have been killed as the result of an attack by georgia on the capital of its breakaway republic of south ossetia the north ossetian nationalities minister said friday according to the south ossetian information and press committee the number of fatalities is estimated according to preliminary information at over 1 000

2858316 there were blacks among the dead who were probably either mercenaries or instructors in the georgian armed forces
2858317 there are lots of bodies over there a lot of people have been killed mostly ossetians but also georgians they had american emblems on their forearms and they were in black uniforms

2858324 i have observed that in all other countries including in america people are complaining about how prices of gasoline are going up
2858325 the cure is not to reduce the price but on the contrary to raise it even higher to break our addiction to oil we are going to introduce a new tax reform in the direction of even higher taxation on energy and the revenue generated on that will be used to cut taxes on personal income so we will improve incentives to work and improve incentives to save energy and develop renewable energy

2858338 brims on pre eighteenth century hats were not always flat
2858339 but in those times only one side of the brim was cocked up later on in the eighteenth century the fashion was for three cocked sides so the brim had to be flat so that it could be cocked up neatly
2858340 some of this is a matter of style and some function fashion gives you a great deal of leeway
2858341 i have to refine it because as it is itll never look right or fit right
2858342 i need to stretch it out where it needs to be and refine and cut down the brim where its too big
2858343 i love to make things with my hands and its fun to work with people they give me a challenge
2858344 i might be just as happy making shoes as hats
2858345 i just want to be independent and fulfilled by my work
2858346 i have no kitchen and the bathroom is down the hall but otherwise my apartment is really cool
2858347 im always on the lookout for them at yard sales these are what i use to hold together my signs making them as authentic as possible
2858348 if a board already has good surface i keep it
2858349 but much of the time i have to manipulate the surface so that its appropriate for the effect i need
2858350 i hope that when my customer sees that crusty old paint they will have the same feeling
2858351 were re creating their ancestry for them but all the same its for the sake of aesthetics
2858352 this is a simple sign thats meant to quietly describe only a business name
2858353 which leads me to say i consider myself to be a folk artist and not really a sign painter
2858354 my art simply takes the shape of trade and tavern signs its a combination of my art background my love of painted antiques and an urge to create using my hands
2858355 its like i put it all into a blender and something i really like emerges
2858356 combien de temps h siterez vous entre les deux c t s si hachem est d ieu suivez le et si cest baal suivez le

2858358 before you come into the house you have to take off your shoes
2858359 also there is no smoking if you want to smoke go into the garage
2858360 oh ida red ida red dont you do this again
2858361 when youre addicted to drugs you just have to accept the fact that its never going to change
2858362 i know when i go back to palm springs my disease will be waiting for me thats why i always keep three bottles of valium under my mattress
2858363 today is a very important day in your treatment lethe
2858364 your specific medical history requires a great deal of attention
2858365 you must do this program there is no choice in the matter
2858366 unless you agree to the treatment plan we have outlined here im afraid well be forced to give you an unsuccessful discharge
2858367 i was planning to go to the west coast but now im going to be stuck here in tucson
2858368 do i look like a pusherman to you not every black person sells drugs
2858369 the patient says he is cultivating himself to become a genius
2858370 the patient says he has to return to college where he can resume his work in solitude
2858371 but i thought you were studying to become a genius
2858372 but the police found fourteen separate plastic baggies of heroin in your mothers apartment
2858373 but you agree that heroin wasnt going to help you study
2858374 my girlfriend told me about what happened in the massage studio
2858375 i realized that i couldnt take care of my wife anymore
2858376 do you know anything about the theory of adolescence salem
2858377 other than that my children are in their adolescence i know what they go through i think
2858378 and what can you tell me about what theyre going through
2858379 im talking about an unconscious teenage rebellion against your wife mother
2858380 because ive stayed with rose for almost twenty five years
2858381 exactly my point about the theory of adolescence you still havent broken away from your dependence on your mother wife if you had developed your adolescent independence then you wouldve divorced your wife a long time ago you would have broken off the marriage when you first realized things werent working out but instead you stayed in a dependency because it mirrored your dependency on your mother
2858382 you have to admit freud changed our view of human relationships
2858383 salem if you want you can walk out the door right now i wont charge you a dime all im telling you is that you havent been loyal to your wife and you havent been faithful to her because of your dependency you may think you have but you havent youve been lying to her for nearly two decades if you truly cared about your wife then you wouldve gotten out of this marriage a long time ago
2858384 ive wanted to say this to you for the last ten years but then we had children and after the children you became sick
2858385 this has been the hardest decision in my life rose i cant live with you anymore i need to be honest with myself and that means being honest with you its not fair to either one of us anymore i dont know what youre thinking right now all i know is that this has been extremely hard for me maybe if i still loved you rose it would be easier for me to take care of you but im not at peace with myself in this marriage and my feelings arent there anymore its like im an actor putting on show for everyone else i cant imagine what this must be like for you youre probably going to hate me for awhile please rose forgive me ive given this decision a lot of thought ive been talking to a psychologist
2858386 isnt it a little premature to say anything to them
2858387 but is it necessary to tell them right this minute
2858388 before the doctors diagnosed me i told you i was sick i told you i couldnt keep up with you on vacations i needed to rest all the time and you blamed me as if it were my fault
2858389 you dont have to tell me this honey doesnt that mean anything to you
2858390 she has multiple system atrophy it may be getting worse this has never happened before
2858391 this better be good i took three days off of work to come here
2858392 i work at lutheran general i think ive seen you before im a pediatrician my name is gabriela
2858393 during the wisdom seminar i told you about the importance of the body we must care for the body this is true the body is sacred today i am going to talk about how the physical and spiritual are one when you take care of the physical you take care of spiritual if you nourish the body you nourish the soul meditation is how we nourish the soul we call it body breath because it unites today i want you to notice how the breath is the doorway to the three dimensions of body mind and spirit
2858394 no no maybe youre right after all we had the children together and rose with her illness you know it wasnt her fault i just didnt love her i couldnt
2858395 no not really she wanted to be an artist she wanted to go to school i never said anything
2858396 and when you asked for a divorce what did you say
2858397 i told her i was unhappy i said that if had i loved her then maybe things would have been different
2858398 mourir pour ce quon aime cest un trop doux effort
2858399 french it means to die for one you love is too sweet an effort
2858400 i couldnt die for her because i didnt love her
2858401 ill be home in a couple days when i get home i promise to speak to him about this
2858402 my wife called to tell me that my sons taking drugs
2858403 ex wife and if your sons on drugs theres nothing you can do about it you need to protect yourself and not let your family walk all over you like this
2858404 do i look like a pusherman to you not every black person sells drugs
2858405 shes not buying me drugs okay shes doing me a favor
2858406 the police came to the apartment they found heroin all over
2858407 the patient says he is cultivating himself to become a genius
2858408 the patient says he has to return to college where he can resume his work in solitude
2858409 but the police found heroin all over your mothers apartment correct
2858410 but i thought you were studying to become a genius
2858411 but the police found fourteen separate plastic baggies of heroin in your mothers apartment that sounds like a little more than an experiment to me
2858412 but you agree that heroin wasnt going to help you study
2858413 oh ida red ida red dont you do this again
2858414 have you ever seen nypd blue i wrote the first season
2858415 no just a television writer hollywood is filled with them
2858416 you kidding me i did tons of drugs but it was different back then everybody did drugs in the 70s and 80s
2858417 when youre addicted to drugs you just have to accept the fact that its never going to change youll always be an addict thats what they say right they say no matter how much clean time you have youll never be cured i believe that man i really believe it
2858418 i know when i go back to palm springs my disease will be waiting for me thats why i always keep three bottles of valium under my mattress
2858419 today is a very important day in your treatment lethe
2858420 let me ask you a question lethe have you thought about your plans after treatment
2858421 im not sure lethe now your parents arrived here less than an hour ago and i have been talking to them about this program this is an outstanding program for young people
2858422 your specific medical history requires a great deal of attention twenty eight days is not enough to make a difference in your life habits over the course of your stay here we have diagnosed you with a number of other disorders including manic depression infantile grandiosity syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder camp wo tuck a batche has an outstanding reputation in helping adolescents deal with these issues we feel that you would really thrive in an environment like this and it would only be six or eight months before you could go home
2858423 you must do this program there is no choice in the matter
2858424 im not doing it youre not sending me to that place i already told you im going to the west coast
2858425 im afraid lethe if that is your final decision we are going to have to ask you to leave creosote
2858426 unless you agree to the treatment plan we have outlined here im afraid well be forced to give you an unsuccessful discharge
2858427 i was planning to go to the west coast but now im going to be stuck here in tucson
2858428 it doesnt matter now im taking you to san jose
2858429 your father wants me to drop you off at a halfway house
2858430 before you come into the house you have to take off your shoes
2858431 also there is no smoking if you want to smoke go into the garage
2858432 everyone hates me here one of them says i stole his sugar
2858433 i thought it was communal sugar how was i supposed to know
2858434 we cant do this i forgot scar face is a stoner
2858435 why not leave the room go to the park a short walk down our street the fresh air is good
2858436 its in the papers you signed i can show you
2858437 you can have some of my coffee if you want the sugars on the counter
2858438 i forgot to tell you something last night im the one whos responsible for getting you kicked out
2858439 i dont understand why are you giving me a grateful dead bootleg
2858440 my wages from the last two weeks i told you not to open it
2858441 i have an inheritance coming from my grandmother when she dies plus the church says were not supposed to have too much money
2858442 not a bad place to be if you have loose morals
2858443 its time for you to go to bed now mazzy

2858446 but were eating as a family and you look like youre in vaudeville

2858449 how to choose a shopping cart system that will make you the most money
2858450 for some time now the hands and feet of the body of christ have been amputated and weve been pretty much reduced to a big mouth
2858451 this woman was caught in the act of adultery 5 the law of moses says to stone her what do you say
2858452 all right but let the one who has never sinned throw the first stone
2858453 where are your accusers didnt even one of them condemn you
2858454 last week an application turned the iphone into a megaphone to proclaim
2858455 i found that some users complain about prices for iphone applications above 99 cents
2858456 without these important textile furnishings historic rooms are really incomplete
2858457 you cant use original pieces except for limited periods of time with controlled lighting so you need to make recreations if the room is to be open to the public
2858458 i didnt want to copy something that somebody had made previously
2858459 thats only appropriate if a period document from the house exists when you have been exposed to a period the paintings furnishings textiles probate records and diaries a professional can put it together and come up with a design but it takes decades of study in the field to do this successfully
2858460 when you read about the quantity of fabrics that were consumed in period its simply staggering
2858461 and where are they it becomes a philosophical discussion about survival and how you deal with these rare pieces
2858462 in this period copper plate prints and dimity white on white cotton were very much in fashion
2858463 stripes were also very exciting for this time period and my head said stripes for this bed
2858464 most people would probably go with cotton in this period
2858465 but i decided to use wool which was all pervasive in that society
2858466 i wanted something that would look good and yet have the neo classic aesthetic but it has to fit the room without competing with this dramatic wall covering
2858467 notice that ive used passementerie as a decorative element as well as a hand embroidered ribbon in a greek key design on watered silk
2858468 i also used gold colored linen to cover the tester and to line the valences
2858469 by far the most difficult part was the linen tester because of the curve of the tester and the irregular shape
2858470 one interesting thing about this project is that i learned that you create camaraderie while sewing
2858471 you can easily understand why people got together to sew in the past
2858472 if you dont like to sew its hard work he said

2858474 if a foreign tourist wears a polo and no sees him does he exist
2858475 if i met him today would i be interested in him knowing what i do about him
2858476 this type of case was the height of fashion when it was made and is very rare today
2858477 we have just refinished the exterior and now im working on the action
2858478 we often have to replace ivories from our stock of more than 200 old piano keys
2858479 we are always careful to match both color and grain
2858480 theres a big difference between repairing a 100 year old northern spruce soundboard and replacing it
2858481 my theory is that you should keep the original soundboard whenever possible
2858482 ive been doing this for 16 years now i just turned 50 last may
2858483 i feel lucky to get up and work on pianos and make other people happy i dont consider it work and im very fortunate to be doing what i like to do
2858484 and with a heavy slow hand i jotted this down
2858485 a dozen times scrawling through time and space to make my point
2858486 i told them i am worthless i am a painting they wouldnt stop watching me
2858487 hey you want some more mashed potatoes i could whip up some more for you
2858488 i cant remember who was hosting it but i really enjoyed him he was fair and asked good questions

2858492 i am not an orphan but this gangrene in my leg pushed me to this situation i was forced to leave my house and in utter frustration i wanted to commit suicide but the sai devotees helped me and instilled confidence in me to live up to this day
2858493 should i go back to work for the money even though i dont need it
2858494 should i go back to work even a little bit to save the sliver of sanity i have left
2858495 oh god you are the one indicated by the sacred sound om
2858496 many people have indicated how important the islands heritage is to them and how they would like to see it managed we want to be sure everyone has the opportunity to give us their input
2858497 i have always believed that music can change peoples lives and if i can do something to make someones life a little more enjoyable then i feel i have done my job well thats why i am here and that is also the reason why there is southern rock
2858498 as a former member of the original lynyrd skynyrd band it is always a pleasure to get to sing with a van zant jimmie van zant is a talented singer and songwriter and has been a good friend to me as well i wish him the very best in carrying on the family tradition of great southern music love you jimmie

2858750 the suskind account states that two senior cia officers robert richer and john maguire supervised the preparation of the document under direct orders coming from director george tenet not so says my source
2858751 former cia director george tenet is for once telling the truth when he states that he would not have undermined himself by preparing such a document while at the same time insisting publicly that there was no connection between saddam and al qaeda richer and maguire have both denied that they were involved with the forgery and it should also be noted that preparation of such a document to mislead the media is illegal and they could have wound up in jail
2858752 who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
2858753 the pentagon has its own false documents center primarily used to produce fake papers for delta force and other special ops officers traveling under cover as businessmen

2858776 through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear
2858777 by his gods son he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power
2858778 thus by power by the word all things were made and all things are upheld
2858779 thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his works which he had made and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made
2858780 the heaven and the earth which are now are kept in store

2858800 motorcycle helmets protect motorcyclists who crash from sustaining head injury and the results also suggest that motorcycle helmets protect motorcyclists who crash from death
2858801 the findings are important to consider in those countries with without mandatory motorcycle helmet laws as well as in jurisdictions with weak or partial helmet legislation
2858802 confirms the belief of specialists in emergency medicine and should put an end to any further debate about the protective role of helmets regarding head injury in motorcycle riders
2858803 the debate over mandating use in adults should center on personal freedom to accept a known risk
2858804 the review supports the view that helmet use should be actively encouraged worldwide for rider safety
2858805 the personal freedom issue must be balanced with the cost to society of the care of patients with catastrophic head injury riders cite the pleasure of going helmet less but often the cost of care for the injured motorcyclist is passed on to society at large
2858806 may not fully understand the scientifically demonstrated level of risk involved in riding without a helmet and might assume the risks are acceptable if the law does not prohibit it in that context the american academy of emergency medicine believes that states should require helmet use in all age groups
2858807 while recently privatized roads do not have enough history to determine how high actual rates will rise adequate data do exist to determine what happens when toll rates increase dramatically on state run toll roads
2858808 the ohio turnpike substantially increased tolls during the 1990s to help finance construction of a third lane in each direction over substantial portions of the turnpike
2858809 because the ohio turnpike raised its rates for trucks in the 1990s and later lowered them again sufficient data exist to calculate a demand curve for the turnpike based on demand and the toll rate we then use the resulting demand curve to estimate diversion of trucks caused by the changes in the toll rates and to forecast how toll rates might affect turnpike truck revenue
2858810 the combination of inadequate maintenance lack of capital for new capacity and ever growing demand has led to renewed calls for tolls
2858811 it is curious that national policy clearly supports sales or long term leases of roads to private parties when such negative results can be expected
2858812 it does not appear that the u s department of transportation has considered how far tolling and highway privatization should go how such a market based system of interstate highways will affect the parallel system of publicly owned state and local roads or the effect of private tolling on interstate commerce unless u s dot is already committed to the toll based funding for all roads
2858813 if the true problem is that political leaders are unwilling to face the voters with the reality that there is no free lunch then the problem we seek to solve by tolling and privatization will not solve the problem at all in fact our research suggests that it will only make the problem worse
2858814 if we want to immerse our neighbors in the lavish splendor of god then we must understand them more deeply than we often do

2858829 we saw a clear tipping point between ages 12 and 14 where child passengers became much more likely to die in a crash than their younger counterparts
2858830 long before these children ever receive a learners permit they begin to exhibit a pattern that looks more like the high fatality rates we see for teen drivers
2858831 riding with drivers younger than 16 years old not wearing seat belts and riding on higher speed roads are the three biggest factors contributing to an older child being killed in a crash
2858832 knowing the risks can help parents and teens make smart decisions about which rides are safe and which ones are off limits
2858833 we should not accept teen crash deaths as random accidents
2858834 these deaths are preventable our hope is that teens parents and policy makers will work together to develop a culture of safe smart passengers by providing guidance and reinforcing safe behaviors throughout the teen years

2858902 but the notion that somehow mccain is going to get in there and be some kind of ideological newt gingrich right winger is a joke theres no way that he would do that
2858903 i think the guy calls em as he sees em and as president would call em as he sees em and would make people mad all over the place because it wouldnt fit anybodys playbook
2858904 hes a very good legislator from my point of view because when he gets onto something he doesnt just want to introduce a bill he likes to move it and hes fearless
2858905 people couldnt believe how long we stayed on mccain feingold wed come to those press conferences year after year and you guys would laugh at us i mean literally
2858906 hes a great guy to fight an uphill battle with legislatively he keeps his word i probably shouldnt be saying this stuff but to be honest about it it was one of the better professional experiences ive ever had in my life
2858907 its unfair because mccains a blast hes fun to be around hes certainly young in spirit hes actually very young in energy
2858908 yes he shows temper but he burns fast and he doesnt let it cloud his judgment he would not be a loose cannon in the oval office
2858909 its not like hes going to pick up the red phone in a rage
2858910 just in my mind i always felt like i had what it took to get here

2858918 have you looked in your melbourne international film festival program and found it full of misery dreariness self abuse drug abuse child abuse immigrant abuse and new romanian cinema i certainly have and found it far too grim for my tastes ive come to the conclusion that what i really need this winter is a bit more cheer and fun and if youre going anywhere near miff you probably do too hence im pleased to announce the first and very possibly the last anti miff film festival there wont be queues of shivering patrons in hand knitted beanies there wont be large simon callow look alikes holding forth loudly on the rebirth of hungarian melodrama there wont be the lingering musky smell of the forum filled with gold pass holders who havent been near a bath in two weeks however there will be films that way too much fun to be allowed near the program of this years miff

2858976 many of us are searching without knowing exactly what we are looking for some of us go on a diet to lose weight and try all kinds of programs and workshops to make ourselves feel better or perhaps we throw ourselves into our work and seek wealth and status to fill the void but underneath an emotional emptiness remains no matter how much we try to gloss over that yearning with temporary fixes it is still there whispering the truth that what we need isnt another quick fix but rather a rebirth a whole life revolution

2858981 you dont have to overhaul your entire diet all at once this is using the brute force of your will willpower does not work if you start to make the changes in smaller chunks at whatever pace feels intuitively right for you you will rediscover a sense of rightful balance one thing that will help support making these changes is your daily yoga practice your mat becomes a mirror and as you step onto it every morning you will be able to start seeing the direct effects of your diet

2859246 going into any game i always believe i can score
2859247 over the two legs i could have got one or two goals
2859248 even on their day i dont think theyre any better than a team finishing fourth or fifth in scotland
2859249 last season seems so far away even in pre season we just havent been at it
2859250 you need players that can create and i dont think we have that
2859251 im not saying our players are bad their strengths are in the other side of the game
2859252 guys like barry ferguson and steve davis can do that
2859253 because of the work permits situation theres a huge difference between who we can sign and who others can get
2859254 eindhoven can sign romario and ronaldo as kids we cant
2859255 the market is smaller for us than the likes of eindhoven porto belgian clubs french clubs thats why were sometimes forced to go and pay money elsewhere
2859256 we have a list of players from ecuador honduras you name it but we cant get them in
2859257 thats why there are constraints on us and its about time people learned there are constraints on us
2859258 i dont think weve got the money to buy walk into the team type of players
2859259 even if i paid that for andy johnson is he better that scott mcdonald or jan vennegoor of hesselink
2859260 most of our deals have to be gambling deals massimo donati 1 1m barry robson the same paul hartley the same its all those kind of deals at the moment

2859266 kami akan berlari secepatnya ke jembatan dan menyeberangi sungai walaupun agak lama karena jarak yang cukup jauh tetapi lari dan menyeberang melalui jembatan adalah yang paling aman
2859267 bagus sekali jawaban kalian yang menjawab melompat ke seberang berarti kalian mempunyai semangat berani mencoba yang menjawab turun ke air berarti kalian mengutamakan praktek yang memakai tongkat berarti kalian pintar memakai unsur dari luar untuk sampai ke tujuan sedangkan yang berlari ke jembatan untuk menyeberang berarti kalian lebih mengutamakan keamanan bapak senang kalian memiliki alasan atas jawaban itu semua jalan yang kalian tempuh adalah positif dan baik selama kalian tahu tujuan yang hendak dicapai asalkan kalian mau berusaha dengan keras tahu target yang hendak dicapai tidak akan lari gunung di kejar pasti tujuan kalian akan tercapai pesan bapak mulai dari sekarang dan sampai kapanpun kalian harus lebih rajin belajar dan berusaha menghadapi setiap masalah yang muncul agar berhasil sampai ke tempat tujuan

2859271 quite some time 17 games its been a long time
2859272 it was nice to eventually make it happen and i think the way we did it was also very pleasing
2859273 coming here against a good aberdeen side theyre always going to have a lot of possession a lot of the ball and i thought we coped well
2859274 we played some decent stuff at times i thought our opening goal was superb
2859275 a really big thing for me today and something that epitomised everything was the ball that jamie smith played into the box in the first half that fizzed in and grant munro made a fantastic clearance header
2859276 he took the ball and lee miller out of play and i thought that really summed up our day the way the spirit was in working for each other it really was first class
2859277 i mean the first 20 minutes we were all over them and we just couldnt get the break
2859278 there was plenty of good football a lot of pace to it good passing and creating chances but not out and out chances although we were having a lot of possession and stupidly we lose the ball in a dangerous position and they inverness get a goal and take a massive lift from that
2859279 then were on a bit of a downer and in the second half we just never produced
2859280 they were very well oragnised and all credit to the inverness defence because when we got crosses in and got to the goal line they defended very well
2859281 we never got any pace to the game in the second half as they got bodies behind the ball and we started to get a bit frustrated and started hitting long balls instead of getting it to the side and getting crosses in from decent areas
2859282 thats exactly right we lost too many of our big players our crossing was poor when we got into good positions and there were too many good players who can bring you to a different level that didnt play well
2859283 it just doesnt go for you sometimes and as i say i was well pleased with them the crowd were up for it and there was a lot of good football
2859284 that left our supporters a bit flat and rightly so and that left us a bit flat then in the second half were fighting against ourselves but i think the credit has got to go to inverness
2859285 it was good to come on first game of the season and get the win it was good to win
2859286 it was one of my first touches its always good to get a strike away and give us the lead
2859287 obviously its good to get a goal but as long as the team is winning it doesnt really make a difference who is scoring goals as long as we get three points at the end of the day
2859288 there was one just before i thought he was going to slide back to me but unfortunately he didnt and then the second time he did and it did eventually end up in the back of the net
2859289 lo the poor indian whose untutored mind sees god in the clouds and hears him in the wind
2859290 adjusting and constantly evolving expanding and trying to stay as young as i can
2859291 could use a little more substance like we had in the day
2859292 theyre standing on our shoulders some of them dont realize it because they sample me so much
2859293 i started to walk out i thought it was a disney thing i had never heard of this thing
2859294 toward the opening i started having trepidations oh my god what have i done ive ruined my career but when it aired the ratings went through the roof
2859295 i miss you stacey i really do you were always awesome to hang with and in a bad mood you always made me feel better something very special about you there miss something i cant quite put my finger on its not the pretty smile not the cute dimples when you smile not your deliciously thick ass not your boobies but your personality your ability to be so happy and to make others happy mainly me truly something to be proud of no matter what when im with you im happy nuff said

2859303 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2859304 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor
2859305 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2859306 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2859307 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2859308 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2859309 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2859310 but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
2859311 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2859312 as for these things which you are looking at the days will come in which there will not be left one stone upon another which will not be torn down
2859313 see to it that you are not misled for many will come in my name saying i am he and the time is near do not go after them
2859314 when you hear of wars and disturbances do not be terrified for these things must take place first but the end does not follow immediately
2859315 but before all these things they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you delivering you to the synagogues and prisons bringing you before kings and governors for my names sake
2859316 so make up your minds not to prepare beforehand to defend yourselves
2859317 but you will be betrayed even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends and they will put some of you to death
2859318 but when you see jerusalem surrounded by armies then recognize that her desolation is near
2859319 then those who are in judea must flee to the mountains and those who are in the midst of the city must leave and those who are in the country must not enter the city
2859320 woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days for there will be great distress upon the land and wrath to this people
2859321 there will be signs in sun and moon and stars and on the earth dismay among nations in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the waves
2859322 then they will see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory
2859323 so you also when you see these things happening recognize that the kingdom of god is near
2859324 truly i say to you this generation will not pass away until all things take place
2859325 heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away
2859326 be on guard so that your hearts will not be weighted down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of life and that day will not come on you suddenly like a trap
2859327 but keep on the alert at all times praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are about to take place and to stand before the son of man
2859328 wouldnt it be great if you got to meet johnny depp

2859331 to a large degree its not an engineering matter its almost a legal question
2859332 this approach has never been used in wallingford to establish parking requirements for any site
2859333 its going to be up to the commission to determine what is reasonable
2859334 unfortunately i believe that american muslims today suffer the same misconceptions and fears that other religions have experienced in the past
2859335 this is a very unusual comment to come from the engineering depart ment
2859336 if there is a parking overflow situation those people that were previously mentioned are going to be parking on our streets and our lawns
2859337 between outreach and me working at home i work at least 35 hours a week

2859358 the fact that deputy tollison took his closed fist and struck the suspect in the face 13 times in my opinion was excessive
2859359 then they have the audacity to treat this man as if hes a piece of meat and taser him with electrical jolts to his body and then thats not enough
2859360 see a counselor or grow up or leave this situation etc it made me think what would be on my dartboard you are judging your insides
2859361 when that happens you should stop right there recognize you are doing it and call your energies back into the present

2859370 today one of the methods that includes racism is separatism the attempt to delimit the lands controlled by the white race by adapting and privatizing the wealth that belongs to the nation and its people we already knew these intentions in the form of the rich districts that sought to be defined as municipalities with the goal that a share of the taxes taken by law from their immense richnesses remains under their control to increase the revenue to their split off districts behind which they sought to insulate and to use a privately controlled security apparatus to guard their privileged life styles the separatist referendum is an oligarchic racist and economic device used because they want to keep the greatest part of the wealth of santa cruz for their own benefit and because the oligarchs want moreover to prevent the government of evo morales from continuing the process of land reform and extending all over the country
2859371 let us speak about autonomy not for the oligarchy but for the people with whom we struggle these separatist groups which have just lost their privileges were for a long time in the palace they controlled the country and allowed the plundering of our country our natural resources including its natural resources and the same with the privatization of our companies and now they once again want to reestablish this system which exposes their true interest economic control

2859511 saya yakin kita sering berpikir mungkin dengan istri kita keluarga kita kalau melihat anak anak bermain main pagi siang sore
2859512 tapi ini pertanyaannya sederhana anak kita ini kita mau didik jadi orang baik atau kita didik jadi orang pintar atau kita didik jadi orang kuat yang mana yang primer kalau ketiga tiganya tidak mungkin juga terkadang konsentrasinya untuk menjadi pintar kebaikannya terabaikan atau kebaikannya sedemikian rupa khusuknya sehingga kekuatannya hilang
2859513 jadi yang paling dihadapi anak anak kita 5 tahun lagi 10 tahun lagi 20 tahun lagi ini apa yang paling dibutuhkan anak anak kita itu mari kita pikirkan bersama kekuatan mental kepandaian akal atau kebaikan hati yang mana yang paling utama dan keputusan mengenai yang mana yang primer yang mana yang tidak primer dari ketiganya tadi sudah sedemikian urgent karena sekarang setiap detik kita berjumpa dengan anak kita
2859514 dan kita harus mengatur strategi pendidikan kita disetiap kalimat yang kita ucapkan disetiap dialektika dan dialog yang kita lakukan dengan anak anak kita sudah harus ada ketentuan dari konsep kita bahwa yang kita utamakan adalah misalnya anak kita harus kuat atau anak kita harus baik ataukah anak kita harus pintar mana mudhorot mana manfaat dari ketiga tiganya itu pada masing masing atau keseluruhan
2859515 tapi ini pertanyaannya sederhana anak kita ini kita mau didik jadi orang baik atau kita didik jadi orang pintar atau kita didik jadi orang kuat yang mana yang primer kalau ketiga tiganya tidak mungkin juga

2859575 if a girl can do it a guy can too you can do anything you want to do
2859576 and being in an agony he prayed the longer and his sweat became as drops of blood trickling down upon the ground
2859577 as the flogging continue the lacerations would tear into the underlying skeletal muscles and produce quivering ribbons of bleeding flesh
2859578 the sufferers veins were laid bare and the very muscles sinews and bowels of the victim were open to exposure
2859579 so with one lash one swing of the whip a total of nine lacerations could be inflicted on the victim each laceration two inches long and three quarters to one inch deep the idea of the lead weight was to lift the skeletal muscle out imagine having a cut on your skin with an inch of muscle pulled out through the cut exposed to the night air we see this sometimes in stab wounds or when people are stabbed with sharp objects like sticks and the muscles are pulled back through the skin the purpose this served in the scourging was that as the victim hung on the cross in the heat of the day birds could alight on him and actually peck and pull at these pieces of muscle just like a robin trying to pull a worm out of the ground finally the skin of the back was hanging in long ribbons and the entire area was an unrecognizable mass of torn bleeding tissue when it was determined by the centurion in charge that the prisoner was near death the beating was finally stopped why jesus didnt bleed to death and again you have to remember that this was done in the cold night air the very thing that caused his blood vessels and capillaries to constrict and actually cause the blood loss from this beating to be minimal we know that jesus was beaten in the face and head as he was mocked by the time the lord was crucified after his beatings its almost certain that both of his eyes were swollen shut and no doubt his nose was pouring blood again youd ask why jesus didnt bleed to death and again you have to remember that this was done in the cold night air the very thing that caused his blood vessels and capillaries to constrict and actually cause the blood loss from this beating to be minimal the half fainting jesus was then untied and allowed to slump to the stone pavement wet with his own blood during jesus trials and humiliation we also know that a crown of thorns was plaited and placed on his head the roman soldiers saw a great joke in the provincial jew claiming to be a king they throw a robe across his shoulders and place a stick in his hand for a scepter they still need a crown to make their travesty complete the soldiers taunted jesus making fun of him for claiming to be the king of the jews so they formed a crown out of reeds of thorns a small bundle of flexible branches covered with long thorns commonly used for firewood are plaited into the shape of a crown and this pressed into his scalp again there was copious bleeding as the thorns pierced the very vascular tissue they pressed the crown on his head so hard the scripture says the thorns pierced his skull the soldiers then placed a scarlet robe on his back to simulate the robe of a king again there is copious bleeding the scalp being one of the most vascular areas of the body after mocking him and striking him across the face the soldiers take the stick from his hand and strike him across the head driving the thorns deeper into his scalp finally they tire of their sadistic sport and the robe is torn from his back this had already become adherent to the clots of blood and serum in the wounds and its removal just as in the careless removal of a surgical bandage causes excruciating pain almost as though he were again being whipped and the wounds again begin to bleed in christs case this was done to mock him as being king of the jews in israel these thorns are about an inch and one half to two inches long and theyre as sharp as an ice pick the custom was to take a small three or four foot long reed and slap the thorns on top of the head of the victim in order to drive the thorns into the skull those thorns laid upon someones head and then tapped down with a reed were hard enough to penetrate the outer table or the outer bone of the skull imagine the bleeding from three or four hundred puncture wounds in the scalp and around the forehead from these thorns so before jesus crucifixion even began his face has been beaten to a pulp no doubt his eyes were swollen shut his nose is bloodied and i remind you that every pore in his skin has wept and oozed blood every visible surface on the good lord jesus was covered and caked with dried blood and his back and his arms and his buttocks and the back of his legs were literally torn to shreds from the scourging this was the shape jesus was in before they gave him his cross to head out to calvary
2859580 father forgive them for they know not what they do
2859581 i am poured out like water and all my bones are out of joint my heart is like wax it is melted in the midst of my bowels
2859582 my strength is dried up like a potsherd and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws and thou has brought me into the dust of death
2859583 jesus said to her i am the resurrection and the life he who believes in me will live even though he dies
2859584 for we know that since christ was raised from the dead he cannot die again death no longer has mastery over him the death he died he died to sin once for all but the life he lives he lives to god in the same way count yourselves dead to sin but alive to god in christ jesus
2859585 i am the good shepherd the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep
2859586 the reason my father loves me is that i lay down my life only to take it up again no one takes it from me but i lay it down of my own accord i have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again this command i received from my father
2859587 i and the father are one and no one comes to the father but through me
2859588 jesus christ was only a reincarnation or rebirth of someone else others came before christ
2859589 i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith thelord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty
2859590 greater love hath no man than this that a man should lay down his life for his friends
2859591 if christ has not been raised our preaching is useless and so is your faith we are then found to be false witnesses about god for we have testified about god that he raised christ from the dead
2859592 if christ has not been raised your faith is futile you are still in your sins then those also who have fallen sleep in christ are lost if only for this life we have hope in christ we are to be pitied more than all men
2859593 but christ has indeed been raised from the dead the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep
2859594 destroy this temple and i will raise it again in three days
2859595 the next day the one after preparation day the chief priests and the pharisees went to pilate
2859596 for what i received i passed on to you as of first importance that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures that he was buried that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures and that he appeared to peter and then to the twelve after that he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time most of whom are still living though some have fallen asleep
2859597 after jesus suffering he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive he appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of god
2859598 brothers we do not want you to be ignorant about those who fall asleep or to grieve like the rest of men who have no hope
2859599 if you confess with your mouth jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved
2859600 everyone who looks to the son and believes in him shall have eternal life and i will raise him up on the last day
2859601 christ died for our sins and he was raised for our justification
2859602 we believe that jesus died and rose again and so we believe that god will bring with jesus those who have fallen asleep in him
2859603 we were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that just as christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the father we too may live a new life
2859604 for he god has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed
2859605 moreover the father judges no one but has entrusted all judgment to the son
2859606 and he has given him authority to judge because he is the son of man do not be amazed at this for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice and come out those who have done good will rise to live and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned
2859607 believe in the lord jesus and you will be saved
2859608 if it is possible let this cup pass from me but not my will but thine be done

2859611 i said i would im here yours for the taking why dont you come onto the bed and we can get started

2859613 i didnt hurt him i am a daemon of my word he was easy to find he was the only one of my minions moping i dont see that much in my kind he begged me not to kill you i asked him why he loved you so much what was so different about this human woman than the others he had fed from you know what he said
2859614 he said that you saw beyond the physical with him he wasnt just a dream lover you made him into a real man it wasnt because you could dreamwalk but because when you looked at him no matter what form he took you saw through the illusion and knew it was him
2859615 i cant do that tabby then you would have power over me
2859616 most people hope for someone to share their life with and have around to wake up with on a lazy sunday morning but then there are the selfish self centered people who are too stupid and think that they can have anyone and everyone wants them these people that are constantly keeping options open rather than committing to someone that makes them smile make me sick the best you can hope for is total honesty no games and maybe someday you will wake up 50 years later and wonder when you had grandchildren
2859617 we are scared of being hurt so we put up armor and behave as we think others want us to behave so we are accepted and feel wanted sometimes people prefer to know they are wanted because love and commitment and risk are too scary its the easy way out

2859627 one homestead zip code 33033 leads miami dade county with 263 homes in different stages of foreclosure
2859628 in homestead 30 to 40 percent of the sales are distressed
2859629 homestead cannot recover until most of the foreclosure activity works its way through the system at this point we are in the middle of it

2859634 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
2859635 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
2859636 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
2859637 it was clear that too many unmistakable israeli systems in the possesion of the georgian army would be like a red cloth in the face of a raging bull as far as russia is concerned
2859638 and that the interception of three of these rpvs in the past three months was an expression of this anger not everyone in israel understood the sensitive nerve israel touched when it supplied such an advanced arms system to a country whose relations with russia are highly tense
2859639 we conducted a small job for them several years ago
2859640 the israeli is the main investor in the georgian economy everyone is there directly or indirectly
2859641 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
2859642 we are now in a fight against the great russia
2859643 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own

2859648 if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their money first by inflation and then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them around the banks will deprive the people of their property until their children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered
2859649 the near monopoly of power once enjoyed by sovereign entities is being eroded states must be prepared to cede some sovereignty to world bodies globalization thus implies that sovereignty is not only becoming weaker in reality but that it needs to become weaker the goal should be to redefine sovereignty for the era of globalization to find a balance between a world of fully sovereign states and an international system of either world government or anarchy
2859650 its been demonstrated that well within two minutes of watching television most people enter a hypnotic alpha state bordering on theta viewers in this state are no longer able to critically evaluate discern or pass judgement from their own moral database on the material being viewed the information just flows unimpeded into their subconscious year in and year out

2859652 all states have the duty to promote the achievement of general and complete disarmament under effective international control and to utilize the resources released by effective disarmament measures for the economic and social development of countries allocating a substantial portion of such resources as additional means for the development needs of developing countries
2859653 it is important that we do not content ourselves only with the actual disarmament efforts world disarmament is needed for world development but equally world development is a prerequisite for world disarmament not until we have arrived at a situation of reasonable equity and economic balance in the world will it be possible to develop conditions for a lasting disarmament
2859654 i believe we are seeing the convergence of the physical and social worlds with the moral and spiritual the concepts of loving caring and sharing for a saner more cooperative world are the indispensable foundations on which the future security system for a small planet must now be based
2859655 poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems it is therefore futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader perspective that encompasses the factors underlying world poverty and international inequality
2859656 on earth she gaia is the source of life everlasting and is alive now she gave birth to humankind and we are a part of her
2859657 we are required by our religious principles to look for the links between equity and ecology the fundamental emphasis is on issues of environmental justice including air pollution and global warming water food and agriculture population and consumption hunger trade and industrial policy community economic development toxic pollution and hazardous waste and corporate responsibility
2859658 gentlemen comrades do not be concerned about all you hear about glasnost and perestroika and democracy in the coming years they are primarily for outward consumption there will be no significant internal changes in the soviet union other than for cosmetic purposes our purpose is to disarm the americans and let them fall asleep
2859659 those who hope that we shall move away from the socialist path will be greatly disappointed every part of our program of perestroika and the program as a whole for that matter is fully based on the principle of more socialism and more democracy we will proceed toward better socialism rather than away from it we are saying this honestly without trying to fool our own people or the world any hopes that we will begin to build a different non socialist society and go over to the other camp are unrealistic and futile we the soviet people are for socialism we want more socialism and therefore more democracy

2859664 yeah yall have such a quick temper one minute he is mad as hell and scratching out eyes and the next he is all smiles and happy as pie yall are some scary people
2859665 there are none so blind as those who will not see
2859666 the real rulers in washington are invisible and exercise power from behind the scenes
2859667 the real truth of the matter is as you and i know that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government ever since the days of andrew jackson
2859668 outwardly we have a constitutional government we have operating within our government and political system another body representing another form of government a bureaucratic elite which believes our constitution is outmoded
2859669 give me control over a nations currency and i care not who makes its laws
2859670 nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences
2859671 the bold effort the present bank had made to control the government the distress it had wantonly produced are but premonitions of the fate that awaits the american people should they be deluded into a perpetuation of this institution or the establishment of another like it
2859672 the central bank is an institution of the most deadly hostility existing against the principles and form of our constitution if the american people allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency first by inflation and then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all their property until their children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered
2859673 the money trust caused the 1907 panic and thereby forced congress to create a national monetary commission
2859674 the congress shall have power to coin money regulate the value thereof
2859675 this act establishes the most gigantic trust on earth the invisible government by the money power proven to exist by the money trust investigation will be legalized
2859676 when the federal reserve act was passed the people of these united states did not perceive that a world banking system was being set up here a super state controlled by international bankers and industrialists acting together to enslave the world every effort has been made by the fed to conceal its powers but the truth is the fed has usurped the government
2859677 the new law will create inflation whenever the trusts want inflation they can unload the stocks on the people at high prices during the excitement and then bring on a panic and buy them back at low prices the day of reckoning is only a few years removed
2859678 by the time the 16th amendment had been approved by the states the rockefeller foundation was in full operation
2859679 the constitution product of eighteenth century minds was thoroughly outdated that the country would be better off if the constitution could be scrapped and rewritten
2859680 the lusitania was deliberately sent at considerably reduced speed into an area where a u boat was known to be waiting escorts withdrawn
2859681 not a single idea in the covenant of the league was original with the president
2859682 such potentates of international banking as j p morgan john d rockefeller paul warburg otto kahn and jacob schiff the same clique which had engineered the establishment of the federal reserve system
2859683 a front group for j p morgan and company in association with the very small american round table group
2859684 while monopoly control of industries was once the objective of j p morgan and j d rockefeller by the late nineteenth century the inner sanctums of wall street understood the most efficient way to gain an unchallenged monopoly was to go political and make society go to work for the monopolists under the name of the public good and the public interest
2859685 these are the rules of big business get a monopoly let society work for you and remember that the best of all business is politics
2859686 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
2859687 it was the calculated shearing of the public by the world money powers triggered by the planned sudden shortage of call money in the new york market
2859688 most of his thoughts his political ammunition were carefully manufactured for him in advance by the cfr one world money group brilliantly he exploded that prepared ammunition in the middle of an unsuspecting target the american people and thus paid off and retained his internationalist political support
2859689 managing the world economy a smooth and peaceful evolution of the global system
2859690 the present united nations organization is actually the creation of the cfr and is housed on land in manhattan donated to it by the family of current cfr chairman david rockefeller
2859691 the most powerful cliques in these elitist groups have one objective in common they want to bring about the surrender of the sovereignty and national independence of the united states
2859692 elimination of all armed forces and armaments except those needed to maintain internal order within states and to furnish the united nations with peace forces by the time it un global government would be so strong no nation could challenge it
2859693 much smaller group but more powerful made up of wall street international bankers and their key agents primarily they want the world banking monopoly from whatever power ends up in control of the global government this cfr faction is headed by the rockefeller brothers
2859694 american participants in the paris peace conference decided that it was time for more private americans to become familiar with the increasing responsibilities and obligations of the united states there was a need for an organization able to provide for the continuous study of u s foreign police for the benefit of its members emphasis mine and a wider audience of interested americans
2859695 exchange views with american and foreign officials and policy experts discuss foreign policy issues consider international issues of concern to the business community
2859696 affiliated groups of community leaders throughout the united states meet with decision makers
2859697 a council member was elected president of the united states dozens of other council colleagues were called to serve in cabinet and sub cabinet positions
2859698 take some risks in order to invite others to pool their sovereignty with ours
2859699 in short the house of world order will have to be built from the bottom up rather than from the top down an end run around national sovereignty eroding it piece by piece will accomplish much more than the old fashioned assault
2859700 we shall have world government whether or not you like it by conquest or consent
2859701 risk that it will promptly be widely circulated or published
2859702 federal control of everything since they intend to control the federal government

2859720 you do what you have to do so that you can do what you want to do
2859721 its like cow crap the more you step in it the more it stinks
2859722 the jury should not be encouraged to base its verdict on what it speculates the absent witness would have testified to in the absence of some direct evidence
2859723 there must be a finding of intentional destruction indicating a desire to suppress the truth
2859724 tested the limits of what we are able to uphold as a bad faith determination
2859725 historically spoliation only arose from the intentional destruction of evidence and therefore a finding that the spoliator intentionally destroyed the evidence was a prerequisite to prevail in a motion for sanctions for spoliation
2859726 a finding of no intent is no longer dispositive of the issue
2859727 the first official message ever in which he speaks english
2859728 calls for the people to support jihad in pakistan and lists a litany of grievances against the pakistani government and us involvement there
2859729 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
2859730 also relates his own personal experiences having lived in pakistan in an apparent attempt to build a stronger connection with the pakistani people

2859738 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2859739 but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins

2859741 dalle macerie hanno gi estratto una trentina di corpi martoriati tra questi una donna incinta tre vecchietti che stavano prendendo il fresco due bambini che giocavano in cortile tutti civili

2859756 convite para participar com ele no servi o dos outros
2859757 even so consider yourselves to be dead to sin but alive to god in christ jesus therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts and do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness but present yourselves to god as those alive form the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness to god for sin shall not be master over you for you are not under law but under grace
2859758 therefore confess your sins to one another and pray for one another so that you may be healed the effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much
2859759 it was for freedom that christ set us free therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery
2859760 but i say walk by the spirit and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh for the flesh sets its desire against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh for these are in opposition to one another so that you may not do the things that you please
2859761 now those who belong to christ jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires if we live by the spirit let us also walk by the spirit
2859762 for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death
2859763 for those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh but those who are according to the spirit the things of the spirit for the mind set on the spirit is life and peace becasue the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward god for it does not subject itself to the law of god for it is not even able to do so and those who are in the flesh cannot please god however you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if indeed the spirit of god dwells in you
2859764 therefore if you have been raised up with christ keep seeking the things above where christ is seated at the right hand of god set your mind on the things above not on the things that are on earth for you have died and your life is hidden with christ in god
2859765 do not love the world nor the things in the world if anyone loves the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life is not from the father but is from the world the world is passing away and also its lusts but the one who does the will of god lives forever
2859766 for whatever is born of god overcomes the world and this is the victory that has overcome the world our faith who is the one who overcomes the world but he who believes that jesus is the son of god
2859767 you are from god little children and have overcome them because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world
2859768 be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god and the peace of god which surpasses all comprehension will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus
2859769 finally bretheren whatever is true whatever is honorable whatever is right whatever is pure whatever is lovely wheatever is of good repute if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise dwell on these things the things you have learned and received and heard and seen in me practice these things and the god of peace will be with you

2859779 we are disappointed the court granted viacoms overreaching demand for viewing history we will ask viacom to respect users privacy and allow us to anonymise the logs before producing them under the courts order
2859780 viacom and other plaintiffs never should have demanded private viewing data in the first place
2859781 they should have agreed a week ago to let us anonymize it our users privacy should not be held hostage to advance the plaintiffs additional litigation interests

2859824 jika salah seorang antara kalian marah sedang pada saat itu ia dalam keadaan berdiri maka hendaklah ia duduk namun jika tidak hilang juga marahnya maka hendaklah ia berbaring
2859825 sesungguhnya marah itu daripada syaitan dan sesungguhnya syaitan itu diciptakan daripada api dan api itu hanya dapat dipadamkan dengan air oleh kerana itu jika salah seorang daripada kamu marah maka hendaklah ia berwuduk
2859826 barang sesiapa menahan amarahnya pada hal ia mampu untuk menumpahkannya maka allah akan memanggilnya di hadapan para pemimpin makhluk lalu allah memberinya kebebasan untuk memilih bidadari mana yang ia sukai
2859827 barang sesiapa yang ingin dimuliakan tempat tinggalnya dan ditinggikan darjatnya maka hendaklah ia memberi maaf kepada orang yang menzaliminya memberi kepada orang yang tidak mahu memberi kepadanya dan menyambung silaturahim kepada orang yang memutuskannya
2859828 dan bagi orang yang dizalimi mereka akan membela diri dan balasan sesuatu kejahatan adalah kejahatan yang sama maka sesiapa yang memaafkan dan berbuat baik maka pahalanya adalah tanggungan allah sesungguhnya dia tidak menyukai orang zalim
