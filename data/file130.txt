1300001 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1300002 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point its focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand

1300004 standard chartered has been the darling of the uk banking sector for some time now and these numbers will no doubt further cement the positive general consensus
1300005 we are in the right markets at the right time doing the right things
1300006 we expect a bit of a slowdown in most of our markets relative to the pace at which theyve been travelling but they will still be travelling at gdp growth rates well in excess of what would be regarded as pretty fast growth rates for western markets
1300007 many of our markets we anticipate to grow at rates of 6 7 or 8 per cent through this year and into 2009
1300008 at the moment and at this price level there is no movement within opec to do anything

1300053 healthcare has underutilized e mail compared to most other industries
1300054 actually the number of people opting in to receive this kind of communication has doubled over the past couple of years on the physician side most companies are not emailing physicians and its probably one of the biggest missed opportunities we see
1300055 its a wonderful format for consumers and physicians and now that we have such widely available broadband video will become a big part of how we communicate
1300056 weve seen the profound impact of youtube and others video will become an important tool for marketers and well need agencies that have this capability
1300057 were just beginning to use video approaches with them but i can see ecme done by video in a much more ubiquitous way
1300058 no matter where you are as we look at e channels to contact customers the question is how do you pull it all together
1300059 all of this is generating enormous amounts of information and the most efficient marketers in the future are going to be those who can gather and continuously refine their segmentation approach and ways to contact individual customers that effectively is closed loop
1300060 the only way to do that is closed loop marketing where you end up with as many segments as individuals
1300061 there are more barriers but those innovative and dedicated enough to do it have greater competitive advantage
1300062 you have to show them that its adding value though
1300063 you have to look at the whole e marketing approach to see how you can provide value for customers in europe you have to show that to clear regulatory hurdles anyway and that could be something the us could learn from

1300070 but i would agree that there are movement elements within progressive politics today
1300071 still while referring to a progressive movement does give people a feeling of being part of something bigger its important that progressives have a sense of our own history and that we not throw around the term movement too loosely
1300072 i do feel connected to people and organizations that are working on particular issues on a local state or national level but that feels very different than being part of an overarching national movement
1300073 its a wish more than an accomplished fact to say that there is a single progressive movement there are movements plural some moving more vigorously than others insofar as there is a single movement its a reaction to the depredations of the bush years

1300117 just as were speaking a pickup truck is coming across our scale with some farm equipment and some old barbed wire fence
1300118 they get money here and they supplement their income and pay for their food and their fuel and their rent and everything else
1300119 a year or two ago im sure i would have probably just went out to dinner or maybe even went to the movies or something to that effect rather than filling up my tank

1300129 we do have a very strong team better financed and better resourced than ever and i believe this will deliver the goods and we will move significantly forward from 10th
1300130 for a number of sports we also want to see real progress towards 2012 we are confident we will move forward from 10th but it would be unwise to speculate how close we will get to fourth at athens the combined margin of five british golds being silver medals was only 0 545sec that shows how close it can be
1300131 the target of 35 medals and eighth place in the medal table remains the same
1300132 we do have a stretch target of 41 medals that we would hope to achieve if everything goes right and that also remains the same
1300133 i do not anticipate the boa changing the by law at all
1300134 what we need to do is look at the appeal mechanism the rest of the world is looking at what we do and a number are considering having similar eligibility rules
1300135 ultimately the reason we have the by law is that it is asked for by the athletes we carry out a poll after every games and there has never been less than 90 supporting it there is a huge challenge for sport to make sure we have competition between athletes and not between chemist laboratories

1300158 the wasps captaincy is probably one of the biggest challenges of my career so far
1300159 this season coming is pretty special for wasps as the guinness premiership champions we will want to keep hold of our silverware and pick up even more honours
1300160 we have a fantastic squad filled with lots of young and exciting talent and i am very proud to lead this group of players
1300161 2008 09 will also be a very special year for our international players competing for places for the lions tour of south africa which is a goal many of my team mates can reach
1300162 my priority will be to make sure everyone delivers for the club first
1300163 i want us to keep winning and as the captain it is my job to ensure we stay focused
1300164 when wasps director of rugby ian mcgeechan spoke to me about the captaincy my first thought went to lawrence dallaglio
1300165 hes a great leader and an absolute legend of this game nobody will ever replace him ever and for me it has been a great honour to play both alongside him at wasps and against him in the international arena
1300166 it is with his support that i take this role he is a great friend and he will continue to be even though he will no longer be at the club
1300167 what raf has achieved his character and the way he operates is first class and there is no more deserving a man for the job
1300168 with the departure of lawrence dallaglio there are of course some big boots to fill
1300169 but raf is one of the most highly regarded players in the professional game who so easily commands the respect of all those around him
1300170 2008 09 looks set to be a season of challenge for the premiership clubs with the introduction of the elvs experimental law variations and the new rugby football union rfu agreement which will see us without so many of our key players

1300267 there were other ideas around like paul baran at rand but they were nowhere near as useful as what donald davies did in terms of size of packets and nodes
1300268 it was donald who had the idea of making a set of nodes that you send packets of data to that find their own way through
1300269 they had a whole series of early computers at npl that they turned in to a local area network lan

1300311 una de las mayores alegr as ha sido el liderazgo de piqueras

1300313 aumentan las ofertas la demanda es la misma y cada d a es m s complicado fidelizar a los espectadores y atender a sus gustos
1300314 telecinco ha reafirmado su liderazgo por cuarta temporada consecutiva y sigue manteniendo ese esp ritu de televisi n muy comercial y muy pendiente en cada momento de lo que el espectador demanda

1300324 obviously as it is a concern to countries in the region as well as a concern to us
1300325 terrorism is a threat to the people of the region to the people of nations like pakistan but also a threat to the wider world
1300326 we all need to understand that situation we all need to do all that we can to correct whoever was involved in that bombing but the only way we are ever going to get a hold of this problem is through cooperation of the nations of the region and through cooperation with the nations of the region
1300327 i think we heard very strong determination on his gilani part for the sake of pakistan to conquer the problem of terrorism to conquer the problem of extremism which afflicts so many of their citizens there which really is a problem which people in pakistan are justifiably worried about for themselves
1300328 washingtons pledge for working with the countries in the region to fight the scourge of terrorism to build up their capabilities to maintain security throughout their territory and to help them with their goal of extending good governance
1300329 whether it is some of the things i cited in terms of preventing supplies to terrorists in sri lanka or working with the government of bangladesh to end the terrorist threat there or working very actively in afghanistan and cooperating with pakistan and working with india against terrorism in the end that is the best solution to the problem of
1300330 my biggest worry with pietersen is that he gets a bit far above himself and doesnt keep his feet on the ground
1300331 hes got to remember who his friends are if he keeps that in mind he will be all right he has as much talent as anyone that has ever played the game
1300332 we are preparing to bring prius into the indian market though we have not set any timeline yet
1300333 in the run up we have to develop skills to service it and make spare parts available across the country
1300334 in the long run it is economical with higher mileage and lower maintenance cost we are confident of its acceptability in the indian market as it runs both on electricity and fuel
1300335 the selectors are discussing changes in the pace department and whether to continue with michael vandort
1300336 kirsten will not be available for the third test match as he will be leaving from colombo for south africa tonight there will not be any replacement in his absence
1300337 kirsten coach indian team has been granted leave to go to south africa to be with his mother as she is critically ill
1300338 it will help the players to be part of a worldwide movement cricket is an exciting sport and should definitely be part of the olympics
1300339 if you want to globalise the game then you have to look at including countries like china and the united states and getting cricket into the olympics will fast track that move
1300340 i have been experimenting since 2003 however the tsunami destroyed my lab the following year i had to restart my research and the effort was worth it
1300341 earlier no free cultured pearl had been formed in this particular species because of its features they are very sensitive to outside element and usually die when any foreign body is implanted

1300344 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate there are some things we need to go through
1300345 the reputation of this team has been damaged no question
1300346 i dont think its beyond repair and i dont think the reputation has been ruined but certainly it has taken some hits
1300347 hes got some stiffness and well just see what it is i didnt think it was anything serious just because the velocity was still there
1300348 its in the deltoid below my shoulder strength is fine velocity is fine
1300349 he said he felt ok but ive got to hear that he feels great
1300350 t o establish that a workplace constitutes a hostile work environment a plaintiff must show that the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation ridicule and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victims employment and create an abusive working environment
1300351 alter the conditions of the victims employment and create an abusive working though this decision is well written i am a bit surprised that it even reached this level
1300352 there has never been a thought towards returning to waterfall we only think about how to be more agile how to do this better no one wants to go back
1300353 loss of hair is not going to kill anybody at the same time for some people hair loss can be a really traumatic thing especially for women
1300354 these new figures should bring new focus to our efforts to address aids and hiv here at home
1300355 combating hiv aids also demands closing the gaps in opportunity that exist in our society so that we can strengthen our public health we must also overcome the stigma that surrounds hiv aids a stigma that is too often tied to homophobia
1300356 we need to encourage folks to get tested and accelerate hiv aids research toward an effective cure because we have a moral obligation to join together to meet this challenge and to do so with the urgency this epidemic demands
1300357 well we do not really believe we can deliver but we thought this is the plan management wanted
1300358 israel you need to cross a chasm of biblical proportions
1300359 be sure yourself and your own reach to know how far your genius taste and learning go launch not beyond your depth but be discreet and mark that point where sense and dullness meet
1300360 we should speak on behalf of the unborn and contend for the sanctity of all human life from conception to natural death
1300361 activities on the lords day should be commensurate with the christians conscience under the lordship of jesus christ
1300362 activities on the lords day should be commensurate with the christians submission to the dictates of holy scripture under the lordship of jesus christ
1300363 the baptist faith and message yes thats the book for me i stand alone on the bfm the baptist faith and message
1300364 the lords day is a christian institution for regular observance and should be employed in exercises of worship and spiritual devotion both public and private resting from worldly employments and amusements works of necessity and mercy only excepted
1300365 therefore as soon as they are capable of moral action they become transgressors and are under condemnation
1300366 unless agile methods are quantifying critical success criteria theyre incrementally better than waterfall methods
1300367 give us more time to sell weve got lots of issues with our systems but if we just had more time to sell wed generated more revenue
1300368 reduce the time it takes to open a new account

1300371 god siva whats the deal why are all these clocks here in heaven
1300372 the clocks keep track of things on earth there is one clock for each person every time the person on earth tells a lie his clock moves one minute
1300373 for instance this clock is for vk lingam the lawyer if you watch it closely it will move
1300374 he must have just said correct correct correct i see it jumps like that quite often
1300375 that clock belongs to the lawyer karpal singh he is one of the finest god fearing people on earth i bet his clock hasnt moved in a year or two
1300376 ive seen everyones clock but mr samy vellus where is his clock
1300377 just look up we use his clock as a ceiling fan thats why it is so cooling here
1300378 strong evidence and circumstantial evidence of american acquiescence to terrorism inside pakistan
1300379 carrying what were seen as india influenced intelligence inputs had hardened the resolve of pakistans security establishment to keep supreme pakistans national security interest even if it meant straining ties with the us and nato
1300380 not to distinguish between a terrorist for the united states and afghanistan and a terrorist for pakistan
1300381 the government is in deep slumber we are trying to show light and give a wake up call but the government is in greater slumber than even kumbhkarana a character in the epic ramayana who slept for six months at a stretch

1300401 it would be an unforgivable injustice to a good man he is one of our best we are privileged to have public servants of the calibre of mr pikoli he is highly principled sometimes he might be pedantic and therefore rub people up the wrong way but we badly need government officers like him
1300402 that is an unexplained event it is unconstitutional and unlawful it is in fact a criminal instruction in terms of the npa act
1300403 we simply dont know how this came about because the minister has never explained it to us and only she can
1300404 what we do know is that this was the beginning of the end
1300405 you will never drive this way again in your life
1300406 i have attempted to call the call center in quick succession 271 times not joking
1300407 people seem to judge by the long queues that the system is not working
1300408 a lot of the backlog is caused by the huge upsurge in the number of formerly disadvantaged people who can now afford to buy a car
1300409 in south africa getting a license can be far harder than driving
1300410 at current funding levels the backlog will not be eradicated and maintenance costs will escalate rapidly due the cost of maintaining an ageing road network 82 of the roads are older than the designed life of 20 years
1300411 if funding is available it would be possible to eliminate the backlog within five years
1300412 we need to be wary of how political control encroaches on reporting
1300413 the tribunal is not necessary as we have an appeals panel and are self regulated it threatens press freedom and contradicts the constitution
1300414 journalists have been unlawfully arrested and sanef has called for a meeting with the saps as a joint initiative to resolve the problems
1300415 we have the systems in place and it just needs to be made use of because if there are contraventions there will be dire consequences
1300416 arkmile is seeking declarations and orders from the court which if granted would prevent clil challenger life no 2 ltd and challenger management services ltd from voting any securities they hold in cif on the winding up resolution
1300417 in line with its target for an operating profit of about one billion euros
1300418 doesnt have a clue and doesnt want to have a clue
1300419 one gets tired of hearing about a few bad apples
1300420 that is absolute rubbish that is why we have this problem it is because they refuse to admit there is a problem and the more they are in denial the less chance we have of anything being rectified it is hard not to be negative
1300421 if the saps was a model of integrity those figures would make sense but i dont believe it for a moment
1300422 management controls are generally weak in the saps there is no systematic approach to corruption and there is no investigative unit looking specifically at corruption
1300423 the station where he would work night shift there was never a senior officer on duty the entire night shift staff was rotten and if there was a policeman who wasnt hed be worked out
1300424 if they got a call and they were having a braai or drinks at the back of the station they just wouldnt go but if the local gang called on them they would go because that is who was paying them they were in it together it was a completely symbiotic relationship
1300425 the key to combating corruption and fraud in the saps is effective supervision of saps employees at all levels but particularly at station level corruption and fraud will not be tolerated in this police service and those found guilty will be dealt with to the full extent of the law and the saps disciplinary regulations
1300426 we are detecting a lot of corruption cases which is a good thing we are not saying there is more corruption we are saying more is being detected we must show corrupt elements that we are taking no nonsense
1300427 in the past we included all criminal cases under the heading corruption related crimes we now have a strict definition of corruption
1300428 you can also argue that it is low because cases are not reported or it is low because we are doing something about it we can only look at that when we do an internal survey to determine what is happening
1300429 if you want to look at the rottenness you can include all their crimes into the category of corruption because of the nature of their job and the powers they have they are not like ordinary criminals
1300430 i cannot vouch for them it could be that the systems have more included
1300431 nobody liked those guys they only investigated there was no prevention what we did after them we looked at broadening the strategy we wanted to prevent corruption so we asked the question how do we detect corruption
1300432 we have been criticised for closing down the anti corruption unit but they only investigated this plan is a departure from the way we did business we are now looking at all aspects
1300433 we are arresting people in the police college who have fake certificates
1300434 once a case is registered you can try and cover up as much as you want i can guarantee you that once a case has been registered it will be investigated
1300435 if a case of corruption happens at for example hillbrow then people from vereeniging will go and investigate
1300436 with such high levels of crime in the country and the limited capacity we have do you want us to slash that capacity to concentrate on looking for corruption
1300437 often used as a way of pretending to the world that something is being done about the problem
1300438 it is all about service delivery why are we doing this
1300439 it is a crazy crazy concept that is completely against any international norm and international best practice new york and london all have separate removed investigation units it is the only way you can do it
1300440 we dont have any sort of strategy and they the police are not interested in devising one properly or implementing one
1300441 people close ranks that is the problem it is something that has been going on for years ever since the police existed

1300453 if leading indicators like the pmis are of any reliability then we are headed toward a period of serious stagnation in the euro zone

1300455 with confidence plummeting amid weaker growth of new business in germany the euro zones largest national economy is also looking in danger of sliding into contraction soon

1300540 national departments will be asked to find efficiency savings of about r2 3 billion over the next three years by limiting spending on unnecessary entertainment travel and hotel accommodation misplaced branding and communications initiatives and poorly managed consultancy services and related frills
1300541 the perceived lack of action from the executive to address this problem impacts negatively on public confidence in the accountability systems of the public service where the a g has expressed a qualified audit opinion there is reason for management and the executive to be seriously concerned and to be accordingly called to account hopefully the recent call by cabinet for affected eas and hods to urgently address the weaknesses that give rise to the qualified audit findings will result in the much needed action in this area this move by cabinet is certainly a positive one although it should have been taken earlier given the long history of qualified audit opinions in some departments however the administrative and executive leadership concerned still has a full financial year ahead of them during which to get their act together and effect improvements that will leave their departments on a sound financial footing
1300542 governments poor financial performance raise s important questions about the seriousness with which governments system of accountability is being taken what is it that is being done to ensure that the concerns that lead to such qualifications are being addressed who is being held accountable for such consistently poor audit outcomes for how much longer is this trend going to continue and what is its impact on service delivery while it may not be possible to generalise on the challenges that the above departments face the time has come to seriously reflect on these matters in the interest of effective and accountable public administration
1300543 in each of his reports on the departments finances since 2000 the auditor general has highlighted several critical financial management problems within the department it seems that the minister and her department simply ignore these reports because no obvious action is ever taken to address them and the same problems continue to be raised year after year
1300544 an overview of the audit outcomes of government departments over the past five financial years proves that too many government ministers and directors general are simply unable to provide proper financial management of public money indeed in many cases the overview paints a picture of financial disarray and mismanagement on a grand scale
1300545 there are two consequences of serious financial mismanagement first efficient service delivery is compromised and the people suffer as a result second public confidence in the state is undermined compromising the legitimacy of the state in the eyes of the public

1300552 korupsi adalah ideologi terlarang dan bahaya laten pada hakikatnya sama dengan kejahatan terorisme yang pelakunya tidak berhak mendapat remisi
1300553 jika presiden memberi remisi kepada narapidana korupsi berarti presiden tidak mendukung program pemberantasan korupsi hal itu juga berarti presiden mengkhianati instruksi presiden nomor 5 tahun 2004 tentang pemberantasan korupsi
1300554 penting untuk menghadirkan efek jera salah satu efek jera itu jika menerapkan hukum yang seberat beratnya dan secepat cepatnya yakni hukuman mati

1300571 she has been with me through thick and thin and she is still with me today i cant imagine life without her
1300572 after my wifes death times were tough my last born child bella was a few days old when her mother passed away
1300573 i then met another white woman thinking she could help me raise my children but it did not work out then sarah and i started seeing each other
1300574 i went to my mother and explained to her that i was to marry sarah she told me that the decision was mine to take and she would give her blessing and thats exactly what i did i married sarah and i have never looked back ever since
1300575 people used to ask me how i could be married to a white man
1300576 it was hard for some people to accept it at first but they eventually got used to it it was a bit awkward for me to shift from being his kitchen girl and get used to being his wife
1300577 i have always loved him and love has nothing to do with colour but everything to do with feelings
1300578 i love this place and i was one of the first people to acquire land here
1300579 you cannot please everybody and yes there were a few people who passed a rude comment about us but eventually it all passed my neighbours on the other hand are good people
1300580 i have six grandchildren from my son and my daughter its a great mixture and they all get along very well
1300581 bella dislikes going to visit some of my family members because she cannot speak english properly and does not understand afrikaans at all
1300582 its because of how she was brought up and i would not have it any differently
1300583 they teased me for a while but they got used to it only people that do not know that we live here find our situation awkward but it does not bother me
1300584 i even bought her a new stove and as you can see it is still there

1300591 i still have plenty of tournaments to do well in and i hope i can start here at the olympics and fulfill my dream to win gold
1300592 i know eight is the lucky number here maybe because my birthday and everything that has also brought me luck here in china who knows
1300593 i hope being able to carry the flag for switzerland which is a great honor for me starting with that and then hopefully performing well its going to be a dream olympics for me
1300594 i usually always stay at hotels all year long at tournaments so i said you know this time ill try this way
1300595 but i have to say the village is beautiful very nice very well done here with the vegetation and everything so its nice to be able to be part of the team like that
1300596 im here a few days earlier than in previous olympics
1300597 for our purposes usually were there 2 3 days ahead but now 7 8 days so actually thats a lot of practice and i had a good flight in from the states which is a long trip but i feel fine
1300598 everyone has a chance well see down the stretch who is going to have the best day and i hope its going to be me

1300625 i was informed by the typist that one volume had been partially completed when the computer got corrupted by a virus and she has to type it up all over again
1300626 wie die aachener zeitungen heute morgen berichteten ist ein maschinenbaustudent v llig ausgeflippt
1300627 it looks as though he has put before the public a plea to be patient
1300628 i demand president maung maung form an interim government immediately to avoid anarchy and bloodshed in the country
1300629 democracy can only be obtained in a peaceful and unified way
1300630 no one should resort to violence and bloodshed there should be no more killing of students soldiers and people
1300631 the burmese believe the looting is being carried out deliberately by the military to break law and order
1300632 if the disorder continues it will be the perfect excuse for the military to step in as they did in 1962

1300635 this isnt about rebuilding retooling or anything this is about going for it
1300636 thats our approach its pedal to the metal thats what every move is based on or what every attempted move is based on with an eye toward the present and an eye toward the future but were going for it
1300637 it gives the team stability its a collision sport you dont know how long the careers are its a difficult sport to work in for players i appreciate that a lot of players hit unrestricted free agency they may have had a mediocre season the year before they might have had an injury but its tough out there the security of being a multimillionaire i think is appealing still to both the team and the players then youll have to adjust if there are significant changes ups or downs
1300638 you just need two reasonable sides and usually these things do have a way of working themselves out weve never not worked something out with brian and hopefully this will play itself out well
1300639 i think you forget sometimes how successful hes been and weve been
1300640 show us and the league that hes back to the old lito feels healthy that hes got great playmaking ability and certainly a lower ypa yards per pass attempt against him and just really perform the way that we know lito can i think thats what hes going to do
1300641 it was an asinine decision and ill move forward better than i probably have ever had to its the first time in my life that i really havent forgiven myself
1300642 i go to bible study just like he does every week
1300643 for me not to be able to forgive him then id just be wasting my time going to bible study
1300644 it felt really good to get back out there with the guys and to test the waters out so to speak
1300645 when you get an injury as a rookie thats because of fatigue in the legs you get that same exact injury at 35 its because youre old its the same injury i have known that i had six years ago hyperextended the knee
1300646 but since im nearly 35 now its because im older im going to go out and whatever i can give im going to give if i am not the same brian dawkins then well talk about being that brian dawkins if im not im not i anticipate being me
1300647 i only know one way to play that is full speed i have always done it that way
1300648 i put a whole lot of time in early really early
1300649 when i train i dont know what a 35 year old person is supposed to be doing all i know is i need to have my body right and these are things ive done in the past to get my body right
1300650 i dont want him to but our chemistry is great
1300651 ive been here with him for quite some time asante is a little different
1300652 once he gets on the field hell know how were going to try and play it and hell let me know how he wants to play it
1300653 when youre coming into a scheme there are some things where theres not a lot of wiggle room
1300654 those are the types of things asante is trying to learn on the run a little bit where is the wiggle room for me to be able to do what i do best
1300655 i would never ever want to be a liability to my teammates
1300656 i doubt very seriously that when that time comes that i will come back because i would have exhausted everything in this tank
1300657 if i made comments every time i heard a rumor ill be talking to you every day and have to answer every question you the media ask
1300658 wherever ive been we had exceptional returners and there was no need for me back there
1300659 ive always been the next guy in line its a good thing those guys never got hurt but i never got a chance
1300660 coming here i knew there wasnt an established guy back there
1300661 i try to relate it to running the ball in the open field but you cant its not the same thing theres really not enough time to start and stop you have to make a decision and go with it
1300662 one thing we were questioning there was whether or not he would able to break off the tackles and hes shown during some live practice sessions that he is capable of breaking tackles
1300663 i havent talked to brett favre and i really havent followed it that close to be honest with you i try not to look at too much of the news im too busy right now
1300664 i have the simplest of tastes i like only the best
1300665 this isnt about rebuilding retooling or anything were going for it thats what every move is based on
1300666 part of the reason im real pumped up about this season is finally we have a real healthy donovan mcnabb who looks great out there
1300667 i think andy reid and the personnel people have done a great job of retooling the defense with young fast players to go along with the veteran mix we have were much more athletic on offense
1300668 weve had the best quarterback in the nfc for quite a while thats not the case when hes not 100 percent or not there when hes healthy we have a terrific record
1300669 adapt to where things are at you try to be fair and do contracts when they make sense for the team youre trying to spread it out the best you can so you have the best possible roster
1300670 i think you want every player to be happy especially a professional like brian hes great one of my favorites you just need two reasonable sides and usually these things do have a way of working themselves out hopefully this will play out well
1300671 i will say that im very hopeful that lito will have a terrific season hell show us and the league that hes back to the old lito that hes healthy that hes got tremendous playmaking ability and certainly a lower ypa
1300672 other players get reps and improve because thats the game of football youve got to prepare hes been hurt before so weve had to prepare anyway any time a player misses the work thats being done and the bonding with teammates even though hes a veteran and a very good player it disappoints me
1300673 it felt good real real good to be out there with the guys to test the waters out so to speak just to get back out there and sweat with the guys
1300674 he looks like the old dawk hes always taking care of his body in the hot tub getting massages and stretching hes doing all the little extra things that you think you can get away without doing when youre younger
1300675 you get an injury when you are a rookie and its because you have fatigued legs you get an injury when youre 35 the same exact injury and its because youre old same injury i had now is the same one i had about 6 years ago hyperextended knee its the same injury but because im 35 now its because im getting older
1300676 dawk is the kind of guy you can never count out
1300677 hes the guy who never says quit he looks real good to me the same now as he does during the season i feel more comfortable with him on the field than i do with anybody else
1300678 look im gonna go out and whatever i can give im gonna give
1300679 i anticipate being me i only know one way to play and thats full speed and thats how ill do it ive always done it that way and im gonna go out and give all i can to those guys on game day thats how im gonna do it
1300680 youre talking about the cornerstone of the defense and of this team
1300681 after finally deciding to get professional help i felt like maybe talking about my situation could be a blessing to someone else going through the same things
1300682 regardless of whether youre a celebrity or you play for the philadelphia eagles and youre in the limelight you still go through problems
1300683 a lot of things in my life have happened even since ive come to philadelphia
1300684 random people have pulled out a gun on me one time during the playoffs some guy walked from around a building and said youre going to the pro bowl expletive him hes not going to the pro bowl luckily i was talking to someone and i didnt hear him if i heard it i think id have been on the ground
1300685 ive just had a lot of thoughts and questions going through my mind about a lot of things some things im embarrassed to talk about
1300686 but even dating back to when i was growing up people made fun of me i always wanted people to think i was more than what i was
1300687 when i got into the nfl i wanted to be man enough to admit that but i tried to use material things to say who i was i know now that some of the happiest times in my life were when i didnt have a pot to piss in im hoping this is just part of my growing process
1300688 ive never been a big fan of medication but at this point in my life i feel like every little bit helps i was at the end of the road
1300689 i didnt want anybody to see me walking into a psych clinic professionals arent always the answer sometimes just talking things out helps and now with all the rumors coming out it has only made things worse
1300690 some of the comments really got to me you always hear guys say that they dont care what people think and sometimes i dont about certain things but in the grand scheme i want people to think positive about me
1300691 i would have been there physically but mentally i wouldnt have been an asset to my team or myself i could have got myself or one of my teammates hurt
1300692 for a while i didnt work out and i didnt put my weight back on
1300693 i went about a month and i only gained two pounds but i started working out again and that helped me through some things im still 335 and in shape
1300694 i really do miss a lot of aspects of the game but my story everything is real if i sit here and lie to you im lying to myself hopefully the doctor will give me the ok to play but i wont say everything is ok if it isnt
1300695 thats college money for my son but whatever the number is that hasnt been my focus
1300696 i know the value of a dollar i come from a household of four where the weekly income was 200 or 300 dollars a week i just felt my mental health was more important than a dollar
1300697 i think every time weve talked he became more sensitive that i do have issues going on
1300698 ill admit that i said some things around my teammates that have created some of the rumors that have been going on but a lot of that was said out of anger i said i might give football up because i didnt know how to handle my anger this really has taken a toll on me mentally
1300699 i think that was just part of me trying to identify myself
1300700 ive always felt like i was different i feel like im an abstract person and i still wonder who shawn andrews is thats why you always see me joking around being around people and singing activates my fun side
1300701 at the end of the day this doesnt take away from my fun side but it has for the time being
1300702 i have the simplest of tastes i like only the best
1300703 i have the simplest of tastes i like only the best
1300704 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1300705 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1300706 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1300707 im willing to admit that ive been going through a very bad time with depression
1300708 ive had more sleepless nights i guess its come back to haunt me for ever bragging about not being stressed out
1300709 i kind of put my pride aside before something really bad happens
1300710 i have a meeting with my doc on thursday and hopefully ill be up that way on friday
1300711 the consequences are what they are im willing to accept them
1300712 football is important its a means to an end but my mental health i feel like is a lot more important it is a ton of money but at this time i dont feel like i can put a price tag on my mental state
1300713 as a guy who went through that early in my career taking the medication i certainly understand
1300714 prayer and having people around me that i knew cared about me
1300715 stop some of the bleeding start some of the healing process maybe a little bit
1300716 i just want to look em in the eye and let em all know this wasnt bs this was for the mental health of me i could have gone out there and gotten any one of you hurt
1300717 i like how spongebob handles life he gets picked on all the time but hes still happy he doesnt get angry with people he just goes through life with a smile on his face
1300718 i know there are harsh people in this world but dang that made me feel low i do care what people think about me to an extent
1300719 has kind of turned into this monster right now i know everybodys not forgiving i feel like my teammates will be but everybodys entitled to their own opinion
1300720 the judge ruled today that because hes evaded being served with the subpoena for so long hes obviously doing it for a reason and we can have what is called substitute of service which means you can put it onto someone else
1300721 were now serving the subpoena via text message via the toulon club and via his address in sydney
1300722 the idea is that we go back into court friday morning seeking an injunction and then if he decides to play in the face of the injunction then he can be up for some serious penalties
1300723 people who dont have anything to hide are usually easy to serve
1300724 weve spent a lot of time and effort and a lot of long nights dealing with trying to find out where he is
1300725 hell be at the very least in the stadium or better on the team sheet
1300726 he has confirmed his complete desire to finish with rugby league to switch over to union
1300727 our problem is is williams under contract with another rugby union side the answer is no
1300728 therefore hes free to join with whoever he wants he doesnt need a letter to leave
1300729 its about taking action against people who have induced a breach of contract where that leads im not sure
1300730 not yet thats part of the next process were working towards
1300731 there are many misunderstandings when it comes to the laws surrounding animal protection in alberta
1300732 for example many people believe that only the owner of an animal can be charged or considered responsible for the welfare of the animal in alberta you dont have to be the owner of an animal to be charged under the animal protection act apa the apa states that any person who fails to prevent an animal from being in distress can be charged
1300733 all animals including wildlife domestic and zoo animals in alberta are covered by the apa this means that both companion animals pets and livestock animals are protected by the apa
1300734 we want to commend the leadership on both sides of the aisle in the senate and house for approving this important legislation
1300735 congress action will help ensure that pork producers have access to products that keep our pigs healthy and our products safe and wholesome
1300736 and like lambs to the slaughter the braves take the field
1300737 having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
1300738 favre ive always had a passion for stopping things then starting to do things again
1300739 i guess a lot of the focus as usual is on the 1500m freetsyle for me
1300740 another good event for me is the 400m i feel like things have been going pretty well ive prepared well in that event also at the same time i guess i have made it clear that my focus in this preparation has been on that 1500m
1300741 i guess in some respects it feels like a bonus event for me and i would love to be able to better my personal best time in that that is my goal in that event at this stage and by how much im not sure
1300742 i guess i will wait and see how i feel on the day which is hopefully good
1300743 park has said that hell break it the world record well just wait and see how well he swims and what he can do
1300744 i am just looking forward to racing him and giving him a good race
1300745 i think having six world record holders assists us as a team it takes the pressure off one individual
1300746 booger taught me i could do anything i could do before the accident i just had to figure out a different way to do it
1300747 for the first time in the history of the jewish nation a situation has arisen in which the ruling party kadima is willing to offer jerusalems most precious parts to the worst of our enemies
1300748 this is not only a political failure but it also jeopardizes our security it is a fundamental moral failure in the national jewish and religious sense
1300749 jerusalem was destroyed a number of times taken away from our nation conquered but the jewish nation has never abandoned the city it fought for it time and time again jews throughout the generations were scattered all over in this and that ghetto and recited the words next year in jerusalem the israeli nation has never given up on its capital
1300750 in order to preserve our country and first and foremost jerusalem
1300751 i am willing to die for this and im certain you are as well this faith and devotion will be upheld forever hold your heads high be proud of our tradition and safeguard jerusalem
1300752 netanyahu incited against slain prime minister yitzhak rabin then against president shimon peres and defense minister ehud barak and now he is inciting against olmert and kadima
1300753 he knows full well that the issue of jerusalem was never raised in the negotiations with the palestinians
1300754 if you want to see reasoned analysis at its best you have to read the paragraph farmer
1300755 my friend patrick ohannigan shows why he is the jimi hendrix of pundits
1300756 frankly i think patrick ohannigan ought to be out there making a bazillion dollars from his writing
1300757 without a doubt these are the best facilities weve been given to run the olympics
1300758 the main thing with the olympics is to show people that we exist
1300759 high migration to the urban centers has resulted in a demand for education employment health and social services that far exceeds the capacity of the economy current infrastructure and institutions to deliver
1300760 presence of sports in communities is a great deterrent from destructive behavior and the crime rate is drastically reduced
1300761 i guess its o k in certain circumstances like when its a small country
1300762 i think it would be better if they actually qualified to show they were right for it
1300763 i hope in forty years time whoever is taking the lead plays that semi quaver exactly on the beat and doesnt use his her interpretation to improve the quality of my chart

1300766 from a scientific perspective green carbon accounting and protection of the natural forests in all nations should become part of a comprehensive approach to solving the climate change problem
1300767 protecting the carbon in australias and the worlds natural forests is no longer an option it is a necessity
1300768 if natural forests continue to be cleared and degraded then the carbon dioxide released will significantly increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
1300769 to date in climate change discussions in the forest sector all the attention has been on reforestation and afforestation
1300770 at the bali climate change conference in december everybody kind of woke up and realised that natural forests store a vast amount of carbon and that we cant afford to allow further emissions from deforestation and forest degeneration because these are on top of fossil fuel burning
1300771 i am going to nairofi to rook for a real woman
1300772 dont to you know the radies without blood on their lips nthis days have internet
1300773 the message delivered today is not irans response to the six countries
1300774 given the equipment our armed forces have an indefinite blockade of the strait of hormuz would be very easy
1300775 they also emphasised that preserving this path talks needs a positive and constructive atmosphere
1300776 if we dont get an encouraging response from the iranians we will have to show firmness resort to sanctions as in the past
1300777 should texas execute mr medellin before congress has a reasonable opportunity to convert the icj judgment into a justifiable federal right the state of texas will forever deprive mr medellin of his constitutionally protected right not to be deprived of his life without a due process of law
1300778 to ensure that its judgment has its intended effect of guiding the political branches to a constitutionally permissible method of complying with the nations treaty obligations
1300779 executing jose medellin in violation of an order by the world court would be a major step backward for the rule of law
1300780 if the united states ignores its legal obligations in this case it will be tough to argue that other countries should respect the rights of us citizens
1300781 i dont think weve ever doubted that we can handle them
1300782 weve just been off our game against a team like melbourne you cant be off ten or twenty per cent
1300783 youve really got to be there in every aspect of the game individually and as a team
1300784 if you dont then theyll make you pay its really clear that weve got to prepare well
1300785 its not a season defining game for either side but its certainly a game that we want to win in front of what i think will be one of the biggest crowds well see at brooky for quite a while
1300786 its a big clash its top of the table its on a friday night and its at brookie it doesnt get any bigger really
1300787 we havent been happy the last couple of weeks weve been putting probably 50 or 60 minutes together but really lacking in the last 20 thats pretty much the main focus to play the full 80
1300788 i think against the storm youve really got to be a disciplined footy team and youve got to be ready to grind it out
1300789 we went into the heart of africa self invited therein lies our fault
1300790 by the time of my court hearing my legs had completely seized up crying from the pain and weak from hunger
1300791 whats startling to us is as we get to a point where we feel weve addressed a specific complaint and a specific issue we identify additional issues

1300811 de vloek van het kaste systeem is niet alleen de onaanraakbaarheid en de consequente vergoddelijking van vuiligheid de vloek in een india dat probeert te groeien is vaak de totale gehoorzaamheid die het oplegt de kant en klare bevrediging de vermindering van de lust tot avontuur de verdringing van de mensen met persoonlijkheid de onmogelijkheid om uit te blinken

1300819 the performance is adequate up through iso 400 at iso 100 the detail is of course the best shifting up to iso 200 still shows good detail although i perceive it as slightly warmer overall personally i would use iso 200 and iso 400 interchangeably depending on available light
1300820 the good capable of excellent photos outdoors in good light compact and comfortable the bad no semimanual exposure modes lens distortion no zooming during movie capture poor high iso noise profile so so auto white balance indoors
1300821 camera performance was generally very good the sd790 starts up very quickly with a delay of just 0 8 seconds focusing performance was good including in low light where focus lock takes roughly one second i didnt find shutter lag to be an issue
1300822 the camera features a good video mode it records vga videos at 30fps with sound as avi files and using the optical image stabilisation videos appear very smooth and shake free
1300823 this is a high quality video compression that greatly reduces file size while keeping a high level of quality the videos run very smoothly with no compression artifacting when shooting in uhq quality the casio exilim ex z80 is a stylish and incredibly easy to use we consider this a good buy
1300824 the camera breaks no new ground in its class the lens focal range is average as is iso sensitivity performance shutter performance is good but not spectacular image and color quality are good and the ex z80 does stand out somewhat from the pack in affording the user a nice palette of image quality adjustments when shooting in auto mode

1300835 also ive watched look whos talking and look whos talking too id be worried if the baby sounded like bruce willis
1300836 the best advice my dad has given me was go with your gut and he said you cant really have expectations if i have expectations that hes going to be a rock star im sure hell come out being into sports and if i have expectations that hell be into sports then hell be into math or something
1300837 aint it awful if those little girls slept with as many men as they say in the tabloids why their little butts would have more fingerprints than the fbi

1300845 theyre trying to take my house away for a parking violation
1300846 i know it was my own fault for letting it drag on ive been under mental duress i havent been able to handle this
1300847 but on the other hand the city has to enforce its zoning laws i dont fault the city for that
1300848 its a shame someone didnt intervene to help him it would be nice if someone who worked for government would take the time and say lets look at this and see if were doing the right thing it would be nice if they would remember the human factor here
1300849 if you were a criminal wed take care of the whole problem for you get you an attorney

1300855 hot temper and intense patriotism are part of his scots irish heritage
1300856 it appears to be more difficult for a north of irelander to allow an honest difference of opinion in an opponent so that he is apt to regard the terms opponent and enemy as synonymous
1300857 there is enough of the scots irishman in mccain to make me nervous about how he would behave as president
1300858 when they tried to make him a pacifist fight in the war
1300859 our tour bus took us past rows of elegant houses with well kept gardens as well as the more industrialised areas like the docklands and the famous harland amp wolff shipyard these days they only refurbish oil rigs but in their heyday they built some of the worlds great liners among them of course the titanic our guide said it might seem odd that belfast is so proud of the titanic given its fate but as she put it it was allright when it left here
1300860 we showed the worth of our team and our drivers but lacked vital reliability
1300861 we will have to push very hard these next three weeks in the factory in terms of the cars development and reliability
1300862 what knowledge and skills have i acquired as a result of participating in this course
1300863 this week began with reading about the things i should know about blogs i learned when where and why to use them and also the positive and negative effects they can have the only negative being that sometimes they can be inaccurate and biased therefore you have to be careful if you are using them as sources of information the second article i read informed me that this is a digital world and the read write web has exploded in this day and age it is very important to connect to students in this way otherwise they will far surpass us if we refuse change in the articles that contain information about netiquette hoaxes e mail privacy and acronyms i realized that the web is a whole other atmosphere that i have yet to discover although i was aware of some the information i was still surprised by the other in the articles about discussion lists i realized that there are other ways to communicate and receive information about topics that interest you and its as easy as signing up to that particular list of interest in the articles that contained information about the world wide web i became more aware and gained a greater respect for those who maintain websites
1300864 this week i learned what a wiki and collaborative editing is how to use it who is using it why it is significant the downsides of both where it is going in the future and the implications for teaching and learning
1300865 by starting the week off with the online classroom i learned how to function in an atmosphere such as that it taught me to log in properly use different functions to make the classroom more user friendly to take turns and most importantly it answered questions i had based on the ones that i had asked as well as the ones that my classmates asked i learned from our guest speaker katie that being an slp takes a lot of work and creativity as well as lots of knowledge

1300868 from a scientific perspective green carbon accounting and protection of the natural forests in all nations should become part of a comprehensive approach to solving the
1300869 protecting the carbon in australias and the worlds natural forests is no longer an option it is a necessity
1300870 if natural forests continue to be cleared and degraded then the carbon dioxide released will significantly increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
1300871 to date in climate change discussions in the forest sector all the attention has been on reforestation and afforestation
1300872 at the bali climate change conference in december everybody kind of woke up and realised that natural forests store a vast amount of carbon and that we cant afford to allow further emissions from deforestation and forest degeneration because these are on top of fossil fuel burning

1300940 its easy to envision a wii 2 in a couple of years that runs at full hd and has both a wii mote and an analog controller so that all games can be ported to it
1300941 if nintendo were to introduce such a device it would be fully comparable to the xbox 360 perhaps it wouldnt have blu ray so a comparison to the ps3 may be unfair and would likely have most of the same third party content as the other two devices
1300942 a little concerned about the creative depth of the wii pool
1300943 will start to look really dated in a couple years when developers get more value from the 360 and learn more and more about the playstation 3
1300944 i cant begin to imagine what is on the drawing board for the wii but i can say that most developers ive spoken with are extremely excited about the potential for the console i believe that weve only just scratched the surface
1300945 tough choices about not including high definition capability at the start

1300957 government of ghana undertakes to fund gt from time to time for the social costs and other liabilities incurred in connection with the employment restructuring programme of the enlarged gt group
1300958 30 million in the national communication backbone company and the 55 5 million in the volta river authoritys fibre optic known as voltacom
1300959 in any case the minister stated the government valued ghana telecom at 1 286 billion and it was only vodafone that offered 70 per cent of that value
1300960 over the next 5 years vodafone expects ghana telecom to invest over us 500 million in its operations and network restoring and expanding network coverage and completing and integrating the fibre backbone
1300961 the parties recognise the importance to ghana of the expansion of the fibre backbone and following completion of the fibre transfer confirm that the parties are committed to the expansion of the fibre backbone by fibreco within a reasonable timeframe

1300965 you have to pay 3rd parties for extra widgets that makes absolutely no sense to me visual studio and the windows api provide me all the widgets i could want delphi developers like to make their own widgets and sell them to each other
1300966 you can only write delphi code using rad which costs money to own
1300967 there are properties and objects that are completely hidden from the developer and the only way to access them is through rads wysiwyg editor

1300976 you see the saftey at 15 yards hes not coming when hes 6 yards away that means hes coming
1300977 when you see us moving our arms around that means were talking
1300978 that was probably about 94 that we stopped using salt tablets
1300979 some people just mis took them more was not necessarily better
1300980 the water in the body was attracted to the stomach to dilute the salt so the fluids were not getting into the outer part of the body
1300981 it took a while last year it was a couple of weeks before we found out what we could do but now we already know what were capable of and we know what everyone is saying
1300982 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1300983 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact
1300984 rampant habitat loss exacerbated by hunting for food and to supply the wildlife trade in traditional chinese medicine and pets
1300985 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1300986 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change
1300987 the north koreans have 11 000 artillery tubes and rockets aimed at the south korean capital so any little thing that we do with north korea makes the south koreans very jittery
1300988 on the other hand the u s has to worry a great deal about where terrorists might get nuclear weapons or nuclear material
1300989 the more ive seen the more critical i see the need is for the world to pay attention to the people of burma and for the world to put pressure on the military regime
1300990 i think its best for u s chinas relations that i go i know its important for me to send a clear signal to the chinese people that we respect them
1300991 he will have to say something public which is always tricky how much he spotlights these issues
1300992 and i think he will not do it in an adversarial way
1300993 the air is a serious concern for all the athletes going over there
1300994 you try to find as many natural ways to help as you can
1300995 will we have an edge over other countries that dont wear anything over their mouths perhaps obviously we want to do all that we can to put our athletes in a position to win medals
1300996 id wager times and distance events will be well under previous olympics and that will be proof right there
1300997 youll hear more horror stories when these people who are trying to compete go out there and have trouble and say i just couldnt do it
1300998 you cant get oxygen to the working muscles so it would certainly affect their exercise performance
1300999 some companies are holding over their personnel and telling others to come in later
1301000 we havent had any problems with the rains so far
1301001 were monitoring the underpasses we want people to avoid driving into standing water they dont know how deep it is or if a manhole cover might have been removed
1301002 im looking to do something different that the sport has never seen
1301003 i am very excited to be here i just want to get to the pool and start swimming a little bit
1301004 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1301005 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1301006 if he is i might go see him when im done here

1301011 there is no doubt that the final of the euro 2012 championship will take place in ukraine
1301012 no one is going to take it away and any such talk is sheer gossip but our people are such that we need time for reflection and i would say that this time is up
1301013 el protagonista de la serie michael scofield viajar a venezuela para escapar de sus persecutores pero entonces descubrir que su primo jaimito garc a est encarcelado por violar la ley seca durante semana santa

1301015 i suspect it was their choice you would have to talk to them as to what prompted them to do this i will say this i am not a scientist but in my view that was unnecessary
1301016 i thought i was 80 percent sure i would be doubling now im 100 percent
1301017 but the 200 is closer to my heart and the 100 is a factor of me not wanting to do the 400 metres really
1301018 the training for the 400 is too hard im not lazy though i used to be
1301019 in this day and age loyalties are lacking in sport and often money talks too loudly
1301020 i think when it comes to issues like that there are certain traditions that need to be followed in sport and the ioc should have ensured this didnt happen
1301021 the last time we got our quota places qualification just a few months before the games but this time around everybody got it at least two years in advance
1301022 weve been together many times and ive not seen anyone mentally tougher
1301023 if we hadnt had that kind of experience we wouldnt be involved in this project
1301024 we definitely had to have credentials they were insistent on that
1301025 we are not going to annul the executive board decision before the games the rule stands
1301026 i would not want to see anyone who cheated in doping in any games but i think we could be in trouble
1301027 one of the reasons we think that we can stand up to any challenges is that it is not a question of a sanction
1301028 wir haben einen maestro gewollt aber er hat sich nicht einmal als dirigent erwiesen
1301029 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1301030 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1301031 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1301032 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1301033 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1301034 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1301035 his voice was clear even though marco starts feeling pain at his lower limbs
1301036 anyway i can walk and i want to descend to the base camp
1301037 the armys pilots are still waiting for an improvement in the weather conditions and the moment they were allowed to fly they will pick up the italian mountaineer
1301038 everything was going well to camp four and on summit attempt everything went wrong
1301039 are holding up well and are very proud of gers achievement and are still in total shock in relation to the fact that he may not be coming back
1301040 at high altitude at over 8 000 meters 26 250 feet it is too dangerous to mount a rescue to have the bodies returned
1301041 es ist sicher hart f r lars so knapp vor dem ziel auf das er konsequent hingearbeitet hatte noch auszufallen er hat in der vorbereitung riesenfortschritte gemacht und ich war sehr gespannt wie er sich nach seinem formanstieg gegen die besten handballer der welt behauptet h tte
1301042 there is a younger generation who dont want to dope there has been a shift and a change of culture
1301043 one difference is that the riders are starting to self police and it is becoming unacceptable they are starting to point the finger at people that is quite a change from decades ago when doping was almost the norm
1301044 without a doubt there has been an impact the more tests there are the better we encourage that and anything we that can do to keep that going through these games and carrying on from there we will support it
1301045 our sport has its issues and we cant get away from that so the more tests we can do for cyclists and the more people who are caught the better
1301046 we know across the board exactly where we are at and we know where the opposition is and what sort of times we are looking to ride rather than work on medals which are kind of out of our control we work on specific times if we achieve those that is our success and if we achieve those times i am fairly confident we can move on from where we were in athens

1301048 he has magic and is capable of anything on a football pitch
1301049 his quality is amazing it would be great if he joined us and hed be made very welcome here
1301050 the first rule for winning football is to make sure we play well but for all that well try to play good exciting football our opponents are always going to be trying to stop us from doing that
1301051 sometimes the games wont be as spectacular as wed like
1301052 since i was a young girl i always dreamed of being world champion
1301053 had clay pigeon been an olympic sport i would have had olympic dreams too now im trying to make up for lost time
1301054 shooting is more a matter of concentration than a matter of sight it would be more difficult should i shoot at still targets
1301055 im a just a little bit disturbed when skeets come from the left
1301056 but otherwise im more disturbed in everyday life because i dont have the peripheral vision
1301057 he gave me strength and convinced me i could make it
1301058 he does the same work as everyone else puts it in on the runs and hes got a lot of heart

1301065 es ist aber doch ursprung jeder partei im wahlkampf stimmen zu suchen
1301066 dadurch hatten wir etwas zeit zusammen mit den anderen rettungskr ften den einsatz vorzubereiten
1301067 alles lief sehr pr zise und ruhig ab auch drei rztekollegen von der insel kamen zur unterst tzung

1301071 the largest land acquisition agreement the city had reached so far in its attempt to remake point is in danger of falling apart the economic development corp has run into problems with the site in college point where it planned to relocate bros inc salvage an auto parts business that sprawls across 52 000 square feet according to one of the salvage yards owners
1301072 eminent domain remains perhaps the largest obstacle to the city gaining approval for the project a majority of city council members signed a letter opposing the redevelopment in large part due to the s insistence on using eminent domain if all other efforts fail and while the project has successfully passed through the first two steps of the land use review process it has not done so without criticism in approving the citys plan both queens community board 7 and queens borough president helen marshall expressed concern over eminent domain

1301076 what were seeing here is a clear pattern of repeated violations of patient medical records and patient confidentiality by ucla
1301077 whats startling to us is as we get to a point where we feel weve addressed a specific complaint and a specific issue we identify additional issues
1301078 ucla should have detected the violations by ms jackson years ago and should have immediately initiated the process to dismiss her
1301079 all other employees who were found to have violated patient confidentiality during our review have been disciplined including some who have been terminated
1301080 on behalf of the entire leadership of the ucla health system i am deeply sorry for this failure and the personal distress these breaches may have caused
1301081 californians have every right to expect their medical records to be safeguarded and protected and i am alarmed about repeated violations of patient confidentiality and the potential harm to the citizens of this state
1301082 by putting financial penalties in place for those employees and facilities that do not follow these laws this legislation will lead to better care for all californians
1301083 we dont mind john mccain going after us if he sticks to the facts
1301084 but we are sick of the distortions about our record
1301085 both of us strongly favor off shore drilling to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1301086 it has the potential to give farmers a much finer control of pastures finer management of where animals are and a better use of the land
1301087 with this technology we can also find out what the animals do all day
1301088 with virtual fencing you would have the ability in real time to manage the animals across the landscape to avoid that situation
1301089 if there are areas that are overused you could move an animal off those areas more rapidly
1301090 virtual fencing could take all this labor included with removing physical mundane barriers and focus more on management
1301091 its looking for the best management with the best skills that technology can provide
1301092 if you try to get them to move from point a to point b and you dont understand their behavior youre less likely to have success
1301093 the sun certification exam was certainly no walk in the park but kathys material allowed me to not only pass the exam but ace it

1301111 the police are empowered to immediately arrest shopkeepers if they find any gta grand theft auto games on sale
1301112 gta is banned mainly because of its obscene content under the criminal law article 287 that prohibits reproduction distribution or possession of such material
1301113 we have stopped selling grand theft auto and inform all legal vendors to withdraw the game from their shelves
1301114 the company will not import gta 4 the next in the series to distribute in thailand
1301115 we spend money to come here with our families its an inexpensive place to stay

1301118 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1301119 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1301120 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1301121 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1301122 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1301123 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world

1301130 stasi and normannenstrasse theyre one and the same for east germans
1301131 were dealing with the stasi issue both satirically but also seriously
1301132 back then i thought it was all terrible now i laugh about it
1301133 many people still tremble when they think about the stasi are afflicted with sleeping disorders and still suffer physically
1301134 in germany we are slowly returning to a monitored state and if things continue this way we will soon have a stasi situation again

1301162 gta ist definitiv unser gr ter konkurrent aber ich habe im internet schon kommentare gelesen die sagten dass gta 4 zu realistisch geworden sei und dadurch viel spielspa verloren gehe vor allem im vergleich zu san andreas san andreas ist genauso wie vice city eines meiner lieblingsspiele bis auf diese komischen aktivit ten rockstar hat gta 4 langsamer gemacht sie haben es realistisch gemacht es ist eine atemberaubende umgebung geworden aber sie haben dabei den spielspa faktor vergessen der multiplayer modus h lt gta 4 am leben es gibt zwar immer noch die auftragskiller missionen aber ansonsten ist der wiederspielwert eher gering
1301163 das ist der grund warum wir den koop modus all die verschiedenen missionen die abwechslung und so weiter eingebaut haben

1301165 we believe that this move if happens will not have any significant impact on profitability of domestic soda ash manufacturers like tata chemicals ghcl dcw and nirma since india is a net importer of soda ash and revenues from exports do not contribute a substantial share to these companies
1301166 the new spot exchange will offer electronic trading in agricultural products and we feel that would bring greater transparency risk management capability and price discovery in commodity markets in india
1301167 electronic spot trading will unlock unprecedented value through benefits from better prices transparent trading guaranteed trades better warehousing and logistics and lower marketing costs for farmers traders and consumers
1301168 we plan to reach out to all the 7 500 agricultural produce marketing committees apmcs across the country over the next one year
1301169 interest in derivatives is certainly gaining ground in the region as evidenced by the growing trade on dgcx
1301170 growth has also been supported by the recent introduction of crude oil futures which has attracted substantial interest from the region and beyond
1301171 we were trying to do something we felt was good here but now we may just have to come up with a new plan
1301172 people seem to think were staking out homes to build a subdivision in the middle of a swamp thats just not the case
1301173 there have never been more platforms with which you need to work understanding the visual integrity of an idea is vital and that needs someone who understands and articulates a visual point of view its not a different mindset now you still have to be informed and understand whos out there and whos doing what with a diverse advertising landscape youve got to do all of it but do all of it well you need a point of development and that still means having someone who under stands type and illustration
1301174 but its the art direction of clich and predict ability
1301175 they know we can turn it around in an afternoon theres no more magic in art directors and a lot of people think they can do it themselves because they have some programme on their computer
1301176 no mystery exists anymore the vast choice of typefaces is available to everyone the blowing up and down of logos and type is simple and the arrangement of layout and photography can be manipulated at will when the client utters the words can you just blow up my logo by 10 they are not only starting a dialogue they think they understand but are sending art directors to early graves their ignorance must be stopped
1301177 so we need to be able to explain to account people and clients why we need more time then they will be on our side expecting something brilliant we also need to be able to articulate the huge benefits of work that visually stands out i once presented some distinctive layouts to a client a room full of clients actually the silence was excruciating they were shocked even though the agency had done its best to manage their expect ations and prepare them for some interesting work finally the head client said isnt that a little risky my response was this whats risky is running work that looks just like your competitors work better to run something that is distinctive memorable and ownable the ads ran and six months later the client was very happy
1301178 for d amp ad i run an art direction workshop with paul belford and we spend the first hour just defining art direction
1301179 it means different things to different people unfortunately clients see it as just look and feel the bit that dresses up the strategy but in an image based culture like ours it can be the most important factor in producing ads that have a real resonance
1301180 the interesting thing that emerged in the sessions was how grateful the creatives of any level were to be reminded of simply the most obvious art directional rules
1301181 what you want is a group of people who are all experts in their fields the worst thing is to have a group of generalists you need the moments of conflict its these that create invention
1301182 with digital its a lot more collaborative we dont have a standard agency structure to adhere to
1301183 a lot of digital agencies dont have traditional copywriter art director teams many dont have separate departments whats common to all is that techno logists motion graphic experts designers and copywriters all work together a really fantastic idea might come out of a brilliant bit of technology as much as from an advertising idea in the trad itional sense in digital as in all media an idea is the most important thing but at glue we do beautiful well crafted work and thats also what clients come to us for
1301184 people dislike ads they screen them out because as we all know the overwhelming majority of ads are so awful our real job is to dramatise the benefits of a product or service in a way that the target market notices likes and remembers to do this we clearly need great strategies and ideas but we also need great execution the execution should involve doing something to make what we do not look like an ad
1301185 the cd they sent was accompanied by no credentials there was no promo sheet name dropping the famous djs who are playing their music no pretentious cv stating who plays what and who used to play with whoever no info no blurb and no gumph in other words they just sent me a plain cd which was refreshing because at the end of the day all that matters is whether its any good or not right

1301254 we tested six brave guys in the bar to see how much they smell on different parts of their bodies dr hirsch sniffed ever so scientifically their underarms stomach back and head
1301255 we had some songs but there were only about three and mark ronson wanted to work with us
1301256 we met up with him he sounds he was a funny guy and he got he had the same sort of sense of humour and we thought lets go in the studio with him and record and the recording sounded fantastic
1301257 indie bands are big so a lot of record companies are pushing indie bands and going weve got one and they dress in vests

1301260 the euro zone retail sales figures for june are the latest in a string of very weak economic data that will strengthen the hand of the doves on the ecbs governing council in blocking calls for further monetary policy tightening
1301261 we have found the mother lode of western lowland gorillas
1301262 we had no idea that these great densities that is numbers per square kilometer of the gorillas were possible in central congo
1301263 diseases led by but not limited to the ebola virus have created big empty holes in the forest where gorillas used to be but are no longer
1301264 we call it the green abyss because you go into it and its a world unto itself
1301265 these swamp environments are extremely difficult to get along in
1301266 theres literally no place to pitch a tent and sleep
1301267 where there are natural resources in africa the rush to exploit them is at a pace that no one ever dreamt possible
1301268 its horrific frankly and the value of this announcement of this large population is hopefully people will realize that this is a chance to get there before the other guys do
1301269 ebola has resulted in dramatic local declines in gorilla populations in congo and gabon in the last two decades with population crashes of more than 95 percent being recorded
1301270 given the long life spans and slow reproductive cycles of great apes recent estimates suggest it may take up to 120 years to recover from population crashes of this magnitude
1301271 these important gorilla populations of 125 000 individuals are adjacent to areas that are known to have been impacted by ebola outbreaks in recent years
1301272 anak muda sekarang dianggap buruk oleh orang tua saya malah sebaliknya mengapresiasi generasi sekarang anak muda sekarang dituduh tidak menghargai perjuangan 1957 saya pikir ini bagus cukuplah generasi tua saja yang merasakan kesengsaraan masa itu mengapa generasi muda dipaksa merasakannya juga itu bukan tujuan kemerdekaan kalau anak muda melupakan perjuangan itu bagus
1301273 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact
1301274 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1301275 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date

1301278 the external environment has deteriorated and the consequences of this for northern rock are increased credit losses
1301279 while the losses reported today are likely to continue as the restructuring proceeds and as the credit environment remains difficult i am confident that the foundations have been well laid for recovery and return in due course to private ownership

1301287 any coach in fayette county needs to be careful in taking any benefit from the booster clubs
1301288 fayette county hands off control and responsibility solely to the booster clubs and booster clubs are the direct results of fayette county deciding not to fund extracurricular activities
1301289 what we have is a train wreck where there is no oversight
1301290 we have guidelines that we expect to be followed and along with the guidelines we have a code of ethics
1301291 anybody who follows those guidelines is not going to have a problem
1301292 was never notified or asked to go to a training
1301293 but when a group of parents has an issue with playing time or positions parents can exhibit a tremendous amount of control
1301294 the whole situation of how the school district funds extracurricular activities needs to be reviewed
1301295 the booster club parents are very careful that any request from a coach is bona fide
1301296 are very clear on what can and cant be done
1301297 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1301298 this is a very respectful campaign i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
1301299 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1301300 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1301301 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1301302 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1301303 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1301304 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1301305 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another

1301310 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1301311 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1301312 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1301313 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1301314 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1301315 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1301316 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence

1301328 the message delivered today is not irans response to the six countries
1301329 given the equipment our armed forces have an indefinite blockade of the strait of hormuz would be very easy
1301330 they also emphasised that preserving this path talks needs a positive and constructive atmosphere

1301374 it just seemed to me that whatever other personnel actions were going to be taken would have been taken at that time
1301375 the department of human services thats characterized in the grand jury report is from 2006
1301376 there is not a shadow of doubt in my mind that this department will turn around
1301377 despite the exceptional nature of danieals situation not one supervisor gave her case extra attention or offered any guidance to laura sommerer
1301378 those responsible for checking on her safety seemed to think she must be fine as long as she was alive even if she was sitting alone in a stroller in a dark room all day wasting away
1301379 the actions or inactions of these supervisors might arguably be considered criminal
1301380 the grand jury has decided however to focus its criminal charges on those individuals who were most directly involved in danieals neglect and death
1301381 a share of the stain of responsibility for danieals death remains on their hands
1301382 the five biggest traps to avoid when leading a diverse team
1301383 who can suggest something totally radical to what weve done in the past
1301384 we all need an understanding of contextin order to problem solve
1301385 grind to a halt because of their failure to produce the hoped for results
1301386 this failure to sustain significant change recurs again and again despite substantial resources ommitted to the change effort many are bankrolled by top management talented and committed people
1301387 the most general lesson to be learned from the more successful cases is that the change process goes through a series of phases that in total usually require a considerable length of time skipping steps creates only the illusion of speed and never produces satisfactory results
1301388 making critical mistakes in any of the phases can have a devastating impact slowing momentum and negating hard won gains
1301389 without motivation people wont help and the effort goes nowhere executives underestimate how hard it can be to drive people out of their comfort zones
1301390 a picture of the future that is relatively easy to communicate and appeals to customers stockholders and employees a vision helps clarify the direction in which an organization needs to move
1301391 a useful rule of thumb if you cant communicate the vision to someone in five minutes or less and get a reaction that signifies both understanding and interest you are not yet done with this phase of the transformation process
1301392 when it becomes clear to people that major change will take a long time urgency levels can drop commitments to produce short term wins help keep the urgency level up and force detailed analytical thinking that can clarify or revise visions
1301393 until new behaviours are rooted in social norms and shared values they are subject to degradations as soon as the pressure for change is removed
1301394 there are still more mistakes that people make but these eight are the big ones in reality even successful change efforts are messy and full of surprises
1301395 when i first got the call i was made up at the thought of coming back to blackburn because i had so many happy times
1301396 i had six enjoyable years at blackburn some of the best years of my playing career were spent at ewood park
1301397 so when the opportunity came around to come back i had no hesitation in saying yes its a massive thing for me to be here
1301398 the premier league is the big thing for me ive been at wolves for almost eight years and we flirted with the premier league for just one year
1301399 on top of that with it being a club that i played for and one that i really enjoyed my time with the opportunity was just too good to resist
1301400 part of the reason ive come back to the club is because of the fans
1301401 ive also still got friends in the area and theres one or two people at the club that are still here from my time playing at blackburn
1301402 its a new start for everyone here theres new staff and its a new beginning for the club we cant wait for the season to start
1301403 we had three really good goalkeepers at wolves any club would be pleased to have them on their books
1301404 ive got many good memories at wolves and when you have been at a club for so long its obviously wrench to leave
1301405 but equally the opportunity to go back to blackburn was so strong
1301406 paul is a top class goalkeeper and hopefully he is going to take it up where brad friedel left off
1301407 tragically illustrates how important our prompt and responsive involvement is to our citys children as i previously advised you continued failure to provide timely services or otherwise follow departmental policy or supervisory instruction will result in additional discipline up to and including termination of your employment
1301408 to fail to close and or transfer cases in a timely manner and this puts children at risk this failure to move your cases deprives children and families of the services that they desperately need
1301409 the dhs of 2008 is not the dhs of 2006
1301410 but all i heard was a horn and i turned around and she was on the ground
1301411 he was in the street with her and he just kept saying why wont you talk to me
1301412 you could hear her come screaming from a mile away
1301413 she would show up last year to every wrestling game to support her boyfriend even though he was out with an injury most of the season
1301414 youll be my first friend i met sic in heaven
1301415 if you are not prepared to take the action that needs to be taken if you cannot keep up and stay on top of things then you should leave this city government right now
1301416 the behavior exhibited by public employees is unacceptable i am furious at their actions
1301417 policies and procedures thats slightly abstract you had a real live person here who needed love and needed support and adults failed this person badly
1301418 this is serious work the fate of a child or a family could be in your hands
1301419 thats not to be taken lightly its not to be pushed over to the side its not to put papers in files some place and think the problem is going away
1301420 i had always felt that all things being equal probably the two biggest toughest hires were going to be police commissioner and dhs commissioner
1301421 it is so tragic it is so dehumanizing it is just astounding to me
1301422 ive just never read anything like that i hope to never read anything like that again
1301423 in later life it is men who come closer to achieving their aspirations are more satisfied with their family lives and financial situations and are the happier of the two
1301424 of course one doesnt have to be married to be happy but if thats something you really want and it is for most people then the failure to attain it can have an impact on your overall happiness
1301425 epidemiologic observations of sex differences in the onset and course of schizophrenia prompted exploration of oestrogens role in schizophrenia
1301426 oestrogen treatment is a promising new area for future treatment of schizophrenia and potentially for other severe mental illnesses
1301427 identified molecular mechanisms involved in the evolution of human cognitive abilities by combining biological data from two research directions evolutionary and medical
1301428 our new research suggests that schizophrenia is a byproduct of the increased metabolic demands brought about during human brain evolution
1301429 the discovery of lake deposits with perfectly preserved fossils of mosses diatoms and minute crustacea called ostracods is particularly exciting they are the first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the dry valleys since they were discovered during the first scott expedition in 1902 1903
1301430 the fossil finds allow us to examine antarctica as it existed just prior to climate cooling at 13 9 million years ago it is a unique window into the past to study deposits is akin to strolling across the dry valleys 14 1 million years ago
1301431 if we can understand how we got into this relatively cold climate phase then that can help predict how global warming might push us back out of this phase
1301432 for the vast majority of earth history there was no permanent ice like is common today at poles and even the tropics at high elevation

1301740 weve just been off our game against a team like melbourne you cant be off ten or twenty per cent
1301741 youve really got to be there in every aspect of the game individually and as a team
1301742 if you dont then theyll make you pay its really clear that weve got to prepare well
1301743 its not a season defining game for either side but its certainly a game that we want to win in front of what i think will be one of the biggest crowds well see at brooky for quite a while
1301744 its a big clash its top of the table its on a friday night and its at brookie it doesnt get any bigger really
1301745 we havent been happy the last couple of weeks weve been putting probably 50 or 60 minutes together but really lacking in the last 20 thats pretty much the main focus to play the full 80

1301754 should texas execute mr medellin before congress has a reasonable opportunity to convert the icj judgment into a justifiable federal right the state of texas will forever deprive mr medellin of his constitutionally protected right not to be deprived of his life without a due process of law
1301755 to ensure that its judgment has its intended effect of guiding the political branches to a constitutionally permissible method of complying with the nations treaty obligations
1301756 executing jose medellin in violation of an order by the world court would be a major step backward for the rule of law
1301757 if the united states ignores its legal obligations in this case it will be tough to argue that other countries should respect the rights of us citizens
1301758 from a scientific perspective green carbon accounting and protection of the natural forests in all nations should become part of a comprehensive approach to solving the climate change problem
1301759 protecting the carbon in australias and the worlds natural forests is no longer an option it is a necessity
1301760 if natural forests continue to be cleared and degraded then the carbon dioxide released will significantly increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
1301761 to date in climate change discussions in the forest sector all the attention has been on reforestation and afforestation
1301762 at the bali climate change conference in december everybody kind of woke up and realised that natural forests store a vast amount of carbon and that we cant afford to allow further emissions from deforestation and forest degeneration because these are on top of fossil fuel burning

1301766 if we dont get an encouraging response from the iranians we will have to show firmness resort to sanctions as in the past

1301826 bill does not have the funds to move this club forward
1301827 any individual or group which boasts integrity and financial clout
1301828 to suggest that everton football club will suddenly and dramatically open its arms to any would be investor or buyer should the destination kirkby project be given a governmental green light is totally mischievous and wholly misleading
1301829 self evidently any club which can boast a stadium which is modern fit for purpose and capable of expansion does represent a more attractive proposition to potential investors
1301830 logic therefore dictates that if we do find a new home efc would as the club which has finished inside the top six on three occasions in recent years be a more attractive proposition to investors
1301831 however to suggest that there is some sort of link between confirmation of a move to kirkby and the prospect of serious negotiations with would be suitors is totally wrong

1301846 belly dancing involved muscle movements and breathe control i realized that unlike other forms of dance art that involve leg movements belly dancing was more about muscle control especially around the hip stomach and the chest the subtle movements of the hips stomach and chest make your muscles flexible it also involves breathe control and is something very similar to pranayam i would say belly dancing is a wonderful form of exercise too in fact it has helped me cut down oodles of weight

1302050 i think its good for us to see their styles but i think for them to take up so many spots again and again denying spots to the talented players here is just wrong

1302060 we want to make sure were prepared for every option
1302061 we dont want war we want peace but we will not let that second holocaust take place
1302062 sanctions can be effective as long as the iranians and the entire world understand that all the options are on the table
1302063 this is what we need to do today we cannot postpone it we cannot wait for the iranians to decide whether they are willing to talk with the international community
1302064 the general consensus in israel is that engagement of iran the general consensus is that this is the wrong way to go
1302065 i dont think that anybody really does believe that theres a diplomatic solution
1302066 the iranians are well known for attrition and wearing down their opponents with never ending negotiations that can go on and on this is their strategy and has been their strategy forever
1302067 they entail upgrading the status of iran in the region and internationally if they accept the incentives then iran will be translated overnight from a country that is more or less isolated into one of the major forces in the region
1302068 iran is a country which is openly committed to destroying israel is committed to performing another holocaust
1302069 i think that whats happened in israel the third generation after the holocaust has sort of gone back to a holocaust mentality sense that yes this could happen again the statements coming from iran have exacerbated that feeling
1302070 israelis are despite their skepticism and pessimism i think they are hoping that maybe the americans will be able to pull the rabbit out of the hat to put it that way
1302071 if the united states through direct engagement can stop irans enrichment program i think that would get full support from jerusalem
1302072 we have found the mother lode of western lowland gorillas
1302073 we had no idea that these great densities that is numbers per square kilometer of the gorillas were possible in central congo
1302074 diseases led by but not limited to the ebola virus have created big empty holes in the forest where gorillas used to be but are no longer
1302075 we call it the green abyss because you go into it and its a world unto itself
1302076 these swamp environments are extremely difficult to get along in
1302077 theres literally no place to pitch a tent and sleep
1302078 where there are natural resources in africa the rush to exploit them is at a pace that no one ever dreamt possible
1302079 its horrific frankly and the value of this announcement of this large population is hopefully people will realize that this is a chance to get there before the other guys do
1302080 ebola has resulted in dramatic local declines in gorilla populations in congo and gabon in the last two decades with population crashes of more than 95 percent being recorded
1302081 given the long life spans and slow reproductive cycles of great apes recent estimates suggest it may take up to 120 years to recover from population crashes of this magnitude
1302082 these important gorilla populations of 125 000 individuals are adjacent to areas that are known to have been impacted by ebola outbreaks in recent years

1302084 in short and simple terms we would be plunged into a depression that would make the great depression of the 1930s in which i spent my childhood look like boom times
1302085 industries would fail banks would collapse government revenues would dry up universities would have to close health care even as limited as it now is for roughly 75 million americans would virtually cease in short something like what the south suffered at the end of the civil war would plague the country
1302086 even at todays price as you know 14 airlines have gone out of business while others are hovering on the brink of bankruptcy and most have curtailed service and laid off personnel
1302087 at double or triple todays price none could fly unless nationalized a whole range of other industries would be quickly drawn into the quicksand ironically war would push america into a form of socialist economy
1302088 so the lights are on late in washingtons federal reserve sec and treasury department trying to figure out how socialism your tax dollars and credits can once again bail out these big time gamblers with our money reckless self enriching capitalists get on your knees and thank the rescuing washington socialists for without them you would surely be in chains
1302089 the details are being worked out with the doctors this week but the tentative plan is for radiation and chemotherapy
1302090 a simple neurological examination seems to be an additional prognosticator of hard outcomes particularly death above and beyond other measures used in clinical practice
1302091 it is likely that the neurological examination might capture additional information about the integrity of the nervous system in apparently healthy older adults
1302092 all we need is a drummer for people who only need a beat

1302097 there is not one of us who is not deeply in debt to the banks we have even mortgaged our cattle in order to save our farms
1302098 the north koreans have 11 000 artillery tubes and rockets aimed at the south korean capital so any little thing that we do with north korea makes the south koreans very jittery
1302099 on the other hand the u s has to worry a great deal about where terrorists might get nuclear weapons or nuclear material
1302100 the more ive seen the more critical i see the need is for the world to pay attention to the people of burma and for the world to put pressure on the military regime
1302101 i think its best for u s chinas relations that i go i know its important for me to send a clear signal to the chinese people that we respect them
1302102 he will have to say something public which is always tricky how much he spotlights these issues
1302103 and i think he will not do it in an adversarial way
1302104 privacy is taken very very very seriously here its also pretty drummed in to our heads that this wouldnt even be something to joke about internally
1302105 nothing you do ever goes away and nothing you do ever escapes notice there isnt any privacy get over it
1302106 we have one game plan but there are pattern variations with which we can play around
1302107 if i want to change my game plan i will have to change the players
1302108 when you look at the skills of the players in the extended squad one comes to the conclusion that those who are on the field and those who are not are more or less the same
1302109 therefore the game plan wont change when someone is injured there may be a difference in physical attributes and speed but our style will remain more or less the same
1302110 that is where we will be working towards for the next four years
1302111 from what i saw in their match against italy they play just as argentina usually play
1302112 it was their first match under the new experimental laws but it seemed as if the laws were made to suit them
1302113 i think that while its appropriate for the police department to invite video reports of wrong doing both by ordinary people and police officers the new york police department has a long way to go to ensure that police officers who engage in wrongdoing like what was captured in the two video tapes that were recently disclosed are held accountable
1302114 de tros heeft een lange geschiedenis op het gebied van muziekprogrammas wie herinnert zich niet op volle toeren en het schlagerfestival programmas die jarenlang door heel nederland bekeken werden ook vandaag halen de muziekprogrammas van de tros nog hoge kijkcijfers we kunnen er alleen maar trots op zijn dat het volledig door ons gemaakte programma nu op prime time door de tros wordt uitgezonden
1302115 we hebben elke week minstens n limburgse artiest erbij zo kan het zomaar gebeuren dat de rest van nederland ook kennis maakt met artiesten als big benny frans theunisz en de limburgse sterren van morgen
1302116 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1302117 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1302118 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
1302119 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
1302120 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
1302121 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
1302122 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
1302123 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
1302124 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
1302125 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
1302126 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
1302127 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
1302128 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
1302129 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
1302130 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
1302131 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
1302132 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
1302133 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
1302134 ik kan niet wachten om het nummer live in het gelredome te horen
1302135 its a fantastic opportunity for us at a time when a lot of our competitors are scaling down because of difficulties accessing their balance sheet
1302136 last year many private equity players were clamouring for exposure in india and china but it was hard to get in
1302137 now sellers expectations have come down and what theyre asking for is much more reasonable but the private equity and hedge funds have really pulled back and are more cautious

1302141 dan apabila hamba ku bertanya mengenai aku maka jawablah sesungguhnya aku dekat aku memakbulkan permohonan orang yang berdoa apabila dia meminta kepada ku
1302142 jika allah mencintai seorang hamba maka ia berfirman wahai jibril sesungguhnya aku mencintai si polan maka cintailah dia
1302143 katakanlah wahai hamba ku yang melampaui batas terhadap diri mereka sendiri jangan kamu berputus asa daripada rahmat allah sesungguhnya allah mengampuni dosa semuanya sesungguhnya dia maha pengampun lagi maha penyayang dan kembalilah kamu kepada tuhanmu dan berserah dirilah kepada nya sebelum datang azab kepadamu kemudian kamu tidak dapat ditolong lagi
1302144 demi tuhan yang diriku berada dalam genggaman nya seandainya kamu tidak berdosa nescaya allah akan mematikan kamu kemudian allah akan mendatangkan satu kaum yang melakukan dosa dan mereka memohon keampunan kepada allah lantas allah mengampuni mereka
1302145 tuhan kita turun ke langit dunia pada waktu malam tatkala tiba sepertiga malam yang akhir lalu berfirman siapakah yang berdoa kepada ku nescaya aku terima siapakah yang meminta kepada ku nescaya aku beri dan siapakah yang meminta ampun nescaya aku ampuni
1302146 aku tahu bila allah mencintaiku iaitu saat aku membenci segala kejahatanku

1302156 yourselves bwanat default en route to outdistance entry the chop
1302157 champion the provision of high quality nutritious food in the capital
1302158 rosie is bursting with great ideas on how we can boost the level of top notch food grown locally and support londons local independent food industries and smaller shops
1302159 there are many aspects of our current food system which are damaging our environment through wasteful practices and producing poor quality food
1302160 it simply does not need to be the case that londoners cannot have access to locally produced top quality food but we have to have a radical rethink to find ways of making this happen
1302161 first let me say that john remains all male theres no question about that secondly he hes hes as smart curious and intellectually alert as possible
1302162 the federation of poles in great britain has been concerned about newspaper coverage which has sought to emphasise negative aspects of the polish presence in the uk
1302163 in our view the worst examples linked poles with words and phrases like feckless chancers race riots swamp the nhs fears for schools cut price treatment push british graduates to back of the jobs queue killers drug smugglers and rapist we consider that this has made poles living in the uk feel vulnerable and persecuted
1302164 some might argue that these robust headlines were aimed more at the british government its immigration policy and at the european union fair enough
1302165 we maintain that poles have felt humiliated by the coverage and are vulnerable to numerous acts of overt hostility and even violence which they have experienced from a vociferous minority of uk citizens
1302166 there have been hundreds of cases of hate crime against poles in this country recorded in the last two years some leading to death or permanent injury and we would not want these incidents to be encouraged by potentially inflammatory newspaper stories or headlines
1302167 we came to a better understanding of each others position
1302168 we were never anti polish they just interpreted some of our headlines as that because they were written in our usual robust way
1302169 it is essential that women receive the right education and information so they understand the techniques of control frequently used by abusive men
1302170 once she recognises theres a problem she can do something about it the government spends very little on education campaigns on what is a major social problem domestic violence causes more deaths than cancer we can provide refuges but we cant stop the problem without education
1302171 in our report we said the government needs to look at more preventative measures in schools ed balls the secretary of state for children schools and families office has been quite receptive about our findings
1302172 what perpetrators do is make women feel like its their fault and its often a wearing down over a period of time women arent always aware that theres a pattern or recognise these problems so anything that alerts women is a good thing then at least you can be aware and equip yourself
1302173 we need more prevention rather than just picking up the pieces research says that it takes on average 35 beatings before a woman seeks help thats a long way down the road we need to start long before that
1302174 a period of silence on your part would now be most welcome
1302175 india needs more political will and needs to strengthen its healthcare delivery to the poorest of the poor who are not being reached

1302205 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1302206 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1302207 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1302208 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1302209 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1302210 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1302211 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence

1302214 i see similarities between the metal recycling sector today and the waste management industry in the 1980s the latter had to evolve rapidly from being insular and fragmented to being customer and service led and willing to move with the times the same dynamics are now infiltrating the metals recycling sector which give simon and i a great business building opportunity

1302232 the enquiry is making good progress and we are following up a number of lines of enquiry some significant thanks to the assistance we have received so far from the public
1302233 we believe todays operation may give added impetus to the enquiry as there may well be people in the area who were there around the same time last tuesday
1302234 they may have seen or heard something which they did not consider material at the time and we would hope to be able to jog their memory and elicit information which might prove to be significant
1302235 as is often the case in such enquiries something they might not have thought worth mentioning could turn out to be vital to our efforts in compiling a picture of the events which led up the attack on mr branigan and bringing to justice whoever was responsible for his death
1302236 it may well be that people have been away from aberdeen since last week and have been unaware of our appeals for information
1302237 i would urge anyone who may have information even second hand information which they have heard from someone else to let us know i can assure them their information will be treated in confidence
1302238 in view of the fact that the installation and configuration guide of phamm is lacking some basic information it took me quite some time including crying swearing getting depressed to put it all together and get it working long live google to find hints or explanations for problems and configuration issues piecing it all together wasnt simple so i would like to share how i configured it and got it all working toghether as i like but i think that it will benefit other users as well
1302239 molto importante che i militari escano finalmente dalle loro caserme e anziche vigilare le loro sole installazioni si mettano al servizio dei cittadini nellinteresse del paese e dei contribuenti
1302240 ci sono 150 000 militari delle 3 ff aa che se ne stanno chiusi dalla mattina alla sera nelle caserma senza essere molto occupati inventandosi il lavoro tra le varie caserme sembra che lavoriamo per noi stessi
1302241 per me una mossa propagandistica se avete letto con attenzione quanto riportato dal minsitro o dalla stampa limpiego dei militari sar a discrezione dei prefetti e delle forze di polizie ragazzi ma quando mai le ff pp hanno chiesto loro sponte il concorso dellesercito
1302242 sono perfettamente daccordo con chi ritiene che lesercito che uno strumento di guerra o tale dovrebbe essere non pu essere impiegato in un paese civile e democratico e sar solo una mossa propagandistica per buttare il solito fumo italiano negli occhi della gente al fine di accattivarsene le simpatie
1302243 da quante forze deve mettere sul campo per garantire la legalita
1302244 pensate che le forze di polizia siano daccordo con voi e vogliano il vs aiuto poveri illusi in primo luogo perch se cos fosse si ammeterebbe che la plizia o i cc o la guardia di finanza hanno fallito nel in secondo luogo far intervenire lsercito sul tema sicurezza significa togliere risorse al ministero dellinterno e in questo caso apriti cielo credete veramente che il min maroni o la russa si cederebbero lun con laltro risorse finanziarie per il pagamento degli straordinari ai militari ecc

1302255 not at this time but wed love to do it
1302256 i am going to predict once again that we will have a sea change i am really bullish honestly if i was going to start a linux business today it would be something on the desktop or a mobile device
1302257 the reason is that a laptop computer is going to be a couple of hundred bucks in a couple of years you are going to have fully functional laptops that are incredibly cheap intel and amd are building systems on a chip that is reducing the cost of building these kind of devices the highest cost items on these things is memory and storage so if you look at the world in the future of the 200 laptop linux is the only game in town
1302258 early successes will push microsoft to price compete but its not just the price that is going to make the difference but the fact that with linux you can tailor the experience for woman over 40 in asia for example
1302259 i think rather than embracing openness on the desktop side they will do the opposite they will retrench they will do anything to protect that microsoft office cash cow i mean that is their big monopoly in terms of really displaying monopoly price characteristics jesus that is an expensive suite of products
1302260 for me the biggest loser here is microsoft that is just a kick in the teeth for them i would not want to be in the windows mobile sales group now
1302261 the symbian move is a smart one but something they are going to have to overcome is that they are saddled with this old architecture that was designed for small handsets not for smartphones per se so they are a little more chained down and its going to take them some time to roll out the open platform get the governance model working get the foundation set up get the licences all cleared
1302262 it is going to be tough fight i think the android guys are going to come out with some really good handsets at christmas next year and i think google is extremely good at attracting new developers they have as buzz about them and a track record of developing killer development tools
1302263 the assumed reason for google to develop android is to keep that mobile computing world as open as possible so that companies like google can provide services paid search music downloads you name it and not have to go through an os vendor or a carrier nokia definitely has the same ambitions they want to be similar to apple when it comes to distributing music and entertainment and all these mobile vendors see that future and they all want to be there
1302264 well we support the kernel development effort and that is the one thing that all these developments have in common they all use the linux kernel so to the extent that we can provide forums to allow the groups to collaborate on technical issues at the core of their technology then we are out to do that as well as legal issues we have a forum for council from all these companies to come together to discuss the legal issues which has been a pretty popular forum for a lot of companies within the mobile linux and mobile industry in general
1302265 they seem to get some kind of bye you ever noticed that
1302266 but then the reality is that they just make killer products no one can argue that the iphone or the mac desktop experience is not a great experience

1302308 if we invest in our families and in ordinary americans by helping them go to college with tax cuts for 95 percent of families to reward them for hard work and give tax cuts to help them save for retirement such are the ways everyone can have a stake in our economy

1302343 speaker pelosi blocked their plan because it wont help lower gas prices but it will line the pockets of big oil executives the same people donating millions of dollars to republicans
1302344 but republicans are working hard to make it seem like theyre fighting for cash strapped commuters and not the oil companies who wrote their plan

1302544 aafia was tortured for five years until one day us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan which shows how they abused their power and tortured an innocent woman without committing any crime

1302588 morgan stanley alerta p blicamente sobre la situaci n de los bancos del pa s
1302589 morgan stanley banco inversor ha lanzado una importante alerta por la salud de los bancos espa oles advirtiendo que la repetici n de la crisis de los mecanismos de tipo de cambio erm de comienzos de los a os 90 podr a exterminar el capital base de las debilitadas entidades crediticias expuestas a un crack inmobiliario
1302590 los buitres est n empezando a volar en c rculo en torno al desventurado sr solbes los cr ticos piden su cabeza acus ndolo de ocultar la aut ntica dimensi n de la desaceleraci n antes de que tuviera lugar la reelecci n de los socialistas el pasado mes de marzo esto parece injusto solbes durante mucho tiempo despu s continu desestimando las advertencias de una crisis consider ndolas enormemente exageradas ahora parece estar realmente estupefacto por lo que ha ocurrido
1302591 en francia una d bil llovizna reemplaza a un cielo gris al que a ratos surcan algunos claros en espa a tras un largo y soleado per odo se concentran negros nubarrones anunciando quiz s la tormenta el socialista jos luis rodr guez zapatero no ha intentado romper con una f rmula econ mica que el pa s aprovech bien incluso con el gobierno de derechas de jos mar a aznar la mala suerte ha querido que su nuevo mandato coincida con el agotamiento de la martingala espa ola el sector inmobiliario m s el consumo todo ello financiado mediante el endeudamiento de las familias
1302592 la iron a es que en la actualidad pedro solbes de nuevo ministro de econom a tiene que encontrar las soluciones para impedir que la ralentizaci n espa ola no se transforme en recesi n
1302593 la seria desaceleraci n actual no es comparable con la crisis que vivi espa a hace quince a os las causas son diferentes al igual que el resultado
1302594 la desaceleraci n econ mica actual dif cilmente es comparable con la crisis de 1992 1993 las cifras son elocuentes el 5 6 de inflaci n en 1992 contra el 5 3 del mes pasado mes de julio en cuanto al paro el ndice oscilaba alrededor de un 20 llegando a su r cord con el 23 9 de 1994 contra solamente en 9 6 del primer trimestre del a o 2008 la misma diferencia existe entre las cuentas p blicas de 1992 que registraban un d ficit del 7 y las de 2007 excedentarias en torno al 2 2 del pib
1302595 a pesar de la preocupaci n que suscitan los 16 a os de intervalo estas dos crisis siguen siendo fundamentalmente distintas la de 1992 fue resultado de la crisis del sistema monetario europeo la de 2007 2008 radica en un crack inmobiliario y otra diferencia notable es que el euro no exist a en 1992 y espa a pod a permitirse como ya hizo emprender una serie de devaluaciones para recuperar la competitividad en los precios de sus productos exportados las consecuencias de la crisis actual son dif ciles de evaluar a largo plazo
1302596 el sistema financiero parece estar bien parapetado frente a las turbulencias
1302597 los bancos y cajas de ahorro espa oles se aprovechan de su fuerte captaci n de ahorro pero ven c mo aumentan los impagados
1302598 frente a la crisis espa a dispone de una baza innegable su sistema financiero es el que hasta ahora ha aguantado mejor en europa las turbulencias internacionales hay varios factores que contribuyen a ello en primer lugar la importancia de las actividades del banco al por menor en sus cuentas en efecto son ellas las que han actuado como colch n estabilizador frente a las fluctuaciones de la coyuntura a las que est n menos sometidas
1302599 adem s los bancos y cajas de ahorro espa oles constituyen formidables m quinas de captaci n del ahorro de particulares que hacen que sean menos vulnerables en estos tiempos y son ellos los que deber an permitir dar respuesta a lo que ser a el tal n de aquiles del sector el preocupante incremento de cr ditos dudosos e impagados que en un a o ha pasado del 0 67 al 1 23 del total su progresi n podr a incluso ir a m s si el concurso de acreedores de martinsa creara escuela

1302605 en espa a actualmente no pasa un solo d a sin que aparezca una noticia preocupante relacionada con la econom a pr cticamente se ha paralizado el crecimiento el mercado inmobiliario se ha venido abajo la inflaci n ha crecido y ayer lunes se dio a conocer que la cuota de desempleo ha alcanzado su punto m s alto en diez a os a nivel psic logico resulta especialmente significativo que las cifras de parados hayan aumentado de forma at pica para la temporada puesto que normalmente el mercado laboral se activa en los meses de verano a causa de la demanda tur stica para los espa oles esta tendencia pone de manifiesto una amarga realidad el punto m s bajo a n no se ha alcanzado ni de lejos en estos momentos se parte ya de que hasta finales del pr ximo a o la cuota de desempleo subir al quince por ciento un nivel desconocido durante mucho tiempo
1302606 la oposici n acusa al gobierno socialista de no actuar con lo que sigue un juego muy f cil en efecto durante mucho tiempo el gobierno socialista incluso se ha resistido a denominar como tal la crisis que se est extendiendo as pues muchos espa oles tienen la impresi n de encontrarse ante una ejecutiva que ha perdido la visi n de la realidad pero en realidad el gobierno espa ol ha tomado medidas la buena noticia es que no est cayendo en el accionismo en todo caso tampoco hay tanto que pueda hacer lo nico que ahora servir a de ayuda ser a reducir los intereses pero esto es algo que s lo puede decidir el banco de espa a la intervenci n m s importante que se ha tomado hasta la fecha consistente en estimular el sector de la construcci n p blica surtir efecto nicamente a medio plazo los espa oles han de prepararse por tanto para una largo per odo de sequ a
1302607 los bancos espa oles se defienden de la crisis de los pr stamos dada las dificultades del sector inmobiliario aumentando en seis meses hasta el 67 los fondos de garant a la tasa de morosidad ha aumentado levemente pero poco en comparaci n el dato de la ue pero la salud del sistema bancario es buena en los pr ximos meses no deber an presentarse problemas en el sector de las finanzas exceptuando el caso de los peque os bancos locales que podr an ser absorbidos por instituciones m s grandes pero un estudio reciente de morgan stanley afirma que no obstante las ganancias del primer semestre del 2008 el futuro es incierto y podr a ser dif cil a causa de la crisis del sector inmobiliario

1302628 hace un a o creci la sensaci n de que detr s del nerviosismo de los mercados financieros se escond a algo m s que una mera desaceleraci n puntual la crisis del mercado inmobiliario americano empez entonces a exigir sus primeras v ctimas y las bolsas se desplomaron el 9 de agosto del 2007 el banco central europeo se vio incluso obligado a inyectar ingentes sumas en el sistema bancario para prevenir una escasez de cr dito la fed sigui r pidamente el ejemplo en ese momento parec a que la estructura del sistema bancario internacional tras largos a os de bonanza era lo suficientemente robusta como para encajar el golpe un a o despu s esa sensaci n tambi n empieza a evaporarse

1302632 como en la mayor a de las informaciones chinas sobre atentados terroristas stas se basan nicamente en los medios informativos dirigidos por el estado no obstante nadie puede negar que tambi n china se enfrenta a los problemas del terrorismo la nica duda es cu n grande es el peligro y si china reacciona de manera adecuada
1302633 por qu azuza pek n el miedo ante el terrorismo con informaciones tan detalladas todos los a os se producen cientos de ataques violentos tambi n contra cuarteles de la polic a el gobierno casi siempre trata de ocultarlo la nueva e inhabitual pol tica informativa de china hace temer que el gobierno cuenta seriamente con atentados durante los juegos ol mpicos

1302650 the white house had concocted a fake letter from the director of the iraqi intelligence service to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1302651 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1302652 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1302653 they secretly resettled the intelligence official in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1302654 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1302655 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1302656 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1302657 we need to send a message to the next president that if he conducts himself in a similar capacity it would be met with a response from the congress that you are going to be held to account there is a point at which you reduce congress to a debating society

1302663 the united states would torture a mentally disturbed man and then leap screaming at every word he uttered
1302664 from the very beginning there was a conviction that saddam hussein was a bad person and that he needed to go

1302669 device manufacturers do not need to reinvent the push email and mobile sync wheel
1302670 funambol v7 enables them to rapidly deploy a sync service for push email pim data and other value added mobile content without limiting users to a particular device mail server or pim system
1302671 this subject did come up frequently in our directors meeting
1302672 some agencies had more than one political briefing during an election cycle
1302673 for example at commerce reportedly political appointees attended an office of political affairs presentation at the agency and then the commerce secretary with senior commerce political staff attended a second private briefing at the white house the office of political affairs would draft the presentations they would get polling information from somebody on staff who had experience in polling information and sometimes they did get it from the rnc

1302678 we can confirm that bbc wales will be broadcasting an apology to mr lucas on tuesday
1302679 last november a documentary about the work of the chief constable of north wales richard brunstrom was broadcast on bbc one wales
1302680 in it the chief constable and another officer made strong criticisms of mr ian lucas the mp for wrexham for which north wales police subsequently apologised
1302681 we would like to apologise for broadcasting the criticisms without checking their accuracy and in a context where mr lucas had no right to reply to them
1302682 we would also like to clarify that remarks criticising the chief constable for addressing a meeting of the welsh language pressure group cymuned which were attributed in the programme to mr lucas were in fact made by mr mark tami mp for alyn and deeside
1302683 the longer it goes on they actually draw strength from that
1302684 you have to ask what the police were trying to achieve by over presenting evidence that they did not have and clearly could not claim to have
1302685 it would appear they were seeking to apply pressure by overstating the evidence that they had and frankly it is a scandal

1302688 wir haben eine 20 jahre w hrende partnerschaft mit der nfl darauf sind wir unglaublich stolz und eine etwa f nfzehnj hrige partnerschaft mit der nba nhl und so weiter wir sind aber auch partner von j k rowling und warner bros mit denen wir harry potter spiele auf den markt bringen

1302690 the second quarter of 2008 was both a period of business development in which we made a synergistic acquisition acquiring the assets of compwise as well as improved financial results particularly in terms of revenue and gross margins
1302691 at the same time we are reviewing ways to better manage our cost structure while improving efficiency and cutting costs particularly on the manufacturing and procurement side without sacrificing our growth potential with the aim to quickly reach the breakeven level
1302692 during the quarter we completed the acquisition of compwises assets an israeli based provider of business analytic solutions for telecom operators we see the acquisition as very much aligned with our long term growth strategy which focuses on solid execution innovation and m amp a activity we continue to work on strengthening our foundations for future growth and execution while reducing costs with the goal of enhancing our position as a major player in the integrated revenue management and assurance space
1302693 ich wei nur dass sie interesse an mir haben mehr m chte ich dazu nicht sagen
1302694 a resposta escrita do ir aos seis pa ses envolvidos nas negocia es nucleares foi entregue a autoridades da uni o europ ia pelo embaixador iraniano em bruxelas
1302695 mi sembra tra laltro significativo che loro stessi dicano di non essere degli angeli ma abbiano sempre negato su bologna
1302696 il problema allora chiedersi perch proprio una parte della sinistra si ostini a negare ogni dubbio su quella sentenza
1302697 there are parts where it can be a bit more mud than sand
1302698 now shes wearing just one necklace with a cross on it to remind you she is madonna
1302699 we work closely with the police to tackle any signs of gang activity as soon as they present themselves within the prison
1302700 the board congratulates the governor and staff for their efforts in guiding the prison through a difficult year and ensuring that rochester remains one of the best young offender institutions in the country
1302701 coupled with an increase in the basic speeding fine this means speeding tickets are now raising over 100 million a year for the government
1302702 ministers need to tell us what they are doing with this 100 million a year taken from motorists is labour using speeding tickets just to raise revenue rather than making our roads safer
1302703 safety cameras are there to save lives not make money
1302704 one of our safer community team strategic actions this year is to reduce street disorder and a common catalyst for this is alcohol
1302705 on the scene police also found two knives used in the attack and some propaganda material advocating a holy war
1302706 im happy because this was a brave act and it shows that uighurs have courage and resist the government to get our independence but im sad because this will mean more pressure on us
1302707 if they arrest people it takes a few days before you hear about it because the news does not report it and the families of those people are too afraid to speak out
1302708 there is always the risk to the security of the bejing olympics
1302709 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1302710 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1302711 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1302712 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1302713 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1302714 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1302715 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1302716 has a broken arm broken elbow and minor shoulder damage but is in good spirits
1302717 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1302718 they had to use the jaws of life hydraulic cutters to extract him from the vehicle
1302719 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1302720 his voice was clear even though marco starts feeling pain at his lower limbs
1302721 marco has reached the main base camp he is recovering the base camp has facilities to provide him with immediate medical help like oxygen and drugs so he will improve gradually
1302722 everything was going well to camp 4 and then on the summit attempt everything went wrong
1302723 we had to move them that took of course many many hours some turned back because they did not trust it anymore
1302724 there was a korean guy hanging upside down there was a second korean guy who held him with a rope but he was also in shock and then a third guy was there also and they were trying to survive but i also had to survive
1302725 everybody was fighting for himself and i still do not understand why everybody was leaving each other
1302726 people were running down but didnt know where to go so a lot of people were lost on the mountain on the wrong side wrong route and then you have a big problem
1302727 black people are socially inferior incoherent individuals but they sure do love tea
1302728 there were five teenagers who seemed to know the area but they had one gentleman with them who seemed to be inexperienced and he was suffering from hypothermia he was exhausted by the time we got to him we had to stretcher lower him down some pretty difficult ground
1302729 they were cold and wet but by the time wed given them some warm drinks and food we got them moving again they were okay
1302730 its always sad when something like this happens but when you go out to make these climbs its always in the back of your head
1302731 but once you do start climbing and going towards the goal it becomes all encompassing and thats what you think about
1302732 its a tragedy for the family and i feel for them because gerard was a lovely fella and a brilliant climber he was a very loyal friend and somebody that taught me a lot about climbing as well
1302733 he loved life adored life ill always remember his zest for life and joy of climbing
1302734 theres a bit of a bottleneck when you come off the summit
1302735 there had been a number of climbers congregated together there was a big slab at the side of the mountain that collapsed and swept them all away
1302736 when he was up a couple of years ago unfortunately he got hit by a rock about 600 metres from the summit and had a fractured skull and was airlifted out
1302737 he was prepared for that and worked really hard he wouldnt have undertaken it knowing it wasnt a possibility because he was a superb climber
1302738 utilizan por ejemplo hienas amaestradas o cargan con los coches para que los animales les embistan con lo que logran planos espectaculares
1302739 torear a mi aire ojal entren al trapo los enemigos sin ellos me quedo en nada
1302740 las cosas pueden cambiar de un d a para otro pero en este momento la nica certeza es que tengo contrato con el valencia
1302741 donde tengo la esperanza de que se demuestre mi inocencia
1302742 eso siempre ser algo complicado pero es mejor esperar a ver qu pasa
1302743 teniendo en cuenta estas circunstancias as como la postura del ministro de deportes vitali mutk quien declar que deportistas rusos no deben verse involucrados en esc ndalos de dopaje en los juegos la federaci n decidi excluir a g sev de los juegos
1302744 es ist wundersch n hier das einzige was ich vermisse ist ein boot um ausfl ge aufs offene meer zu unternehmen
1302745 ach mach dir keine sorgen das sind nur die katholiken die wollen das so
1302746 ein richtig cooles tool zumindest wenns dann mal fertig ist die
1302747 el primero de equipo que entr en el programa ol mpico
1302748 quiero recordar al presidente blatter que el hockey tambi n celebrar en estos juegos sus cien a os como modalidad ol mpica
1302749 podemos garantizar unos juegos ol mpicos seguros y pac ficos
1302750 la mejor soluci n ser a hacerlo antes de la previa
1302751 estamos en un proceso de ver reacciones y sobre todo tambi n mirar c mo se ve pep guardiola con el grupo y con el jugador
1302752 respetamos la resoluci n de la fifa pero si el tas dice lo contrario el club defender a que est con nosotros respetamos la normativa y la legalidad y pedimos la misma comprensi n
1302753 los conceptos que hab amos visto con el bar a b se est n viendo en jugadores de m s calidad
1302754 la tranquilidad de ver que los jugadores del filial son pr cticamente los que lo hacen mejor
1302755 qu prefiero el n mero uno ya lo tengo asegurado mi objetivo es hacer un buen papel aqu en pek n y una vez que pase esto mi pretensi n es acabar como n mero uno
1302756 el n mero uno es importante pero m s es ganar wimbledon por ejemplo
1302757 para nosotros los tenistas los juegos ol mpicos son importantes tras los torneos del grand slam es lo m s importante del a o los grand slam est n un poco por encima pero despu s lo m s importante junto a la copa davis o la copa masters de shangai
1302758 soy un candidato m s pero no m s que los dem s lo importante es adaptarse pronto llevo muchos partidos encima y espero tener tiempo para adaptarme
1302759 novak djokovic o roger federer son los favoritos porque la pista se les da mejor despu s estamos el resto
1302760 en la villa ol mpica estamos muy bien es una experiencia muy distinta a la que estamos habituados vas conociendo al resto de deportistas la acogida ha sido muy buena todos se han portado muy bien con nosotros
1302761 no creo que el recibimiento fuera de n mero uno llevo a os ah arriba puede ser m s por ganar wimbledon o roland garros el n mero uno es m s importante pero m s ganar wimbledon
1302762 no cambia nada ir de uno o de dos en un cuadro lo nico que supone es haber cumplido un objetivo y tocar esta situaci n despu s de los a os que llevo eso es muy bonito y es una gran ilusi n
1302763 if the point of green taxes is to change behaviour they need to be properly publicised so that people are fully aware of what they are being encouraged to do

1302765 youtube in podobni servisi so postali za politike pomembno komunikacijsko orodje v asih pa tudi no na mora z youtubom oziroma z internetom nasploh so navadni ljudje dobili enako mo kot je bila do takrat rezervirana za mno i ne medije in pr oddelke politikov

1302772 many digital content goods and services are becoming basic must haves particularly in the sub 35 age group devices like the iphone even in its 3g incarnation are undoubtedly contributing to consumer awareness and usage of mobile music services people who are 15 to 20 today will expect to buy directly with their phones and will drive this market over the next few years
1302773 even though typical transaction sizes will remain in the 3 5 bracket a sufficient number of users will be using their mobiles to buy music games tickets infotainment and the other digital goods sufficiently often to see gross transaction value grow nearly seven fold by 2013
1302774 were pleased to lead the way in adopting deviceatlas as our standard for mobile content development
1302775 dotmobis deviceatlas is unique in that it ties together the mobile content operator and handset communities and lets us create the kind of specialised content that continues to differentiate msn in the market
1302776 since implementing deviceatlas and launching our mobi site weve seen an increase in registrations interestingly customers are coming from all over the world i think that shows the power of the mobi domain in marketing a brand

1302794 a guy i met who can you please just call him and tell him where i am
1302795 but i have never been in a race i grew up around boats but im not the yachting type ive sailed to do research
1302796 whales and seals until the money for my last job dried up i was in california the last place you want a state funded job right now
1302797 according to the emt who took your vitals it was mostly nonsense but weirdly intelligible
1302798 when i arrived you were asking for band aids and coleslaw and there was something about krishna sloughing
1302799 i can feel that in case youve reserved a wheelchair
1302800 dr a will be through in an hour one more night without further complications and we are copacetic upstairs you go
1302801 gwendolyn taking good care of you everything to your satisfaction
1302802 just swell id turn down mar a lago to be here
1302803 the worst thing that could possibly happen to you to a parent
1302804 that youd be conscious of aids watching helplessly while your bodys colonized by a kamikaze virus or genocide watching your family get slaughtered by your neighbors
1302805 what a nice imagination you have but what do you mean conscious of whats the biggest tragedy you wouldnt be conscious of
1302806 letting life pass you by living like a starfish clinging to your one unchanging colorless rock
1302807 well arent we superior living our lives like the glorious vertebrates we are
1302808 say life passes you by if you dont have children having children is life being a parent
1302809 guess ive yet to meet a gene pool worthy of mine
1302810 or youre afraid of your animal self thats the danger of living too close to the beasts when the idea seems repulsive to me the idea of kids thats what i suspect like all this education all this cerebral honing and im going to what fritter away my time sniffing small butts aiming spoonfuls of mush at drooling mouths but even more i think will i let myself knuckle under to my instincts with no more control than my ancestors down in olduvai gorge
1302811 i want a wild and freewheeling life a life of pick up and go
1302812 i believe anything can happen theres no individual ration of good and bad but i cant lose sight of gods purpose its sort of there all the time just outside my peripheral vision embracing us everywhere a grand invisible womb
1302813 it is such a huge project it is taking longer than expected
1302814 we are looking to officially launch in september by then hopefully the contracts will all be in place
1302815 you only have one chance to make a good first impression
1302816 quite simply nick is the better programmer with more experience but matt is
1302817 the top 10 worst insert blank silly popculture thing of all time
1302818 as part of a final peace settlement israel must have secure and recognized borders which should emerge from negotiations between the parties in accordance with unsc un security council resolutions 242 and 338 in light of new realities on the ground including already existing major israeli populations centers it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949 and all previous efforts to negotiate a two state solution have reached the same conclusion it is realistic to expect that any final status agreement will only be achieved on the basis of mutually agreed changes that reflect these realities
1302819 whether getting that buffer is worth the antagonism of the other party
1302820 take a deal that may not perfectly align with the 67 boundaries
1302821 the understanding that i was briefed on this groups plans is incorrect
1302822 sanzars current position is that it is a very much a three country expansion of super rugby with south africa involved
1302823 the trans tasman idea does not include south africa and that is absolutely not the nzrus preferred position at the moment
1302824 these would be great results in any year this year they are exceptional
1302825 we have a strong and sustainable business guided by a clear and consistent strategy and we enter the second half in good shape
1302826 however our markets are being affected by inflation high energy and commodity prices and the consequences of the slowdown in the west
1302827 estamos enfrentando grandes dificultades para atenderlos no estamos preparados para eso desde el 2001 no hab amos recibido ning n ping ino por aqu y desde el 17 de julio pasado ya hemos recibido cerca de 500
1302828 primero los ubicamos en el centro de rehabilitaci n que est bamos construyendo y despu s tuvimos que improvisar alojamientos en las piscinas en las cl nicas y hasta en nuestro auditorio todas nuestras reas est n comprometidas
1302829 tuvimos que pedirle ayuda a la marina que nos prest tres tiendas de campa a que montamos en el rea externa y adonde estamos llevando a los que est n en mejores condiciones
1302830 montamos una base en la ciudad de aracaj en donde tenemos los diez ping inos que se han aventurado m s lejos
1302831 a n no sabemos a qu obedece la avalancha actual pero creemos que el fen meno de la ni a y algunos de los cambios clim ticos provocados por el efecto invernadero est n enfriando las corrientes marinas y arrastrando las aguas fr as de la patagonia m s al norte
1302832 incluso en salvador la temperatura del agua est actualmente tres grados cent grados m s fr a que lo normal
1302833 pero esos ping inos soportan temperaturas que var an entre los 7 y los 30 grados cent grados no son de zonas totalmente heladas y por eso no llegan a sentirse totalmente inc modos en salvador en donde la temperatura promedio es de 28 grados cent grados
1302834 revertir el estado en que llegan es muy complicado y tenemos que tratarlos con medicinas y alimentarlos con pur de sardina pero estamos logrando un proceso satisfactorio de recuperaci n y ya conseguimos que algunos se alimenten solos
1302835 el hallazgo de los f siles nos permite ver la ant rtida tal y como fue justo antes del cambio clim tico hace 13 9 millones de a os es una ventana con una vista nica al pasado
1302836 lo que estamos viendo es el ltimo rastro de vegetaci n en los valles secos el descubrimiento de los f siles y de las cenizas volc nicas nos demuestra que hace 14 1 millones de a os el rea alberg una tundra
1302837 ha sido uno de los cambios climatol gicos m s espectaculares y prolongados que uno se puede imaginar no conozco ning n otro lugar en la tierra en el que se haya producido un cambio tan dr stico
1302838 al menos seis ballenas de gran porte varias de ellas con sus hijos se acercaron a menos de 100 metros de la costa
1302839 en otras ocasiones se han visto en la zona una o dos ballenas pero nunca tantas y tan cerca
1302840 est n sanos en cuanto a tama o forma y peso
1302841 estamos preservando con este acuerdo el ecosistema amaz nico y el pantanal sin romper la producci n que ya existe y colocando restricciones que van a hacer que se adec e a la defensa del ecosistema y no al contrario
1302842 generalmente lo que es grande y f cil de atrapar desaparece r pidamente
1302843 en muchos lugares los primates est n literalmente siendo devorados hasta la extinci n
1302844 la destrucci n de los bosques tropicales ha sido siempre la causa principal pero ahora parece que la caza es una amenaza igual de seria en algunas zonas a n donde el h bitat est pr cticamente intacto
1302845 el problema con estas especies es que tienen vidas largas lo que hace que tome tiempo para revertir el descenso es realmente deprimente
1302846 los primates son relativamente f ciles de cazar porque son diurnos viven en grupos y hacen ruido son blancos f ciles
1302847 muchos de los primates asi ticos como los langures pesan 5 a 10 kilos as que son un buen objetivo generalmente lo que es grande y f cil de atrapar desaparece r pidamente
1302848 si matan 7 10 o 20 gorilas del monte eso tiene un impacto devastador sobre toda la poblaci n
1302849 los tit es estaban casi extintos en estado salvaje pero eran muy populares en los zool gicos as que eran una poblaci n cautiva muy grande
1302850 as que los zool gicos del mundo decidieron unirse para empezar un programa de reintroducci n de tit es en la selva brasile a

1302891 johann grander is een natuuronderzoeker die water en waterverontreiniging bestudeerd heeft de mens heeft de zelfreinigende watercyclus verstoord door de aanleg van kanalen en leidingnetten en daarom is het water dat wij drinken energiearm geworden johann grander gaat er net als veel andere natuuronderzoekers van uit dat water informatie opslaat in een geheugen hij denkt dat dit geheugen niet door waterzuivering gewist kan worden daardoor blijven er verontreinigingen in aanwezig daar komt nog bij dat water tegenwoordig te extensief wordt gebruikt en te vaak wordt hergebruikt zodat het geen kans heeft zichzelf te regenereren de werking van de verlevendiging van water berust op het principe dat water zonder direct contact de aanwezige informatie in het geheugen over kan brengen op langsstromend water wanneer dus verlevendigd water langs verontreinigd water stroomt wordt de informatie die het verontreinigde water bevat uit het geheugen gewist en houdt men zuiver water over om te zorgen dat mensen van zijn verlevendigingstechniek konden gaan profiteren heeft grander een speciaal waterverlevendigingsapparaat ontwikkeld dat bestaat uit kamers met grander concentraat ver verlevendigd water aan vier zijden die zijn omhuld met magnetisch chroomstaal het water met een lagere frequentie stroomt erdoor en krijgt door trillingen weer een hogere frequentie omdat de energieoverdracht via trillingen plaatsvindt hoeft er geen contact te zijn tussen het grander concentraat en het te zuiveren water

1302893 the degradation of an individual does not encompass the certainty by which that individual sees himself for one to see himself in true light requires both certitude and verity it is only with a lack of levity in character that one rises above the trifles of day to day life to obtain light sometimes no most of the time we need each other to obtain light
1302894 you know youre the kind of guy id want to know more about you make me curious michael
1302895 twenty years ago a lecturer of mine once said the degradation of an individual does not encompass the certainty by which that individual sees himself
1302896 the objects of nature change very slowly a palm tree remains a palm tree it remains what it is and will not change for a very long time unless it is very young and immature the more mature the more set in its ways an object is all that changes then is what we think of it and how we appreciate it
1302897 it is the same for everything else most mature things are constant the change we observe in them comes from us
1302898 what changes most in this universe is what we the vice regents of god on this earth do our free will our choice and reason is what makes us different from other creatures and objects we can change in an instant
1302899 yet the older we get like the mature palm tree the less potential for change we have and the less potential for change we see in others

1302909 at no point of time did the tatas think of leaving singur
1302910 there is no truth in the statements that many workers had already left the plant site and that something very serious in magnitude had taken place

1302913 a rise of 2 degrees may mask big problems that actually begin at a lower level of warming

1302915 this is the way the world ends not with a bang but a whimper
1302916 it tells us for example that only a government that was sleepwalking or in a chemically induced coma would countenance building a third runway at heathrow or a new generation of coal fired power stations such as the proposed new plant at kingsnorth in kent infrastructure that is fossil fuel dependent locks in patterns of future greenhouse gas emissions radically reducing our ability to make the short to medium term cuts that are necessary
1302917 the government was not acting in the spirit of these recommendations
1302918 the ministries themselves need to provide a personal example by becoming more energy efficient and environmentally friendly
1302919 its frustrating but youve got to be positive and move on now to get our heads focused on poole
1302920 alumina production has normalised at the damanjodi plant since yesterday but we continue to struggle for coal
1302921 our next commitment is due after august 15 and we are hopeful of meeting it
1302922 if coal supply is not normalised it would affect the refining production and thereby the smelter production and export of alumina
1302923 we have already harmonised our export control requirements with that of nsg
1302924 all we want is a clean and unconditional exemption from the nsg
1302925 nsg guidelines require comprehensive safeguards applicable only to npt countries and since india has both civil and military programmes we have a unique position therefore such comprehensive safeguards are not relevant to india hence clean exemption from that is what we are seeking
1302926 they should exempt india from the requirement of comprehensive safeguards and add no other conditions
1302927 we plan to invest rs 25 crore in the next five years in setting up 75 retail and institutional spas to capture a large chunk of the rs 1 000 crore spa health care business in the country

1302929 hopefully by august end we will start the pilot project

1302938 bij het hotel aangekomen zaten we met 6 pers in de lift die maar voor max 4 pers bedoeld was dat volgde dus in een stilstaande lift halverwege 2 verdiepingen na meerdere malen op en neer gegaan te zijn werden we uiteindelijk bevrijd rond 14 00 uur gingen we met de bus op weg naar de tochalberg met de stoeltjeslift bij darband zijn we omhoog gegaan waarna we een pittige wandeling hebben gemaakt halverwege de wandeling hebben we nog gezellig bij een traditioneel perzisch theehuis ab ghoesht gegeten dit is een lokaal gerecht bestaande uit kikkererwten aardappel lamsvlees schapenvet witte bonen uien tomaten peper zout en koriander het wordt geserveerd in een kan met stamper de soep wordt dan eruit gegoten wat je kan opdrinken de overtollige ingredienten worden dan met een stamper tot een stampot gemaakt dit wordt dan met iraans brood gegeten tevens heb ik een dug zachte karnemelk op smaak gebracht met kruiden en zout genomen het was de eerste en tevens laatste keer het witte drankje vind ik echt niet te pruimen na de stevige maaltijd zijn we verder gelopen naar ons guesthouse in de bergen waar we rond 18 15 aankwamen het uitzicht was prachtig wat resulteerde in een fotosessie bij het avondeten werden allerlei gerechten geserveerd zoals aubergine lamskebab salades safraanrijst en brood rond 22 30 lag ik dan na een lekkere warme douche geheel voldaan maar vermoeid in bed zaterdag 5 april om 8 00 zaten we met zn allen aan het ontbijt een uurtje later vertrokken we voor een wandeling door de bergen ria en karin zijn achtergebleven ria had er gisteren duidelijk moeite mee om de steile hellingen baas te worden dus ze hielden de wandeling vanochtend voor gezien 11 00 uur zijn we met zn allen naar beneden gelopen waar we rond 12 30 aankwamen hier nam ik met ria karin birgit evelyne en leon een taxi naar het dichtsbijzijnde metrostation we moesten met de metro van eindpunt naar eindpunt met het doel het mausoleum van imam khomeini te bezichtigen de metro in teheran is trouwens heel modern en schoon de voorste en achterste wagons zijn alleen bestemd voor vrouwen hier mogen geen mannen naar binnen vrouwen mogen trouwens ook in andere wagons instappen na aankomst hebben we eerst een stevige lunch genuttigd bestaande uit brood met gegrilde kip waarna we het mausoleum binnen zijn gegaan het is een gigantisch complex maar de tombe zelf stelt niet veel voor er wordt nog steeds gewerkt aan deze laatste rustplaats van khomeini die vlak na de islamitische revolutie en tijdens de begrafenis miljoenen iraniers op de been kreeg en velen komen hier om hem respect te tonen verder hebben we de immens grote begraafplaats bij het mausoleum nog bezocht we waren eigenlijk op zoek naar het martelarenkerkhof maar hebben het niet kunnen vinden wegens tijdgebrek hadden we ook niet meer genoeg tijd om het te zoeken om 17 30 moesten we immers terug zijn in het kowsar hotel na een chocolade bananen taart gegeten te hebben wat tevens mijn diner voorstelde zijn we met de bus op weg gegaan naar het treinstation rond 20 30 hebben we plaats genomen in twee 6 persoons coupes het was allemaal goed geregeld schone lakens dekens en kussens waren aanwezig ik had een plaatsje op een van de bovenste bedjes geregeld maar dit was geen succes heb het die nacht behoorlijk benauwd geweest had het erg warm wat resulteerde in een nacht waarin ik nauwelijks niet heb geslapen zondag 6 april rond 7 00 uur kwamen we met de nachttrein aan in de woestijnstad yazd deze stad is het centrum van de leer van zarathoestra deze leer was voor islam de officiele godsdienst en stamt uit de periode van 550 b c er zijn nog zon 10 000 aanhangers met de taxi zijn we naar het hotel mehr gegaan het was echt een supergaaf idylisch hotel met meerdere binnenplaatsen met houten bedden voorzien van perzische tapijten na een heerlijke douche hebben we rond 8 00 uur plaats genomen aan de ontbijttafel ook hier bestond het ontbijt uit brood tomaten komkommer dadels ei kaas etc ditmaal waren er ook bakjes room judith dacht dat het een lekker bakje yoghurt zou zijn maar het bleek echt pure slagroom te zijn wat hiermee nu precies de bedoeling is bij het ontbijt is me nog steeds niet geheel duidelijk rond 9 30 uur ben ik samen met birgit ria en karin met de taxi naar de torens der stilte vertrokken die net buiten de stad liggen de vereerders van ahora mazda legden vroeger hier hun doden neer voor de gieren zo werden aarde en lucht niet vervuild hiernaast ligt ook nog de moderne begraafplaats sinds de jaren zeventig begraaft men de doden daar de betonnen graven zijn ondoordringbaar om doorsijpeling in de aarde te voorkomen na dit bezoek volgde er een ritje naar de atashgah e varahram de moderne zoroastrische vuurtempel de tempel is omgeven door een tuin op de voorgevel prijkt faravahar het symbool van de god ahura mazda achter glas wordt het heilig vuur dat rond 1940 naar deze tempel werd overgebracht reeds 1500 jaar brandend gehouden weer in yazd aangekomen heb ik een heerlijk vers wortelsapje gedronken dit is echt ontzettend lekker en redelijk populair in iran overal is het te verkrijgen alles is trouwens tegen mijn verwachting in heel goedkoop in iran een softijsje kost ong 14 eurocent een wortelsapje tussen de 14 en 28 cent en een blikje coca cola light ong 40 cent in de loop van de ochtend hebben we nog verschillende moskeen het watermuseum en de bazaar bezocht met zn vieren zijn we gaan lunchen in een heel sfeervol traditioneel restaurant hier hebben we shooli gegeten een typische yazd soep bestaande uit groene groente waaronder spinazie rond 15 00 waren we moe en zijn we terug naar ons hotel gegaan waar we weer neerploften op de perzische tapijten op de binnenplaats hier kwamen we er door de reisgenoten achter dat we de beroemde mooie masjed e jameh de vrijdagsmoskee uit de veeriende eeuw nog steeds niet gezien hadden die avond voor het diner zijn we toch nog even op weg gegaan naar deze moskee die we niet wilden missen op weg ernaar toe liepen we door de oude stad yazd het is heel bijzonder een wirwar aan kronkelige straatjes we hebben we nog een bakker aan het werk gezien de broden worden op een speciale manier gemaakt ze worden tegen de wand van de oven gegooid om te bakken de vrijdagsmoskee was echt de moeite waard te bekijken het diner op een dakterras bestond vandaag uit een buffet van verschillende traditionele gerechten de iraanse keuken is best lekker maar mist mijns inziens toch wat smaak het is allemaal een beetje flauwtjes en dit terwijl ze toch veel kruiden gebruiken s avonds hebben we nog de lokale sport zurkhane bezocht dit is een soort aerobic wat plaatsvind in een ronde kring op religieuze trommel muziek terug in het hotel hebben we met zn allen weer even plaats genomen op de o zo heerlijke perzische tapijten hier heb ik nog een rosenwater genuttigd een vreemd drankje wat ruikt en smaakt naar zeep niet voor herhaling vatbaar dus maandag 7 april 7 15 klonk het wakker worden uit de gsm van birgit snel douchen inpakken ontbijten en om 8 00 zaten we dan met zn allen in de bus op weg naar onze volgende bestemming shiraz rond 10 45 maakten we in het dorpje abarqu een tussenstop al snel hadden kleine kinderen ons in de gaten en werden we meegenomen naar een dak waar we uitzicht hadden op het dorp verder hebben we een oud gebouw bezocht wat nu omgetoverd wordt tot een hotel ze zijn al ong 5 jaar hierin bezig maar de bouw ligt al 1 jaar stil wegens gebrek aan geld aan de rand van het dorp staat een citrus boom waarvan wordt beweerd dat hij 5000 jaar oud is om 11 45 zijn we met de bus verder gereden de lunch bestond uit vegetarische sandwiches belegd met groente waaronder spinazie die karin had meegenomen als toetje hadden we een mierzoet koekje van de bekende en beste koekjeswinkel van yazd die karin de vorige dag had gekocht de locatie was trouwens wel apart we hebben we gegeten voor de ingang van een moskee in aanbouw iemand die er aanwezig was heeft speciaal voor ons nog matjes neergelegd 1 uurtje later vervolgden we onze reis op weg naar persepolis waar we rond 15 30 aankwamen koning darius de grote begon in 512 b c met de bouw van dit uitgestrekte paleizencomplex het meest spectaculair zijn de bas reliefs die 300 m lang zijn haarscherp hebben ze de tand des tijds doorstaan we hadden een rondleiding van een gids maar ik had echt geen interesse en was te moe om zijn verhaal aandachtig te volgen dus ik ben maar aan het fotograferen geslagen rond 18 30 vervolgden we dan uiteindelijk onze reis naar shiraz waar we rond 19 45 aankwamen in het aryo barzan hotel met de groep behalve leon en paul die zich beiden niet geheel lekker voelden zijn we s avonds nog gaan eten bij een lokale eettent halverwege mijn diner viel de stroom uit zodat we in het donker verder hebben gegeten ach alles heeft zijn charme na een lange vermoeiende dag lag ik dan rond 23 30 in bed 7 45 opstaan en ontbijten vandaag regende het een beetje met birgit ben ik de stad in gegaan we zijn begonnen in de bazaar waar we heerlijk hebben rondgesnuffeld tevens hebben we veel fotos geschoten van de kleine winkeltjes en de eigenaren etc ik vond het echt super om hier rond te lopen de mensen zijn ook erg aardig en helemaal niet opdringerig in tegenstelling tot veel andere landen rond de middag kwamen we bob en judith tegen en zijn we samen een theehuis binnen gegaan hier hebben we voor de afwisseling eens een heerlijk kopje koffie gedronken even later kwamen ook leon karin ria ella en evelyne binnen grappig dat je elkaar toch overal treft in de middag ben ik met birgit op zoek gegaan naar de tombe van shah e cheragh de broer van imam reza ligt hier begraven omgeven door duizenden spiegeltjes die een oogverblindende indruk achterlaten door de bazaar kwamen we uiteindelijk via de achteringang uit op het plein van het complex op zoek naar een chador die bij de vooringang te verkrijgen was zijn we weer naar buiten gelopen waarna we vervolgens terug bij de ingang werden tegen gehouden we mochten niet doorlopen aangezien we toeristen waren en geen moslima de wachter viel niet over te halen een andere nederlande meid die naar buiten kwam lopen en dus wel binnen was gekomen heeft ook nog een vergeefse poging gedaan uiteindelijk namen 2 aardige iraanse mannen ons mee via de bazaar naar het plein een van de mannen genaamd mirab student psychologie regelde nog dat we de kleine moskee binnen kwamen in het mannengedeelte nog wel hier lagen overal mannen te slapen via de vooringang hebben we het plein weer verlaten vond dat best spannend aangezien de man die ons ervoor had tegengehouden er nog steeds was gelukkig heeft het niets gezegd en ik heb hem niet aangekeken waar een chador al niet goed voor is mirab nam ons vervolgens met de taxi mee naar het mausoleum van de dichter hafez waar we om 16 00 met de groep hadden afgesproken bij het theehuis helaas was dit theehuis gesloten net als vele andere theehuizen de regering heeft besloten de laatste maanden veel theehuizen te sluiten aangezien er veel door jongeren waterpijp wordt gerookt soms voorzien van opium mirab heeft ons nog een rondleiding gegeven en na uitwisseling van e mailadressen is hij vertrokken op weg naar teheran waar hij woonde vroeg in de avond zijn we vertrokken met de taxi terug naar het hotel war we even hebben gerelaxed voor het diner ben ik met birgit nog even langs de verschillende shops gegaan in de winkelstraat waar ze nog wat boeken heeft gescoord het diner saladebuffet met vis deze avond was in een restaurant met live muziek wat best bijzonder is in een land als iran woensdag 9 april na een lekker ontbijtje vertrokken we om 8 00 uur met de bus naar isfahan onderweg hebben we in naghsh e rostam de 4 koningsgraven bezocht de 4 enorme graven zijn hoog in de rotsen uitgehouwen men denkt dat het de graven zijn van darius i darius ii xerxes en artaxerxes verder hebben we in de loop van de ochtend nog een tussenstop gemaakt in pasargadae hier staat de reusachtige tombe van cyrus het uizicht op een van de ruines was mooi maar verder stelde het niet heel veel voor zeker niet na een bezichtigin aan persepolis valt dit geheel in het niet wel was het lekker om weer even de bus uit te zijn en de benen te strekken rond 14 00 uur hebben we weer de door karin aangekochte sandwiches deze maal een keuze uit falaffel gefrituurde balletjes van gemalen kikkererwten en kip even werden we nog lastig gevallen door afgaanse of pakistaanse vluchtelingen iran is trouwens een land waar heel veel vluchtelingen zijn wat wil je met buurlanden als afganistan en irak in de avond ben ik met birgit nog een uurtje gelopen door de stad vervolgens zijn we met de groep iraanse pizza gaan eten dit is een wat dikkere pizza zonder tomatensaus wat flauw van smaak maar met de bijgegeven tomatenketchup en met gebruik van de zoutpot was ie erg lekker rond 22 00 nestelde ik me lekker in bed met de reisgids samen met birgit hebben we plannen gemaakt voor de volgende dag immers weer een vrije dag in isfahan rond 23 15 belande ik dan uiteindelijk in dromenland donderdag 10 april vandaag een vrije dag in isfahan dit keer hadden we geen wekker gezet maar het ritme zat er geheel in zodat we fris en fit rond 8 15 aan de ontbijttafel plaats namen ditmaal wel heerlijk de tijd genomen voor een rustig ontbijt rond 9 30 ben ik dan samen met birgit op weg gegaan naar de bazaar van isfahan hier hebben we onze fotocameras weer op volle toeren laten draaien rond de middag kwamen we karin ria en ook paul tegen en waren we wel weer toe aan een theetje in een theehuis maar ook het theehuis waar we s middags met de groep hadden afgesproken bleek ook opgeheven te zijn een iraanse man heeft ons de weg gewezen naar een van de weinige zo niet enige theehuis in de omgeving zelfs waterpijpen waren er aanwezig bij toeval kwam ook karin even later binnenlopen de theehuizen in iran zijn echt superleuk en gezellig jammer dat er zo velen gesloten zijn door de regering na even bijgekomen te zijn werden we opgehaald door de man die daarvoor ons het theehuis gewezen had hij wist een plek waar we mooi uitzicht hadden over de stad tevens heeft hij ons voorgesteld aan een man die de kruiden aan de kooplieden van de bazaar verkoopt hier hebben we uitleg gekregen over het maken van de kruiden en ik heb nog safraan draadjes kaneel en rode peper gekocht daarna volgde een bezoekje aan een tapijten winkel tevens hebben we gezien hoe de tapijten worden geweven schoongemaakt gerestaureerd en geschoren voldaan zijn birgit in ik weer met zn tweeen op pad gegaan richting de moskee deze hadden we immers nog steeds niet bezocht helaas bleek hij pas om 15 00 uur open te gaan zodat we nog even lekker op het meidam e emam een enorm plein van 163 bij 510m hier hebben we nog even in het gras gelegen de beide moskeen zijn heel bijzonder de imam moskee is een van de hoogtepunten van de islamitische architectuur in de wereld kenmerkend is het perfecte samenspel tussen het delicate kleurgebruik overheersend blauw en geel van de geglazuurde moza ektegels de bouw begon in 1611 en was voltooid in 1638 de moskee zelf ligt eigenlijk niet echt aan het plein maar erachter en onder een hoek gedraaid ten opzichte van de as van het plein dit komt omdat de moskee richting mekka wijst in iran naar het zuidwesten via een indrukwekkend ingangsportaal kom je op een aparte binnenplaats rond deze binnenplaats zijn 4 poorten waarvan n toegang geeft tot de moskee zelf tevens ligt de sheik lotfallah moskee bouw 1602 1619 aan het plein deze heeft geen minnaretten maar is heel indrukwekkend door de fraai bewerkte koepel om 16 15 zijn we weer vertrokken naar het theehuis waar we ook eerder die dag waren geweest de rest van de groep was al aanwezig en was aan de waterpijp met sinaasappel mint tabak na het nuttigen van meerder koppen thee ben ik met karin en birgit weer de bazaar ingetrokken op zoek naar een waterpijp als souvenier rond een uur of 8 waren we bij de ingang van de moskee waar we met de groep hadden afgesproken voor het diner hier hebben we nog even op een muurtje gezeten en gekletst karin had die middag voor ons gereserveerd in een traditioneel perzisch restaurant de eigenaar was de eerste die haar aansprak over the movie fitna die een paar weken geleden op internet is verschenen hij was er nogal boos over en vond dat onze koningin de film moest verbieden in iran heeft trouwens nauwelijks iemand de film gezien aangezien internet wordt gefilterd en veel internet sites niet toegankelijk zijn ook dit web log werd in iran geblokkeerd op de vraag van karin of we dan niet s avonds mochten komen eten aangezien we hollanders zijn had hij gelachen en gezegd

1303052 am cerut ministerului internelor si reformei administrative mira ultimele statistici privitoare la agresiunile asupra politistilor precum si la salarizarea din domeniu deoarece numarul agresiunilor asupra politistilor a crescut alarmant de asemenea potrivit protocolului semnat cu mira in octombrie salariul politistilor trebuia sa creasca cu 27 la suta dar a crescut doar cu trei procente
1303053 urmare a acestui fapt ca noi cerem in zadar aceste sporuri dar nu ne sunt acordate avem un deficit foarte mare de personal sunt localitati in care nu se prezinta nimeni la concurs pentru posturile vacante
1303054 avem procese cu inspectoratele judetene de politie si implicit cu mira aproape zilnic vrem sa ne plateasca sambetele si duminicile suta la suta conform legii

1303062 helpless against the destruction that can be wrought by aggressive campaigns on the internet
1303063 i talk to him all the time and thats not what i heard
1303064 i heard a man who wants to work with the united states to come up with a rational way to have the united states withdraw combat troops depending upon conditions on the ground thats all
1303065 understands the need to set aspirational goals and to make sure the conditions on the ground warrant whatever aspirational goal there is
1303066 the timetables that were being argued in the congress were being argued based upon politics not based upon conditions on the ground
1303067 i had a lot of hires in this administration a lot of parts of it
1303068 ive read the critique ive listened very seriously to what they said and other than that i have no comment
1303069 any president can make a decision with troops that he sees fit
1303070 any prime minister of iraq can decide our presence isnt necessary
1303071 i think youll find that when the agreement emerges its an agreement that has to be accepted by both parties

1303096 we hope that the results of this survey will allow us to work with the congolese government to establish and protect the new ntokou pikounda protected area
1303097 these figures show that northern republic of congo contains the mother lode of gorillas
1303098 it also shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working

1303104 compared with a peak of just 158 000 for the next most popular album of the period
1303105 the expectation among rights holders is that in order to create a success story you must reduce the rate of piracy
1303106 weve found that is not the case says garland in the story

1303138 i want to thank the health extension workers for what theyre doing
1303139 its vital that we get universal access to hiv testing so everyone can know their status and so we can prevent babies from being born with hiv
1303140 the worst thing you can do is have mixed feeding in terms of the risk of hiv transmission
1303141 where formula is an option using just that reduces transmission to its lowest rates
1303142 people are really feeling the squeeze there is definitely some strain here
1303143 you never know when youre going to need to fall back on your savings and in this respect dipping into them to meet bills such as gas bills is no bad thing
1303144 on the other hand dipping in to your isa savings could prove costly in the long term with a cash isa allowance of 3 600 per tax year any withdrawals made can not be replaced so that part of your allowance would be lost forever
1303145 together with the executive council of the russian olympic committee we decided not to include gusev in the olympic team
1303146 denis menchov will replace gusev and will compete in beijing in the time trial race together with vladimir karpets
1303147 the longer it goes on they actually draw strength from that
1303148 you have to ask what the police were trying to achieve by over presenting evidence that they did not have and clearly could not claim to have
1303149 it would appear they were seeking to apply pressure by overstating the evidence that they had and frankly it is a scandal

1303153 we had some songs but there were only about three and mark ronson wanted to work with us
1303154 we met up with him he sounds he was a funny guy and he got he had the same sort of sense of humour and we thought lets go in the studio with him and record and the recording sounded fantastic
1303155 we didnt hire mark ronson for him to make us sound like a version we hired him for 45 a day
1303156 id written out the lyrics when i went in later it said lilly allen wos here on it
1303157 the purposes of these exercises is plain to foster patriotism and provide an opportunity for students to engage in thoughtful contemplation
1303158 legislators repeatedly emphasized that students could stare at their shoes think about upcoming exams think about their pets engage in other nonverbal activities during the moment of silence as well as pray if they wished
1303159 we know that gilad schalit is alive where he is being held and by whom and i hope we can promptly bring the episode to an end

1303162 doamne eu as vrea sa te urmez tot timpul ce trebuie sa fac
1303163 the north koreans have 11 000 artillery tubes and rockets aimed at the south korean capital so any little thing that we do with north korea makes the south koreans very jittery
1303164 on the other hand the u s has to worry a great deal about where terrorists might get nuclear weapons or nuclear material
1303165 the more ive seen the more critical i see the need is for the world to pay attention to the people of burma and for the world to put pressure on the military regime
1303166 i think its best for u s chinas relations that i go i know its important for me to send a clear signal to the chinese people that we respect them
1303167 he will have to say something public which is always tricky how much he spotlights these issues
1303168 and i think he will not do it in an adversarial way
1303169 from a scientific perspective green carbon accounting and protection of the natural forests in all nations should become part of a comprehensive approach to solving the climate change problem
1303170 protecting the carbon in australias and the worlds natural forests is no longer an option it is a necessity
1303171 if natural forests continue to be cleared and degraded then the carbon dioxide released will significantly increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
1303172 to date in climate change discussions in the forest sector all the attention has been on reforestation and afforestation
1303173 at the bali climate change conference in december everybody kind of woke up and realised that natural forests store a vast amount of carbon and that we cant afford to allow further emissions from deforestation and forest degeneration because these are on top of fossil fuel burning
1303174 many of my players have been linked with other clubs but more often than not it has not come to anything
1303175 often agents tout their players around but i can honestly say there is nothing in this one michael is staying put
1303176 are plotting to seize back dominance of the petitioning system in britain and hope that the internet will prove the means to achieve their goal
1303177 oh well eat him ill have his liver with bacon and onions
1303178 we applied with the games organisers to order an extra long bed after the good luck beijing test events in april
1303179 back then all the clinical beds here were just 2 1 metres long and were very uncomfortable for the patients
1303180 of course we hope no one gets injured and all the athletes play well at the games
1303181 the iocs priority is to ensure that as many people as possible get to experience the magic of the olympic games and the inspirational sporting achievements of the olympic athletes
1303182 for the first time in olympic history we will have complete global online coverage and the ioc will have its own broadcast channel which will make fantastic olympic footage available where young generations of sports fans are already going for online entertainment
1303183 the olympic games are not that credible or relevant to most young people in the developed or developing world
1303184 its disappointing that they are not going to be there
1303185 i was looking forward to playing them but i am sure they will be back at the next games
1303186 we are feeling good the lead up has been really good
1303187 its very sad that they hockey team are not here
1303188 with regards to internet access there appears to have been last minute progress achieved
1303189 however there has been considerable damage done to us and in my part of the world what was somebody elses problem has become ours
1303190 this should not have been in the glare of press discussions in august 2008 as we have all known that this could be a problem ever since beijing were elected and we should have taken whatever steps necessary
1303191 this turned into our problem when it shouldnt have been
1303192 however the other day i was asked would i apologise and i said i would not apologise as the ioc do run the internet in china

1303205 we are still investigating the cases there are some leads which may suggest involvement of local simi workers we are still looking for concrete evidence in the cases
1303206 security for the olympic games is of paramount importance the more we give the safer and more secure the residents will feel
1303207 i heard the attack yesterday morning it was not loud it just sounded like a cars tire bursting
1303208 it doesnt seem like there are more police on the streets but the neighborhood patrols seem to be tighter theyre coming around and checking more often
1303209 in nevada theres absolutely enough to have an effect on the election
1303210 i think that you will see not just libertarians who always vote for the libertarian candidate but conservative republicans saying weve had it weve had enough and theyre going to go ahead and vote libertarian
1303211 theres little doubt bill clinton would not have won montana if it werent for ross perot
1303212 at the end of the day republicans are going to vote for john mccain hes a western candidate who understands water issues land issues hes a fiscal conservative
1303213 his message is appealing to a broad spectrum of voters
1303214 were trying to say hey you guys got to play by the rules and if you dont youll face the consequences
1303215 i do encourage all the alternatives obviously because i cant support either of the two candidates from the republican or democratic parties

1303218 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1303219 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1303220 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1303221 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1303222 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1303223 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1303224 yahoo did not participate in the execution of the votes and was not a party to any errors which may have been made either by a voting institution or a proxy processing intermediary acting on behalf of banks brokers and institutions

1303229 security for the olympic games is of paramount importance the more we give the safer and more secure the residents will feel
1303230 i heard the attack yesterday morning it was not loud it just sounded like a cars tire bursting
1303231 it doesnt seem like there are more police on the streets but the neighborhood patrols seem to be tighter theyre coming around and checking more often
1303232 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1303233 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point its focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand
1303234 but some of the issues that caused oil prices to lift have not yet been resolved
1303235 we spend money to come here with our families its an inexpensive place to stay
1303236 if they were to say evacuate then yeah we would do it but otherwise no
1303237 this is not the time of year for anyone along the texas coast to be interrupted by these storms
1303238 you hear stories about people in their homes making decisions about buying food or medications they are sitting there with no food in the house
1303239 its not necessarily always about money sometimes its just they cant get out of the house they dont know who to call who to trust a lot of medical conditions can cause them to be very confused and weak and tired
1303240 its a very nominal fee to become a member but you become part of this resource pool
1303241 churches need help with working with their seniors how to run a day care how to run a meals on wheels program
1303242 i was very excited because i think its something thats needed and long overdue
1303243 we will have a newsletter that we will send by e mail immediately we are going to make it easier for people to access information
1303244 when you get all the agencies serving seniors working together much like the childrens alliance i think you work smarter and achieve more working together than working individually
1303245 having everyone working together we see the bigger picture and better see where the gaps are and hopefully work to fill those gaps
1303246 thats one of the main reasons for this group is you have to look at the community and private funding to help make up the difference
1303247 our technology allows customers to have a complete olympics experience from the comfort of their homes
1303248 the olympics on cox is the next best thing to being in beijing for the games
1303249 the bashing in of his skull by the unharmed uninjured deputy johnny pappas was grossly unreasonable
1303250 deputy pappas used the only thing he could to stop earl hitchcock from taking that gun away a hand held radio
1303251 you cant get places to live here and we have to pay what they ask
1303252 you come home with 1 600 1 700 dollars a week so you cant grovel about 300 but you can get a house for that in queensland a good house its outrageous
1303253 infrastructure is crumbling because of the boom accommodation all these services are just crumbling health education law
1303254 they can leave and get a job with the mining boom in a resources company and housing is so poor for them so why stay and that is across the board
1303255 i predict that its probably going to get even tougher here because there are these huge projects still coming on stream
1303256 there are good things as well it gives kids a chance to get apprenticeships that are not really available in cities and farming towns
1303257 its certainly not all doom and gloom but there are certainly pressures within the town
1303258 there are currently great opportunities within the resources sector but the downside for many mine workers is that the time away from home affects their ability to form and maintain personal relationships
1303259 this would bring about a feeling of togetherness amongst the people when they take a collective stand to arrest a common threat
1303260 this looks like peppered porridge a sea of ice floes speckled with seals
1303261 bring the iphone into the same league as the nintendo ds and sony psp
1303262 we believe that the services decision to list the polar bear was not based on the best scientific and commercial data available
1303263 this lawsuit and her head in the sand approach to global warming only helps oil companies certainly not alaska or the polar bear
1303264 gov palin should be working for sustainable clean energy development in alaska instead of extinction for the polar bear

1303267 i have this unbelievably strong feeling that him sitting beside stacy had something to do with this

1303269 she said to me i dont know where he is he had to leave town it was an emergency
1303270 everyone is talking about his background how he went to church was a good guy he never gave tim a chance
1303271 mental illness or not you dont do that to another human being
1303272 our biggest concerns right now are power outages and street flooding
1303273 if your recipe calls for species to avoid consider using sustainable alternative instead
1303274 we are scared that after this things may be even harder for uighurs
1303275 it is just because it is so close to the olympics
1303276 but dont worry this doesnt affect ordinary people like you and me
1303277 the whole regions transport network must establish a dense atmosphere of secure transport and production
1303278 weapons were similar to those captured by police from an east turkestan terror camp in january 2007
1303279 i dipped my front wheel in tampa bay when leaving
1303280 i get a thrill because others get a thrill its a showstopper and folks are amazed someone is still able to ride it today

1303283 i think after the presidential election and after the first of the year youre going to see more activity than we are now
1303284 the ones that are in a position that need to buy or sell they are

1303316 for some chinese companies you could argue they need only five to 15 years to develop a global brand

1303322 you can be against israel without being anti jewish bolstering their point was a significant number of jews in leftist organisations such as the communist party and the socialist workers party hatred of israel has dropped its flimsy mask jews in france and other european countries know all too well that a jew anywhere is a target jews in buenos aires argentina learned that lesson in 1994 when its jewish center was blown up in a terrorist bombing tied to iran any pretense that a distinction exists between jews out of israel and those in the holy land has long ceased to exist yesterday was a national holiday in lebanon there was an outpouring of joy that a murderer of a four year old girl was now free in a country with an elaborate division of power between christian muslim and druse all factions of the national leadership led the nation in rejoicing among jews saying amen to a blessing is the same as saying it ones self the entire lebanese nation has declared the vilest sort of murder to be their highest aspiration through their enthusiastic celebration of samir kuntar they have said amen to his deeds and become one with them they have stood together in the light of day and sealed their judgement in the eyes of g d and man anyone who asks us to negotiate with such a nation deadens righteous revulsion and in so doing defiles the world this wicked nation to israels north spent an entire day spitting in g ds face the lebanese themselves know how malignant their hatred is of jews i found a comedy skit that pokes fun at hezbollah and its hatred of israel they openly admit that sheba farms is only the first step that jews elsewhere are fair game the very fact that such a skit can be made shows that yesterdays orgy of sick rejoicing was voluntary if this sad episode wakes up and unites the jewish people it will have served a purpose we can and must find togetherness in love that eclipses the unifying hatred of our enemies whenever someone makes a joke a part of me sits back and analyses the underlying assumptions of the joke and the reason for telling it the video i am presenting in this posting provides telling insight into the minds of the lebanese i am grateful to you tube and the person who uploaded it for providing me with such telling insight posted by magdeburger joe at thursday july 17 2008 labels arab israeli conflict my comments video content 1 comments chaim said you are right right joe no matter where we are we are always potential targets however as mark twain noted in 3 short paragraphs on the jews we will still be here long after our enemies have been destroyed by their own actions he has made a marvelous fight in this world in all ages and has done it with his hands tied behind him he could be vain of himself and be excused for it the egyptians the babylonians and the persians rose filled the planet with sound and splendor then faded to dream stuff and passed away the greeks and romans followed and made a vast noise and they were gone other people have sprung up and held their torch high for a time but it burned out and they sit in twilight now and have vanished the jew saw them all survived them all and is now what he always was exhibiting no decadence no infirmities of age no weakening of his parts no slowing of his energies no dulling of his alert but aggressive mind all things are mortal but the jews all other forces pass but he remains

1303325 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there
1303326 our troops have performed brilliantly in lowering the level of violence
1303327 iraq has met all but three of 18 original benchmarks set by congress last year to measure security political and economic progress

1303344 the number includes 30 scholars selected in 2007 8 but had to defer their admonition to the current year due to various reasons
1303345 this becomes more compelling in view of the fact that most of the phd graduates are engaged as lecturers by the universities

1303433 i think so long as oil doesnt pop higher the dollar will remain supported
1303434 admittedly oil has dropped by over 17 from its peak suggesting that the fed should be less concerned about its impact on inflation expectations
1303435 however note that the fed cut rates to 2 as insurance against a severe credit crisis the fed is likely to question if rates need to be kept so low as credit conditions stabilize
1303436 these figures will do nothing to quell fears that the economy is sliding towards negative growth and the prospect of a technical recession looks increasingly likely
1303437 what a mockery that after five years detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan

1303468 what we fail to understand what made the bjp central leadership to fuel the fire in jammu only because of elections slated in the state
1303469 it is most unfortunate that a political party claiming to form government at national level should play with the sentiments of people to meet their political ends
1303470 this attitude on the part of bjps central leadership is not understandable elections will come and go political parties will come and go but no political party should cross the lakshaman rekha to meet their political goals at the cost of unity of the state and country

1303546 i had to make sacrifices and i dream of the day some day when everyone can afford to clone their pet because losing a pet is a terrible terrible loss to anyone
1303547 as of today we are at the stage of receiving orders from anywhere in the world
1303548 i was driving to work at around 4 50 am when an animal crossed the road approximately a hundred metres ahead
1303549 at first i thought it was a black cat but the nearer i got i realised that this was too large for a domestic cat it was as large as a dog
1303550 as i was upon it it disappeared into the hedgerow on my side the most striking thing was the size and sturdiness of its tail it was tall but slender or perhaps sleek is more apt its head smallish
1303551 i know exactly what i saw but my friends have found it difficult to believe me maybe its fear of the unknown
1303552 it could be anything and it does appear hard to make out

1303557 the people posting the rumour only seem happy to have people believe it without question
1303558 we used to always think of this industry as the cycle
1303559 i think the reality now is there are several sub cycles
1303560 the people posting the rumour only seem happy to have people believe it without question
1303561 the crew on this mission is going to be teased terribly
1303562 im cautiously optimistic i suspect that the extremists on both sides will not heed the call for moratoria and will not sign on to any covenant but i think the majority will and if that means that we have a smaller communion based on humility prayer a willingness to admit that each of us sees through a glass darkly and a determination to seek the will of god together without automatically dismissing those with whom we disagree well so be it
1303563 its something of god a sign maybe to the ones that dont know god yet so they can know
1303564 our protest was very constructive and reflected the revulsion felt at the placard displayed at last years march which said jesus is a fag
1303565 its interesting the number of people who thought i was a pope
1303566 he loyally and steadfastly preaches the gospel but he doesnt shove it down our throats we get on well with david
1303567 i treat them as human beings i have debated and conversed with them but we dont condone what they do
1303568 this is the first time our banner has been displayed at pride in belfast we are here because it is important to increase our visibility and to show people that there are alternative christian views to those espoused by iris robinson
1303569 successive governments have legislated for any gay human rights issues this is a flaunting of sexuality
1303570 but mr mcilveen said there was no need for a gay pride march
1303571 the goal for our next project is something very very different so its a little scary because we dont know what it is exactly were getting a much clearer sense every single day in terms of what were doing deciding whats in and out of the game but its going to be aggressive
1303572 i actually cant talk about it without talking about the game itself
1303573 there are things related to story gameplay and i dont know how to describe it peoples relationship with the game over the long term thats what were thinking about but its about as clear as i can be
1303574 the people posting the rumour only seem happy to have people believe it without question
1303575 wed be stupid not to look at the lostwinds world
1303576 one of the problems of writing games is that youre expecting to do well because its your baby and you love it but im very pleased with what we did
1303577 it reminds me of development a long time ago where three or four months seemed like a long time

1303579 the people posting the rumour only seem happy to have people believe it without question
1303580 i think we have to make sure that what we do must be dignified and inclusive i want the civic and religious leaders to come together like we saw after the murder of anthony walker 18 who was murdered with an ice axe in a racially motivated attack in huyton in 2005
1303581 with the same robustness that they showed against racial hatred
1303582 responsibilty for the homophobia and indeed deadly violence against young gay men lies directly at the door of the pope a bavarian german with a dubious wartime past and significant nazi connections who has fomented gay hate responsibility lies also with the weak and vacillating rowan williams who seems now to be blaming homosexuals not remaining shut away in the church of england closet for the problems created by the black bishops and their fellow travellers who are falling in line with muslim gay hate and bigotry the whole area of religious duplicity simply renders religion increasingly irrelevant to the uk population as a whole gay or straight and indeed renders it beneath contempt as utterly hypocritical
1303583 your correspondent gendy states that the church in england is becoming increasing irrelevant i fear gendy is completely wrong here it is because people still listen to the stupid rowan williams and downright evil michael nazir ali pronouncements of its the homophobic leaders that young men like michael causer are still being murdered on our streets unless the church of which i am a priest starts living the gospel of its founder it would be better and safer for everybody if it did fade into insignificance a s a p

1303729 my father an intellectual started up a company after 1989 which came to nothing he couldnt understand it as he did everything the way he was told to thats what most people our age do too they do everything one is supposed to do training courses work experience and a couple of years later when they realise that nothing has changed they panic for they retain the belief that if they just make that little bit more effort then everything will work out but even if everyone were equally talented and made the same effort its not enough for everyone that is one of the biggest traps of neoliberalism
1303730 wiszniewicz doesnt comment on anything and tries not to make generalisations she allows her heroes to tell their story it is an excellent piece of oral history which is still a historical methodology viewed with distrust in poland where there is more belief in documents amongst those the documents of the communist secret police than in the spoken word the book is also simply excellent literature
1303731 since character is an unfashionable concept it is important to be clear what it means in this public policy context the three key ingredients of a good character are a sense of personal agency or self direction an acceptance of personal responsibility and effective regulation of ones own emotions in particular the ability to resist temptation or at least defer gratification progressives are realising that thus defined character is intimately linked to many of their social goals and also that it is unevenly distributed indeed inequality of character may now be as important as inequality of economic resources

1303763 campaign contributions from oil industry executives to sen john mccain rose dramatically in the last half of june after the senator from arizona made a high profile split with environmentalists and reversed his opposition to the federal ban on offshore drilling
1303764 the centerpiece of sen mccains plan to stimulate the economy actually the whole plan is large tax cuts for corporations it would deliver 3 8 billion in tax cuts to the five largest american oil companies according to an analysis released today by the center for american progress action fund
1303765 republican sen john mccain criticized sen barack obamas call for a windfall profits tax on the oil industry on tuesday despite leaving the door open to the same idea last month mccain criticized obama his democratic rival repeatedly in excerpts of a speech planned for delivery tuesday evening he cited obamas advocacy of a tax on excess oil industry profits as well as the democrats vote for president bushs energy legislation in 2005 mccain reserved his sharpest words for the windfall profits tax if that plan sounds familiar its because that was president carters big idea too im all for recycling but its better applied to paper and plastic than to the failed policies of the 1970s mccain said in the excerpts
1303766 would deliver a 3 8 billion tax cut to the five largest american oil companies
1303767 require the oil industry to use its profits to help pursue alternative energy
1303768 i would not require them to but i think that public pressure and a lot of other things including a national security requirement that we reduce and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil and we stop the contamination of our atmosphere which is and climate change which is real and is taking place
1303769 by far the sharpest debate this sunday was between john mccain and his own surrogates
1303770 since john mccain himself has been trying to have it both ways on the social security payroll tax its no surprise that his surrogates are confused about which position to defend no amount of double talk can change the fact that john mccain is promising more of the same failed policies that have left americans struggling under the failed bush mccain economy
1303771 senator mccain believes you cannot tax your way into social security solvency if you want to deal with social security youve got to deal with all the moving parts that is whether or not you allow young people to invest uh have an account in their own name do you adjust the age do you adjust reschedule the benefits based on upper income people john is not going to tax our way into solvency because it will ruin the american economy but to raise taxes to save social security from bankruptcy wont happen its a dumb idea
1303772 hes making his position very clear which is payroll tax increases are not the solution he has been consistent in that position for the last many many months even as his opponent has proposed increases in payroll taxes
1303773 last september he was forced to defend his refusal to sign a no new tax pledge offered by the conservative americans for tax reform
1303774 meeting with us last december before the primaries he declared that
1303775 no look here we are americans are hurting you know that i know that these are tough economic times do we want to raise their taxes and have the government take more of their money we cant raise peoples taxes particularly at this particular time
1303776 mccain no i have said and will say i will say that everything has to be on the table if were going to reach a bipartisan agreement
1303777 megyn kelly alright but youre waffling now tucker youre off point youre off point were talking about on a go forward basis if mccain gets in the white house is he going to raise the payroll tax might the social security tax go up is that on the table tucker bounds no megyn there is no imaginable circumstance where john mccain would raise payroll taxes its absolutely out of the question
1303778 should be no doubt about my position i am opposed to raising taxes including social security taxes
1303779 our nations local governments which are struggling with high energy costs have been at the forefront of reducing energy consumption and addressing climate change
1303780 this funding rewards the leadership already shown by local governments and comes at a crucial time as we try to wean ourselves from fossil fuels
1303781 this funding will support on the ground efforts by cities towns and states as they tackle our serious energy challenges it provides federal recognition of grassroots efforts and supports their pursuit of solutions that reduce fossil fuel emissions reduce total energy use and improve energy efficiency i truly believe that there is infinite potential in the new program
1303782 after hearing from a number of virginians concerned about higher feed prices senator warner and i wrote to the environmental protection agency to request a temporary retraction of the ethanol mandate
1303783 these increasing costs have affected the livelihoods of many in virginias key agricultural sectors and could lead to job losses
1303784 i am also concerned about the adverse effects the mandate is having on consumers
1303785 it is my hope that by temporarily lifting the ethanol mandate our poultry dairy and livestock producers will benefit from reduced feed prices and will pass those savings on to consumers
1303786 it is important that we diversify our sources of ethanol and expedite the development of advanced biofuels like switchgrass which do not compete with food and feed sources like corn
1303787 we can help all virginia farmers struggling with higher fuel and fertilizer costs by adopting a comprehensive energy policy that takes full advantage of our domestic energy assets
1303788 in order to address our nations energy crisis all options need to be on the table
1303789 but john weaver a former mccain adviser who resigned from the campaign last year said yesterday that the ad was childish that such attacks diminish mccain and that his campaign is a mockery for mccain to win in such troubled times he needs to begin telling the american people how he intends to lead us that mccain exists he can inspire the country to greatness weaver told the atlantic magazine in a comment quickly noted by the obama campaign
1303790 david winston a gop operative in washington argues that mccain has erred by issuing negative personal attacks
1303791 hes not emphasizing the contrasts that can actually help him win
1303792 ed rollins a longtime republican strategist said mccain sometimes appears frustrated and angry when he talks about obama especially when complaining that the press does not treat him fairly
1303793 yes look i got to tell you mccain made i think a mistake in his television ad in saying that obama didnt go because he couldnt take cameras you know thats arguable
1303794 why then is the arizona senator stumbling headlong with a largely dishonorable presidential campaign camoufl aging his own shortcomings by fecklessly impugning his opponents integrity and spouting what amount to outright lies as evidence we reference the mccain tv commercial blaming sen barack obama the democratic candidate for the high cost of gasoline mr mccains mendacious comment that mr obama went to the gym in germany rather than visit wounded american troops and the even more desperate claim that his opponent would lose a war in order to win the presidency such vicious nonsense nothing more than the political equivalent of drive by shootings gives the distinct impression that mr mccain is willing to destroy his own reputation for honor in order to save it and win the november election himself
1303795 of late sadly mccain is saying goodbye to all that the once bullish optimist is starting to come across as a churlish naysayer mccains presidential campaign is evolving into nonstop attacks on sen barack obama salted with distortion and innuendo after years as a media darling the candidate has taken to complaining about his opponents press coverage whats happened an infusion of political talent from the bush operation karl rove trained operatives have hijacked the straight talk express and are driving it into the mud
1303796 the straight talk express has taken a nasty turn into the gutter
1303797 the straight talk express has taken a nasty turn into the gutter sen john mccain has resorted to lies and distortions in what sounds like an increasingly desperate attempt to slow down sen barack obama by raising questions about his patriotism instead of taking the democrat down a few notches these baseless attacks are raising more questions about the republicans campaign and his ability to control his temper the most offensive line comes from mccain himself the arizona senator has repeated that obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign that is one of the more outrageous statements by a major political party candidate seeking the presidency
1303798 the mccain ads claim that obama says hell raise taxes on electricity is based on an interview obama gave to a san antonio newspaper in february in which he said what we ought to tax is a dirty energy like coal and to a lesser extent natural gas according to the obama campaign what obama was referring to in the interview was his proposal for a cap and trade mechanism that would set a limit on greenhouse gas emissions allowing entities to buy and sell rights to emit if that is the case mccain is criticizing obama for a proposal that he too supports
1303799 even some mccain allies have winced at the paris britney spot
1303800 well that certainly didnt take long on july 3 news reports said senator john mccain worried that he might lose the election before it truly started opened his doors to disciples of karl rove from the 2004 campaign and the bush white house less than a month later the results are on full display the candidate who started out talking about high minded civil debate has wholeheartedly adopted mr roves low minded and uncivil playbook
1303801 in every presidential campaign candidates of both parties will say something over the line sen john mccain has already hit a low mark
1303802 even by the elastic standards of political ads this is more than a stretch its baloney its also a marker on the path toward the kind of simplistic counterproductive demonizing that many expect will poison the fall campaign
1303803 mccains new ad claims that obama says hell raise taxes on electricity
1303804 mccains facts are literally true but his insinuation that the visit was canceled because of the press ban or the desire for gym time is false in fact obama visited wounded troops earlier without cameras or press both in the u s and iraq
1303805 long answer both mccain and obama would make electricity derived from fossil fuels more expensive since theyre both committed to setting mandatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions through a cap and trade system in fact they would raise energy costs by the same amount over the next 12 years since they have identical short term emissions goals
1303806 with airfares already sky high fewer and fewer american families are able to travel i am concerned that auctioning off flight slots in the manner proposed by the federal government could end up pricing middle class americans right out of flying at the best most convenient times of day we need an air travel system that is as fair as possible for as many people as possible it shouldnt favor business travelers over families the way that this proposal might and it shouldnt penalize you so drastically just because you happen to live in a certain part of the country
1303807 our backyards should not become junkyards for industry our towns and cities need to be able to protect their communities from fire hazards and pollution caused by waste on rail sites
1303808 i am proud we are a step closer to permanently opening the door for new jersey to clean up this waste
1303809 todays dismal report confirms that millions of working families continue to struggle to find jobs or keep their jobs earlier this summer congress passed a temporary extension of unemployment benefits but senator kennedy believes that greater action is needed to create jobs provide additional unemployment assistance and rein in runaway energy prices
1303810 with less than six months left in his term the president is on a course to commit the united states to guarantee iraqs security far into the future
1303811 this legislation makes clear that the president cannot do that without congressional approval rather than engaging in these negotiations which by the administrations admission will set the broad parameters of the u s iraq relationship the president should secure a short term agreement through the un or with iraq to provide the necessary legal protection for u s forces after the current un mandate expires at the end of the year
1303812 a strategic framework for a continued u s iraqi relationship that includes future u s security commitments and arrangements will be sustainable only with strong and broad political support in both the united states and iraq only direct involvement by and partnership with the congress will ensure a consensus of support in the united states
1303813 unfortunately the administration continues to handle long term security negotiations in the same manner that has characterized its entire approach to iraq since 2003 without congressional input
1303814 now we have no choice but to require congress to approve any u s iraq strategic agreement that includes provisions committing the united states to the defense of iraq against aggression
1303815 it is imperative that congress exercise its proper authority on the vital issue of our future relationship with iraq and on the question of whether the united states should maintain a long term presence in that country
1303816 this bipartisan legislation would ensure that any agreement with iraq would not be implemented without the explicit consent of congress and protects the constitutional responsibilities of the senate in this important national security matter
1303817 s upporting the republic of iraq in defending its democratic system against internal and external threats
1303818 security assurances and commitments to the republic of iraq to deter foreign aggression against iraq that violates its sovereignty and the integrity of its territories waters or airspace
1303819 the notion that iraqs leaders plan to submit the agreement to their parliament but our president does not makes no sense
1303820 the president cannot make such a sweeping commitment on his own authority congress must grant approval first
1303821 after over a year of negotiations i am pleased to announce an historic coalition supporting legislation to make health insurance more affordable for the 47 1 million workers in our nations small businesses and the 14 1 million self employed persons
1303822 contrary to popular belief most people who dont have insurance are not out of work in fact they work full time in small businesses that cannot afford health insurance for their workers small business owners across america are trying to do their part to help provide their employees with health insurance but they are struggling with annual double digit premium increases this bill helps solve that problem
1303823 we commend this bipartisan group of senators for supporting small business and working to address their no 1 concern the ever increasing cost of healthcare
1303824 the pooling options and tax credits outlined in this bill directly reflect on nfibs small business principles for healthcare reform helping to stabilize costs and incentivizing small businesses we will continue to work with leaders in congress to pursue new approaches to addressing the healthcare crisis that continues to burden americas job creators
1303825 for many realtors and those with families the total cost of health insurance can rival or even exceed their monthly mortgage
1303826 this bill will empower trade associations and other organizations to help guide their self employed and small business members through the process of finding coverage
1303827 with nearly 54 million americans living with disabilities today we have a responsibility to ensure they have better access more opportunities and increased independence
1303828 enacting the americans with disabilities act was a historic milestone when it was signed into law eighteen years ago but we still have more to do
1303829 i am proud to support this legislation and i commend senators harkin and hatch for their leadership on behalf of americans with disabilities
1303830 stronger consumer protections and clearer prohibitions against unfair and deceptive credit card lending practices are long overdue
1303831 the credit card industry today is rife with unfair deceptive and predatory practices the proposed rule would put an end to some of these abusive practices unless expanded however the proposed rule would leave untouched some of the most blatantly unfair credit card practices in existence today
1303832 the most immediate action we can take to reduce gas prices is to release oil from the strategic petroleum reserve
1303833 the truth is we can afford to temporarily take out oil from the reserve but americans can no longer afford the prices at the pump
1303834 this crisis requires an immediate response and you hold it in your power to authorize a release from the strategic petroleum reserve that will immediately supplement our crude oil supply and break the cycle of spiraling speculation
1303835 todays numbers give us a better sense of the scope of the epidemic in the united states and clearly point to the need for additional prevention particularly among the populations with rising rates of infections we cannot approach this epidemic with fear and stigma we cannot shy away from an honest discussion of the facts rather we must focus on using scientifically proven methods of education and prevention to ensure that we are reaching the populations most at risk for hiv particularly among african americans where rates of new infections are seven times higher than that of whites i will continue to push to devote additional resources to prevention and advocate for the creation of a national aids strategy to better coordinate our efforts to address all facets of this epidemic at the federal level
1303836 today i congratulate the men and women of the u
1303837 at the beginning of this congress i proudly gaveled the congress to order in the name of all of americas children promising to make this a childrens congress this week we have more than one reason to be honoring that pledge and be glad about that
1303838 today is a very special day in the history of the congress and for our families
1303839 im so pleased to be joined by many of my colleagues whom youll hear from shortly but i also want to thank chairman john dingell congressman bobby rush who was the author of the legislation in the house of representatives and chairman henry waxman who was a strong voice in all of this
1303840 its important to note in 2007 consumers union dubbed that as the year of the recall
1303841 and so when we sign this legislation to send to the president we will be doing so in the week we passed legislation to make college more affordable for americas families the medicare bill signed into law earlier for americas seniors and people with disabilities to have legislation passed last night under the leadership of congresswoman rosa delauro for equal pay
1303842 so these issues were about the health the education the safety of americas families and their security and this bill is the crown jewel because it was so long in coming so absolutely necessary and i want to thank all the members of congress house and senate who made this possible
1303843 but as i said it wouldnt have been possible without the experience documentation need generosity of spirit of the families who are with us today among many others who told their stories
1303844 today after we sign the legislation were going to hear from other members its a joyful day as a grandmother and a mom as ive said over and over raising a family is the most challenging task anyone can undertake doing that prepares you for anything being a mom is a job that requires you to be focused organized disciplined have good interpersonal skills know how to cook and drive take care of everything and at the same time never take your eyes off the children and so at least we should expect that the products that come to them are safe and not harmful to their health
1303845 torture has done tremendous damage to americas reputation around the world violates u s and international law and makes it harder to fight the war on terror its time to turn this page in our nations history and outlaw torture and secret detentions once and for all
1303846 this legislation is already in the intelligence authorization bill but we believe we have an obligation to ensure its passage so were introducing it as a separate piece of legislation as well we will pursue every legislative option until we finally outlaw torture and secret detentions by americas intelligence agencies
1303847 the presidents misguided interrogation policies have damaged our nations reputation and hindered our counterterrorism efforts
1303848 changing these policies has been a priority for the senate intelligence committee for two years but we have been blocked by the president and senate republicans today i join senators feinstein and hagel and other members in sending a clear signal that the u s intelligence community will not engage in torture
1303849 the bush administrations embrace of torture and secret detentions has led our country down a dark hallway
1303850 never again should the practices of our government turn so far away from the values of our people i hope these measures will help put right what has gone so badly wrong and restore the stature and goodwill and support this nation had earned around the world before this administration took office these measures are vital to cooperating with our allies and winning the war on terrorism
1303851 we are concerned that at a time when tbi is recognized as the signature wound of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan one of the most widely accepted and critical rehabilitative treatments for this injury known as cognitive rehabilitation therapy is excluded by the militarys tricare health insurance program
1303852 given the prevalence of tbi among returning service personnel it is difficult to comprehend why the militarys managed healthcare plan does not cover the very therapies that give our soldiers the best opportunities to recover and live full and productive lives
1303853 his remarkable recovery from a severe tbi has been widely cited as a powerful example of the great innovations of our military healthcare system
1303854 yet the treatment made available to mr woodruff may be denied to u s military personnel who are similarly afflicted
1303855 wounded warriors need and deserve unfettered access to this vital treatment
1303856 since brain injuries compromise physical emotional and cognitive abilities it is unethical not to treat all three domains
1303857 the human intellect is our most precious resource once the brain is injured we should spare no resources to facilitate the brains cognitive recovery
1303858 with great numbers of soldiers returning home with brain injuries we must provide a full continuum of care
1303859 the best way we can honor the life of sgt gerald cassidy is by taking steps to ensure that we never again fail our heroes returning home from battle
1303860 no soldiers who have been wounded in service for this country should have their care compromised or delayed when they return home we cannot bring sgt cassidy back but we can honor his sacrifice by resolving to do better by our men and women in uniform
1303861 with hundreds of thousands of service members returning home from iraq and afghanistan suffering from traumatic brain injuries we must ensure these heroes have access to the best care and treatment available
1303862 these combat related injuries require immediate and regular rehabilitation in order to help these service members live independent and healthy lives its deeply concerning that one of the most accepted treatments for tbi cognitive rehabilitation therapy is not covered under the militarys health insurance program i call on secretary gates to immediately address this alarming lack of coverage and provide our service members with the care they deserve

1303874 communication skills are increasingly recognized as an essential component of quality healthcare and not something thats nice but not necessary
1303875 these survey findings confirm that patients are demanding that their doctors treat them not just with medicines and procedures but with empathy and information that they understand

1303944 dont ask yourself what the world needs ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go and do that because what the world needs is people who have come alive

1303948 silhouettes come in all sizes and heights although standing the same you are aware that 36 24 36 or inches away either way makes a difference in how the silhouettes appear to you in modeling the slightest change in the position of the body can alter its meaning the short stout figure could look more slender by creating an angle which would slenderize that part of the body which is large the tall thin figure could appear average in size by straightening the the angle
1303949 the two angles formed by this zigzag line are important in considering seated positions will you look to see what kind of an angle any two of these lines form are they perpendicular to each other if so they form a right angle if the angle is less than a right angle it is acute if it is more it is obtuse the body line leg lines zigzag line for a position pleasing to the eye and for best body alignment the hip angle at the body line is at right angles to the thigh line and the knee angle at the shin line is at right angles to the thigh line there are however variations in the positions of the feet the hip knee angle changes with different height chairs the angle will be very different for various tasks you perform to improve your body positions diagram zigzag silhouette and study your body arrangements dont reach out for the chair and plunk yourself into it youll know it is there if you touch it with the back of your leg as you prepare to sit down if you sit properly you will not have to smooth down the back of your skirt always an unsightly gesture it will fall naturally into place without any fussing and your hands can be graceful sitting with knees and legs together like a prim little girl adds nothing to your attractiveness nor does crossing them in an ungainly zigzag or dangling a shoe from your toes if you like to cross your legs at the knee make sure that you keep them together for an attractive slanting line you also can simply put one foot in front of the other flat on the floor

1303981 the understanding between us and steven gerrard is important as well he is the midfielder who is passing the ball to myself and robbie and so the more training we do together the more good things we can do for liverpool

1304069 we have no idea exactly how many people with disabilities are hiv positive how many are educated about the risks of hiv aids or how many are able to access treatment
1304070 this lack of data highlights the neglect of people with disabilities and makes it extremely difficult to obtain funding or to strategically design policies and programming to reach this population the fact is that people with disabilities are dying silently of aids
1304071 if people with disabilities are left out of aids research policies and programming then we are relegating 10 per cent of the worlds population to the far margins of the aids response
1304072 disability like hiv aids disproportionately harms women and is intricately intertwined with poverty and social and economic marginalization
1304073 women with pre existing disabilities are often already dependent on caregivers whether physically economically or both contracting hiv only worsens their situation some may be punished for having the nerve to be sexually active and may lose what little social support they have this additional layer of stigma further exacerbates their poverty and marginalization

1304099 for every person on hiv treatment three new infections occur we need to intensify prevention in the long term
1304100 but we also need to expand treatment three million people in the developing world currently have access to treatment but more than twice as many need it entitlement to treatment is an entitlement to life
1304101 there is a false idea that aids is getting too much money which could be hurting other health efforts
1304102 in fact the opposite is true in countries where hiv services are provided there has been a general improvement in treatment of tuberculosis sexually transmitted infections and other illnesses
1304103 building clinics and laboratories training healthcare workers and working with ministries of health to deliver hiv programmes means stronger health systems for everyone
1304104 this should never be a question of either or but of how we can work together to benefit everyone in need it is time for collaboration not competition

1304151 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1304152 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1304153 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1304154 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1304155 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1304156 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1304157 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1304158 the letter handed over is not an answer to the offered package by world powers the letter does not mention the freeze for freeze issue

1304163 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1304164 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1304165 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1304166 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1304167 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1304168 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1304169 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills

1304172 israel displayed an excellent ear and fine false turn of phrase during the 15 or so months in the early 1990s when she sold hundreds of phony celebrity letters and a lot of filched real ones to about 30 different dealers now all these years later shes written a slender sordid and pretty damned fabulous book about her misadventures if i were a librarian i wouldnt let lee israel through the door but id certainly make sure i had her latest book on the shelves if i were an editor id sign her up to write a biography of louise brooks and not just to keep her out of trouble
1304173 the effect of this book on me was to make me like ammon shea and briefly to hate english what a choking god awful mash it is surely french is better then i recovered and saw its greatness afresh the o e d shea notes is a catalog of the foibles of the human condition shea has walked the wildwood of our gnarled ancient speech and returned singing incomprehensible sounds in a language that turns out to be our own
1304174 doris lessing once declared that fiction makes a better job of the truth than straightforward reminiscence and while that might well be true of her celebrated and semi autobiographical martha quest novels its an observation that doesnt apply at all to her latest book alfred amp emily an intriguing work that is half fiction half memoir the sketchy insubstantial first half of the book imagines what her parents lives might have been like if world war i had never occurred the potent and harrowing second half recounts the real life story of her parents and the incalculable ways in which the war fractured their dreams and psyches and left them stranded in the bush in africa eking out a meager existence on a tiny farm in rhodesia
1304175 brenda wineapple brings a scholars diligence and a novelists imagination to her account of dickinson and higginsons relationship crafting a tour de force that should delight specialists and casual readers alike the books individual strands of inquiry higginsons life dickinsons poems the letters that passed between them and the historical political and artistic contexts of the age are interesting in and of themselves but when intertwined so as to inform and strengthen each other theyre fascinating

1304396 i am quite disappointed by some of the comments made about the forthcoming
1304397 the full 3 cd version of volume 8 will have at least 16 tracks that are new to collectors up to 10 more
1304398 whilst on the subject of the supper club david faulkner says that he didnt realise that these shows were professionally filmed the sole purpose of the four shows was to film them and thus the only reason they took place at all this is certainly mentioned in clinton heylins biography of dylan
1304399 and similarly even for previously released songs who amongst dylan fans would know which exist in a usuable demo form or with different lyrics or with totally different musical arrangements again very few of us we would have been blundering around in the dark
1304400 the inclusion of recordings already officially released is a difficult one the record company cannot win those who who have already bought the soundtrack albums for the one dylan track feel swizzled those who have not or were even unaware of the recordings welcome it
1304401 perhaps the answer is for columbia records every now and then to gather these oddities and rarities together and release them on a compilation album
1304402 on the other hand i do agree that the price of the deluxe edition only available through bobdylan
1304403 its a question of when do you send notification even if you think you dont have perfect information
1304404 everybody is trying to judge us by the new standard
1304405 the fact of the matter is that everybody learned from virginia tech
1304406 pc for now is what were focusing on but there is a console future for the franchise
1304407 we havent really talked about what thats going to be but one thing were focused on as folks probably have seen in regards to mass effect on the pc whenever we do a platform choice were very definitive and very specific we dont splash it across all the platforms
1304408 typically we show our games many many times at e3 over and over again and were not this time we showed it once a while back and went dark on it purposely to get the technology and the game going its not that far off its very exciting
1304409 games that sell over three and a half million copies are not bad games
1304410 if you are any self respecting videogame player you love doom but everyones vision of doom and memories they had of playing doom and what they thought doom should be everyone had a different idea
1304411 when youre that popular you will have different opinions it was very successful for us and i love playing it even to this day and there are few games that look better still and that game came out a long time ago

1304414 one website had it listed as a vehicle based combat game but thats not what it is driving is a component of the game but its not that kind of game
1304415 were not trying to remake twisted metal or make a better version of ridge racer we really want to keep this as a first person game the elements of vehicle combat and racing help build on the foundations of that first person action game
1304416 your vehicle is an extension of your first person avatar
1304417 because of the way the world is built and the design structure of the world if theres a fun kind of gameplay element we want to explore we can make an area for that
1304418 we have bandit factions we have mutant factions we have settler factions and theres another type of controlling force that i wont talk about now
1304419 well you dont start in a little room walking down a hallway
1304420 there are customisable components to some of the weapons weapon and ammo types and there are things that you can do to your weapons but it all revolves around what that weapon brings to the combat we dont want to put a weapon in for the sake of it
1304421 i was lucky to get through it but it made me stronger and i hope wiser i had a lot of demons to fight maybe thats why this character is my favourite role so far
1304422 theres a definite theme of max fighting the devils inside theres a lot of action in this movie but theres also plenty of emotion and psychology it goes pretty deep
1304423 john moore director let me make the character much more than a one note action tough guy
1304424 sure i raise my voice get in peoples faces but i ramp up the humour too hes like a version of my character in the departed sly and cynical but also very funny thats the kind of thing people like to see me doing
1304425 first indications that the proposals from broadcasters are very good we are discussing 2014 and 2016 and broadcasters expect the economy to be improving in coming years
1304426 michigan decided it would generate more revenue for itself if it bundled all the rights together we can increase the revenue and value of corporate sponsorships by doing things outside the stadium the more we talked about that the more excited they got about it
1304427 the news report is completely false and baseless there are no such plans
1304428 the iocs priority is to ensure that as many people as possible get to experience the magic of the olympic games and the inspirational sporting achievements of the olympic athletes for the first time in olympic history we will have complete global online coverage and the ioc will have its own broadcast channel and content production facilities the iocs channel will make fantastic olympic footage available where young generations of sports fans are already going for online entertainment and will complement the footage offered in these territories by our broadcast partners across all media platforms
1304429 seeking a new sponsor for the ifa premiership the irish football association had discussions with many companies over the course of the last six months and a number of offers were made to the association
1304430 whilst the ifa wanted to attract a valued and reputable company it was also important to the association that any potential sponsor would have a keen interest in sport and northern ireland the association was therefore thrilled to learn of jjb sports interest in the sponsorship opportunity
1304431 waking up to the green of your eyes is something ill get used to
1304432 compared to a decade ago there are 3 million more people in work in britain and they all enjoy more employment rights than they would have in the past important minimum standards on wages paid leave maternity leave and conditions have been put in place
1304433 however as the forum found there are still dark corners of the labour market where rogue employers seek to mistreat their workers and more needs to be done to safeguard peoples rights
1304434 we want to prevent unscrupulous employers who undercut honest competition and prey on people who are fearful or so desperate to earn a living that they are open to exploitation
1304435 it is vital we boost awareness of employment rights and ensure those rights are properly enforced there should be no hiding place for employers who exploit vulnerable workers and who are not prepared to obey the law
1304436 this is in the interests of workers themselves and as was made clear by business representatives on the forum it is in the interests of the reputable businesses who treat their workers fairly and obey the law
1304437 an opportunity has been missed to address the legal and regulatory flaws which keep 2 million workers in conditions which shame a modern economy
1304438 with new eu moves on agency working and working time and changes on migrant domestic worker visas these are worthwhile changes won by union campaigning that will make a real difference to many vulnerable workers whose employers are breaking employment law
1304439 but there are also gaps it is disappointing that ministers are not prepared to extend the coverage of the gangmasters licensing authority gla to other vulnerable sectors such as construction care and hospitality
1304440 nor has the government been prepared to examine the legal loophole that deprives many workers from gaining the legal status of an employee which stops their entitlement to many rights and allows an employer to sack them with no comeback if they attempt to enforce the limited rights they enjoy
1304441 i am at a loss to understand the opposition to the licensing of gangmasters in the construction industry we have produced a wealth of data that highlighted the endemic abuse of vulnerable workers by gangmasters in our industrial sector
1304442 the report is entirely consistent with what labour said at the national policy forum in both cases we do not propose to extend licensing to the construction sector but of course we will continue to look at the evidence in the future
1304443 long campaigned for better enforcement which is in the interests of law abiding businesses as well as potentially vulnerable workers
1304444 there is extensive regulation on the employment agency sector but these rules mean nothing if they are not effectively enforced
1304445 these proposals will help tackle the minority of cases where the rights of workers are not respected

1304479 its disappointing that i have not made the main squads i feel that i am good enough
1304480 i think i have been playing well in the county championship the pro40 league and in the twenty20 cup and i deserve a little bit more than this
1304481 i have to make the most of this chance and hopefully show the selectors what i can do
1304482 we must have a team at the 2012 games and we will have a team
1304483 the impact of a british team on the public and their support of the games will be enormous
1304484 we would also expect a british team to be strong medal contenders and thereby generate tremendous excitement throughout the country
1304485 the idea of seeing a british football team is something i feel very excited about
1304486 it would be a great thing and while we are proud of our individual traditions as home nations coming together for this one off event to play together as great britain is something i believe the public would enjoy
1304487 i just hope we can overcome any differences and bring a strong british football team to the london olympics
1304488 the ioc would be delighted to see a british football team participating in the olympic games
1304489 we are hopeful that a solution will be worked out between the national associations the boa and fifa for london 2012
1304490 as the fifa president has stated on several occasions a british olympic football team would not affect at all the privileges of the four british associations as members of fifa
1304491 if you start to put together a combined team for the olympics the question will automatically come up that there are four different associations so how can they play in one team
1304492 if this is the case then why the hell do they have four associations and four votes and their own vice presidency
1304493 this will put into question all the privileges that the british associations have been given by the congress in 1946
1304494 we always said we had an open mind about it on the proviso that there would be some kind of meaningful statement from fifa
1304495 that hasnt happened so lord moynihan can huff and puff as much as he likes
1304496 i had assumed the boa would respect our position but that doesnt seem to be the case whats the point of cobbling together a team for a one off event
1304497 and its fair to say that i dont think its very helpful for us to hear all this through the media
1304498 we have a board who have looked at it and the vote was that we dont want to take part
1304499 football is autonomous for the home nations we have our own leagues and our own international teams
1304500 the olympics is not a major football event but people might use it to tell us we have to compete as great britain in other tournaments
1304501 we remain totally opposed to any welsh involvement in a great britain side at the olympics
1304502 the fa is in favour of a gb football team for the london olympics in 2012
1304503 as hosts a gb team would automatically qualify for the competition and we feel it is very important to take part when the games are in our own country ideally wed like to be part of a team represented by all four home nations

1304511 you can get the universal treatment the moneys there now if we spend it most effectively
1304512 but we dont have the health care systems to reach out to people get them tested and diagnosed in a timely fashion get them on treatment and do the regular follow ups
1304513 to pretend we can ever get a hold of this without dealing with that the idea of unprotected sexual relations with unlimited numbers of partners i think would be naive

1304544 triangles dividend continues to pace well ahead of our original expectations with over 41 million of new investments completed in the second quarter we are optimistic about the prospect of additional dividend growth during the second half of 2008

1304554 what were seeing here is a clear pattern of repeated violations of patient medical records and patient confidentiality by ucla
1304555 whats startling to us is as we get to a point where we feel weve addressed a specific complaint and a specific issue we identify additional issues
1304556 ucla should have detected the violations by ms jackson years ago and should have immediately initiated the process to dismiss her
1304557 all other employees who were found to have violated patient confidentiality during our review have been disciplined including some who have been terminated
1304558 on behalf of the entire leadership of the ucla health system i am deeply sorry for this failure and the personal distress these breaches may have caused
1304559 californians have every right to expect their medical records to be safeguarded and protected and i am alarmed about repeated violations of patient confidentiality and the potential harm to the citizens of this state
1304560 by putting financial penalties in place for those employees and facilities that do not follow these laws this legislation will lead to better care for all californians

1304636 the purpose of this local public consultation is to obtain views on post office ltds proposals to ensure that the branches that are ultimately selected for closure are appropriate
1304637 from the outset of the network change programme post office ltd has made it clear in its communications that the programme is not designed to provide a forum for debate on whether branches should close
1304638 it is about ensuring that post office ltd has the best available knowledge to allow it to make the most informed decisions about which branches should close
1304639 it is important that this happens in a way that minimises customer inconvenience and confusion that means post office ltds decisions must be sensible and public consultation meaningful our priority is to ensure this is the case
1304640 this is a win win situation for the city and surrounding area a project of this magnitude will certainly stimulate the local economy and nicely compliments existing tourism destinations such as the seneca allegany casino amp hotel allegany state park and ellicottville

1304697 olympiacos is a challenge for me i know i will be here for two years
1304698 ive had two weeks of pre season training with liverpool and i believe i will be ready to do whatever i have to
1304699 olympiacos are a great team who challenge for every honour in greece and in the champions league
1304700 the team has some good players a well known coach and fanatical supporters which always inspires them
1304701 many of my players have been linked with other clubs but more often than not it has not come to anything
1304702 often agents tout their players around but i can honestly say there is nothing in this one michael is staying put
1304703 i was always mature for my years because of the parental part of it ive seen up close what effect those things can have i would never want to put myself in that situation it would be very careless and just not smart at all

1304706 i thought there we go hes on time the fact of the matter is that jesus kept his word i experienced a miracle
1304707 why because without him at my side i would never have managed to survive the pain
1304708 being a hostage places you in a situation of constant humiliation faced with this you can take one of two possible paths either you allow yourself to become ugly and bitter filled with hate and vindictiveness or you follow the other path that is shown by jesus
1304709 he jesus said bless your enemies each time i read the bible i felt those words were directed at me as though jesus were standing in front of me he knew what to say to me
1304710 of course i realised that when your enemy is awful it is hard to live out those words faithfully and therefore i felt like saying the exact opposite when i said these words however it was like magic i felt a kind of relief the hatred simply vanished i feel that a transformation took place within me and i owe that change to being able to listen to what god wanted for me it was a constant dialogue with the gospels
1304711 at the start of my captivity i said to myself you are going to be here for months and months so you might as well read the bible which i had not done previously
1304712 when i read that i exclaimed my god i know what i want to be free
1304713 later i understood that i had to thank god for taking him because my father would never have been able to endure those six years of suffering
1304714 i was listening to radio maria the international catholic radio station and i discovered that june is the month dedicated to the sacred heart so i said this prayer my jesus i have never asked anything of you because i am so ashamed of your greatness i am simply too ashamed to ask but now i am going to ask you for something very specific i do not know exactly what it means to consecrate oneself to the sacred heart but if you tell me during the month of june i will be all yours
1304715 i thought there we go hes on time the fact of the matter is that jesus kept his word i experienced a miracle
1304716 by being faithful to our calling as husbands and fathers
1304717 there are a few issues that are of extreme interest to us as catholics and knights
1304718 why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders they do not wash their hands when they eat a meal

1304806 compared to a decade ago there are 3 million more people in work in britain and they all enjoy more employment rights than they would have in the past important minimum standards on wages paid leave maternity leave and conditions have been put in place
1304807 however as the forum found there are still dark corners of the labour market where rogue employers seek to mistreat their workers and more needs to be done to safeguard peoples rights
1304808 we want to prevent unscrupulous employers who undercut honest competition and prey on people who are fearful or so desperate to earn a living that they are open to exploitation
1304809 it is vital we boost awareness of employment rights and ensure those rights are properly enforced there should be no hiding place for employers who exploit vulnerable workers and who are not prepared to obey the law
1304810 this is in the interests of workers themselves and as was made clear by business representatives on the forum it is in the interests of the reputable businesses who treat their workers fairly and obey the law
1304811 an opportunity has been missed to address the legal and regulatory flaws which keep 2 million workers in conditions which shame a modern economy
1304812 with new eu moves on agency working and working time and changes on migrant domestic worker visas these are worthwhile changes won by union campaigning that will make a real difference to many vulnerable workers whose employers are breaking employment law
1304813 but there are also gaps it is disappointing that ministers are not prepared to extend the coverage of the gangmasters licensing authority gla to other vulnerable sectors such as construction care and hospitality
1304814 nor has the government been prepared to examine the legal loophole that deprives many workers from gaining the legal status of an employee which stops their entitlement to many rights and allows an employer to sack them with no comeback if they attempt to enforce the limited rights they enjoy
1304815 i am at a loss to understand the opposition to the licensing of gangmasters in the construction industry we have produced a wealth of data that highlighted the endemic abuse of vulnerable workers by gangmasters in our industrial sector
1304816 the report is entirely consistent with what labour said at the national policy forum in both cases we do not propose to extend licensing to the construction sector but of course we will continue to look at the evidence in the future
1304817 long campaigned for better enforcement which is in the interests of law abiding businesses as well as potentially vulnerable workers
1304818 there is extensive regulation on the employment agency sector but these rules mean nothing if they are not effectively enforced
1304819 these proposals will help tackle the minority of cases where the rights of workers are not respected

1304851 from my point of view if this bond measure fails im almost certain we will have to reorganize our services and the level of emergency care would not be at the level it is now
1304852 the only thing we have in hand is the existing site
1304853 putting a whole new facility on an alternative site requires a whole new community effort
1304854 what we are experiencing is a continual increase in the expenses to maintain and repair the equipment and as time passes the chance of catastrophic failure increases
1304855 the infrastructure is old and in need of replacing and upgrading
1304856 with the budget cuts clearly there is belt tightening going on but we dont have any significant programmatic changes going on
1304857 i dont think as we open the doors there is going to be a significant noticeable difference
1304858 we are using the reserve as its designed to get us through the rainy day today is the rainy day
1304859 we are very fortunate in petaluma to have a reserve to continue our programs without any disruption
1304860 we do not make it a practice to do that
1304861 whereas in years past we might have been a little more liberal in terms of offering sections
1304862 because no schedule is perfect that means you are going to have some very large classes

1304864 it does not appear to be similar to what we had back in june
1304865 knowing that it worked in switzerland is one of the reasons we looked at it
1304866 probably a workable solution and seems to have momentum behind it
1304867 foreign net sales of u s treasury notes and bonds was 9 4 billion compared with net purchases of 24 7 billion in june
1304868 the july report on net long term securities investment points to a fairly sharp reduction in overseas demand for u s treasury and government agency securities early in the third quarter
1304869 bonds and government agency securities market conditions deteriorated further in august including a further sharp increase in risk aversion so it is highly likely that we will see another month of relatively weak overseas demand when the august data is released next month
1304870 capital inflows are in for a bumpy ride for the next few months because of a sharp increase in investor risk aversion a tenuous overall situation that is being compounded by concerns about the strength and sustainability of the u s business expansion and the direction of federal reserve policy

1304872 fixing process based on the prices presented by market makers on november 28th then they can agree to settle with each other for cash and no delivery of bonds on december 12 but here is the rub based on most swap contracts if the buyers do not deliver to the sellers the bonds then the contract does not have to be paid consequently in this case many sellers with large losses could demand physical delivery and this would generally be the right move this would make the buyers who are technically short the bonds have to buy them at any price in the street to get their money or not at all this would cause the bonds to trade much higher and limit the cost of the sellers settling their contracts further it is the right move based on the historic prices of bankrupt companies see below according to reports this same problem occurred in a less severe way for the delphi bonds and bonds traded from the 50s to the 70s before falling back they are currently 104 see below as a bond dealer we would recommend that sellers of credit default swap insurance seriously consider taking the bonds in settlement for their contracts rather than a settlement price at a point in time shortly after a bankruptcy when market prices for the bonds tend to remain depressed the general tendency for bankrupt bonds is to trade higher in the next year after the bankruptcy this is for two reasons first the company tends to become stable and starts to have a positive cash flow and the value of it as a going concern tends to rise second the management is often changed and new players enter the picture with more positive business plans i read the article have any idea of minimum balance to open an institutional acct in credit swaps im owner of an institution

1304887 the individual market really is the worst place to buy insurance
1304888 people cant band together to take advantage of greater bargaining power in groups and as a result of that they pay more to get less
1304889 by limiting product flexibility wed also be limiting the affordability and access to coverage
1304890 it is quite difficult to understand all the provisions limitations and features of policies
1304891 we need to make the insurance market more user friendly
1304892 the benefit of screening at this time is uncertain and if there is a benefit its likely to be small
1304893 and on the other side the risks are large and dramatic
1304894 we felt with sufficient certainty that your risk of being harmed exceeded your potential benefits starting at age 75
1304895 we believe that the services decision to list the polar bear was not based on the best scientific and commercial data available
1304896 this lawsuit and her head in the sand approach to global warming only helps oil companies certainly not alaska or the polar bear
1304897 gov palin should be working for sustainable clean energy development in alaska instead of extinction for the polar bear

1304907 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1304908 we knew for a while that all the interrogations and questioning was being recorded and that that was the routine
1304909 we sent a total of three teams and it was common knowledge that all the interviews with the detainees were videotaped and recorded
1304910 the value we saw was that these guys would know their nationals and could get information better than we could
1304911 we were pretty green in this area at that time we also wanted to know what was going on in the room because we were on the hook for the well being of everyone that came in there
1304912 i think she ditched me and then julie heiden and her husband said they would bring me home but we just got to their truck and someone broke into it they have to stay and wait for the police
1304913 there were four palestinians who were issued visas about whom we then received additional information
1304914 we decided that we needed to take a closer and harder look at them in light of the additional information we received

1304961 it became much more important to make all these choices as a witting conscious consumer of life
1304962 and deeper than that there was a sense that if you did follow a traditional route

1304977 and you dont know if theyre really playing for us or they just want to go play
1304978 right now its going to be fly by the seat of our pants and hope we dont freeze to death i guess

1304990 for example to package things here the best way would be to have a facility thats protected against flies you know but here we dont have that
1304991 hes a fantastic player and an important player for us
1304992 i hope he can score a lot of goals for liverpool and that i can play alongside him many times
1304993 weve only been training together for a few days so its not a lot of time but the important thing for me is that he is always talking during games steven gerrard is important as well he is the midfielder who is passing the ball to myself and robbie and so the more training we do together the more good things we can do for liverpool
1304994 it was perfect to score my first goal because thats always important for strikers ive only been training for one week and so its understandable to feel tired

1305019 we had no idea that these great densities that is numbers per square kilometer of the gorillas were possible in central congo

1305026 ebola has resulted in dramatic local declines in gorilla populations in congo and gabon in the last two decades with population crashes of more than 95 percent being recorded
1305027 given the long life spans and slow reproductive cycles of great apes recent estimates suggest it may take up to 120 years to recover from population crashes of this magnitude
1305028 these important gorilla populations of 125 000 individuals are adjacent to areas that are known to have been impacted by ebola outbreaks in recent years

1305051 as our data shows in these current market conditions more people are struggling to meet their mortgage payments and it is vital that firms treat them fairly
1305052 this means paying attention to their individual circumstances and not repossessing their homes when there may be an alternative solution repossession has to be the last resort
1305053 we call on the fsa to take urgent action on the findings of their research if the worst consequences of the deepening mortgage crisis are to be avoided
1305054 we believe this should involve strengthening the rules on mortgage arrears and lending practices we also call on the government to introduce a mortgage pre action protocol as soon as possible to ensure that lenders only take possession action as a last resort

1305121 punk rock was just so unpopular at that time especially in pembrokeshire where being a young famer was the in thing
1305122 we got better more adept at playing the instruments and started to develop a following in the area in wales and beyond
1305123 there was a lot going on in wales in punk rock there were the partisans the solider dolls and the oppressed eight or nine bands
1305124 unfortunately at the time there was also a violent undercurrent which would manifest itself at our gigs
1305125 punk was dead if you pitched up to play a gig you would be lucky to get 20 people
1305126 bands like rancid and green day were the key for us
1305127 their fans started to look at what had gone before and wanted to know more about their influences
1305128 in bratislava about 500 kids turned up really getting into what we were doing
1305129 theres this bunch of old guys up there and they didnt care
1305130 whats great is i can honestly say ive not seen a punch thrown since we reformed its not like it was before
1305131 next year we are touring the east coast of america and all our stuff is being released over there on vinyl
1305132 it would be nice to play a few more of the indie festivals over here especially in wales but we dont get asked because people think well say no
1305133 we believe the culprit is known to mr ivey and that this is not a random attack
1305134 extensive inquiries are being carried out in relation to searching the area conducting house to house inquiries viewing cctv footage and carrying out forensic examinations
1305135 it is likely that the culprit would have been blood stained when he left the scene and we also have reason to believe that he might have travelled to the sarn and bryncethin areas shortly after the incident
1305136 i wish to reassure the people of maesteg and the wider bridgend community that we are doing everything we can to trace the person responsible
1305137 we are supporting local communities in maesteg providing reassurance to those who are understandably shocked by what has happened

1305140 i looked through the window but couldnt see anything it was too dark
1305141 i heard a row with dogs and people fighting at about a quarter past two i didnt go out to look
1305142 they were friendly going down the street then they were arguing among themselves when they came back up it sounded like the same voices they were right under the window
1305143 i didnt hear any fighting but there were loud voices
1305144 i didnt know anybody had been killed until i stepped out of the door in the morning and saw the police tent
1305145 its normally a quiet area weve had nothing like this before its a nice little spot really

1305155 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1305156 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1305157 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1305158 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1305159 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1305160 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1305161 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1305162 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1305163 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1305164 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1305165 it is not too late for our close cousins the primates and what we have now is a challenge to turn this around
1305166 we found one person and brought him to hospital but he was later confirmed dead the spokesman said adding that rescue workers were still searching for the remaining missing four
1305167 people should not touch it or attempt to pick it up by the tail as these snakes do bite said inspector dave coleman of kent police
1305168 we believe the snake will be looking for a damp dark and warm location and as it had been recently fed it will be fairly lethargic they are also excellent swimmers he said
1305169 drivers across the country can fight rising gas prices by simply maintaining proper tire inflation tires that are underinflated by just six to seven psi can reduce vehicle fuel economy by as much as 2 percent and tire tread wear can also be reduced by as much as ten percent
1305170 tire experts speculate that 2 8 billion gallons of gas are wasted annually by u s drivers simply because theyre driving on underinflated tires
1305171 in addition that same 2 8 billion gallons wasted result into 56 billion pounds of carbon dioxide released into the environment
1305172 we can all help prevent this by making sure our tires are properly inflated
1305173 people can find the tires proper inflation level on the vehicle placard located in the driver side door jamb in the glove box or in the owners manual
1305174 the external environment has deteriorated and the consequences of this for northern rock are increased credit losses
1305175 in common with many other banks because of the very difficult situation we have seen over the last year and that difficult situation is going to continue for a while yet northern rock needs more share capital
1305176 it doesnt have shareholders now that its owned by the government so its got to come to us so what weve said is that we will put in up to 3 billion
1305177 this capital restructuring will be finalized following a further review of the plan and subject to approval by the european commission of the application for state aid
1305178 new lending in the first half of the year was below the levels anticipated in the plan reflecting the slowdown in the housing market and a cautious approach to the quality of lending that northern rock is pursuing
1305179 we will do everything possible to ensure the market is as vigorous as possible to ensure prices do go down mr bowen said
1305180 workably competitive but restricted by factors such as limited incentives for price competition between the major players coles and woolworths
1305181 we think economic factors and our customers shopping preferences should determine the location of our supermarkets not additional regulation that creates more red tape coles managing director ian mcleod said

1305183 security for the olympic games is of paramount importance the more we give the safer and more secure the residents will feel
1305184 i heard the attack yesterday morning it was not loud it just sounded like a cars tire bursting
1305185 it doesnt seem like there are more police on the streets but the neighborhood patrols seem to be tighter theyre coming around and checking more often
1305186 we are sorry for the incident and the damage to the equipment that belonged to the reporters
1305187 i think about this every day soon we will travel to bulgaria i want to bring there toys and to give to these children a little love
1305188 i saw the children in bulgaria some of them are also blind and disabled with difficulties in their education their parents dont want them
1305189 i and peter we want to go to the orphanage but there is a long organization beforehand
1305190 we are aware that sculthorpe is available but i am not sure about whether or not we will go for him yet i will have to think about it and talk it over with some other people
1305191 but what i will say is that you cant ignore class you should never ignore a champion athlete and scully is undoubtedly one of those
1305192 as for those four players that we have been linked with none of them will be coming to salford
1305193 i think ben rogers is staying in australia liam colbon and graeme horne are going somewhere else and nick scruton is staying at leeds
1305194 we have four overseas players signed up for next season in ray cashmere craig stapleton phil leuluai and john wilshere so we have room for four more
1305195 we have already identified some that we want to sign and our director of football steve simms has been going through three batteries a day as he receives calls from player agents overseas
1305196 but we can afford to be patient as most of the super league clubs have already done their overseas business for next year ourselves and celtic are the only clubs with a number of quota spots available
1305197 this years squad is not up to playing in super league so we need to let some players leave and bring in others of a higher calibre but most of the players here are good enough to play in super league so were looking to make no more than 10 signings

1305476 i have no doubts in my mind that at its core and for everything that it provides that fallout is a better game than oblivion was for sure

1305486 as our data shows in these current market conditions more people are struggling to meet their mortgage payments and it is vital that firms treat them fairly
1305487 this means paying attention to their individual circumstances and not repossessing their homes when there may be an alternative solution repossession has to be the last resort
1305488 we call on the fsa to take urgent action on the findings of their research if the worst consequences of the deepening mortgage crisis are to be avoided
1305489 we believe this should involve strengthening the rules on mortgage arrears and lending practices we also call on the government to introduce a mortgage pre action protocol as soon as possible to ensure that lenders only take possession action as a last resort

1305494 two of the tracks were released as an a and a b side single but the most interesting part of the tape is where the group are trying to record the song i follow the sun
1305495 its interesting because at this part of the tape the group are trying to record it but they just cant complete it because theyre too busy giggling and laughing the group are interacting with each other and you can clearly hear paul mccartney and john lennon accusing each other of making each other laugh and they just stop and start and its just really a nice insight into early beatles when they were happy and jolly with what they were doing in their work

1305522 i was sitting having a beer and you could hear the noise of the engines coming down the road they pulled into the car park and were showing off revving and red lining their engines
1305523 they were in the bar downing pints of cider and bragging about how they had been racing and one of them had got the car up to 160mph
1305524 they were all in ties and suits like they had been to a wedding reception
1305525 i left on my bike and they came screaming past then three of the cars flew back obviously because the road was blocked by the crashed lambo they were driving extremely fast and dangerously
1305526 then i came across the car lying in the middle of the road there were people standing round it taking bits off and sitting in it

1305557 im sure lewis wasnt happy about being pipped at the start in hungary and i think there was a point when he thought hang on this is now looking a little bit worrying because on qualifying pace he should have been able to hound the ferrari but he couldnt get close
1305558 you start to get worried when things are not going according to plan and then of course he got the puncture
1305559 he said before the race im not counting any chickens and getting ahead of myself but im absolutely certain he thought it was in the bag
1305560 we think we should go ahead with it and there were three aspects discussed in the meeting two of them openly which is safety and financial implications and the other one underlying the picture is competitiveness as you would expect
1305561 our point of view is that it is good not just for bmw but for the sport and if it is good we should have it as soon as possible
1305562 no technical project has become cheaper by delaying its introduction so if we delayed it by another year we would spend the same money without putting it on stage and there is no sense at all
1305563 it is clear that we have to get the safety issues out of the way and we definitely will not race it until it is achieved we are confident to achieve that safety and i dont see any other reason for a delay
1305564 there were two or three against the delay but we want to carry on with what we are doing
1305565 i dont think they were particularly massa had a good race but kimi raikkonen wasnt particularly strong
1305566 really the outcome of the first corner was that people could see massa in the lead and who was in second place but we switched into fuel strategy mode to make sure that we stopped second to him in order that we could do a long second stint and overtake him at the final stop
1305567 the slightly flat spotted tyre and the puncture put paid to that strategy but i think that lewis had the pace to win

1305612 we found one person and brought him to hospital but he was later confirmed dead the spokesman said adding that rescue workers were still searching for the remaining missing four
1305613 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1305614 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1305615 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1305616 it is not too late for our close cousins the primates and what we have now is a challenge to turn this around
1305617 if events develop according to the worst case violence scenario russia will not allow itself to remain indifferent considering that russian citizens live in south ossetia particularly in the conflict zone
1305618 if events continue to develop in this way if the attitude is not changed this wont lead to anything good
1305619 i dont want to make any grim predictions but if such events are repeated the situation may spiral out of control and lead to sad consequences
1305620 hes a fantastic player and an important player for us
1305621 i hope he can score a lot of goals for liverpool and that i can play alongside him many times
1305622 weve only been training together for a few days so its not a lot of time but the important thing for me is that he is always talking during games steven gerrard is important as well he is the midfielder who is passing the ball to myself and robbie and so the more training we do together the more good things we can do for liverpool
1305623 it was perfect to score my first goal because thats always important for strikers ive only been training for one week and so its understandable to feel tired
1305624 the idea is to arrive fit and ready for the start of the
1305625 kevin pietersen now stands at a crossroads in his life as well as his career
1305626 being england captain will take up more time than he can imagine and he will need to reconsider his whole outlook
1305627 within the game worldwide he has a reputation as being an individual but to be successful a leader must be a giver not a taker to his team fringe players sponsors the public everyone
1305628 these would be great results in any year this year they are exceptional
1305629 we have a strong and sustainable business guided by a clear and consistent strategy and we enter the second half in good shape
1305630 to come together and share a little bit and hopefully develop closer bonds with foreign militaries in a non combat type setting
1305631 originally when i was given the opportunity i thought it would be kind of a neat way to see poland but then i started doing research on the black madonna and the siege and i thought its part of a much bigger thing
1305632 its pretty neat to be taking part in this and help improve relations with poland and other countries that are here
1305633 play is precisely a breaking off from labour and a recuperation for labour
1305634 why should others be denied the chance to remedy their deficiency
1305635 well i would not consider the way i coach spoon feeding
1305636 were going to jam it down their throats and see what they retain and then were going to give it to them again over and over its sort of the idea that you throw it up on the wall and see what sticks regather it and throw all the information back up there
1305637 but were putting in more things on the first day than we did last year thats just the normal way you do things the longer youre at a program
1305638 i think everyone whos ever played college football remembers that first day
1305639 the closer its getting im getting more excited you look around the country well probably be one of the bigger games that day if we play well in that game i think we can kind of set the tone for the season

1305648 the reason why uk forces were not deployed initially on the ground was we were simply not asked the reason we were not asked was because the iraqi prime minister nouri al malikis own credibility was on the line

1305667 he is a great kid and a great student we clocked him running a 4 9 in the 40 so obviously he can go and with the way he moves if they want to use him as an end or a tackle they are getting an unbelievable player
1305668 were ecstatic for dan i went out and bought spartan t shirts already its just an unbelievable dream
1305669 but i cant tell you how dedicated he is to both his studies and physique he works out practically everyday

1305673 i started out on a line with top forwards saku koivu and chris higgins got pushed back in the lineup and then all of a sudden i was out of the lineup
1305674 to be honest i still dont know what happened all i ever heard from the coaches was shoot the puck work hard it will all work out but
1305675 i mean you dont want people to think you lost it and cant play that gives you some motivation probably

1305681 i think it was grade 6 when i said to him michael maybe you should put down something else you know it might not happen
1305682 we knew he was really good and you always hope for the best for your child but we figured here in bonavista everything is so small what chance do you have realistically
1305683 every time ive had him hes had a good year
1305684 when he came to hull he had a lot to learn eh because in bonavista he really hadnt played much he had a lot to learn
1305685 i had to bench him for the third period in shawinigan
1305686 like i say he had to learn thats all he was just a kid after two periods he hadnt broken a sweat he wasnt lazy hes never been lazy he just had to get the message
1305687 hey players dont have to like you they just have to understand
1305688 did i have a bad game apparently i try to block it all out
1305689 what i like about claude is that he knows how to get every inch out of every player
1305690 its what he does well even in junior we didnt have the most talented team but we beat teams just by working hard

1305723 alguien tendr que reflexionar qu est pasando en la agricultura valenciana puesto que la ca da de este tipo de inversi n se da especialmente en la comunitat en las zonas hortofrut colas y no tanto en las cerealistas
1305724 el envejecimiento de esta flota es causa fundamental de la inseguridad e influye en muchos de los accidentes laborales que se producen en el campo
1305725 ni siquiera se lleg a cubrir el presupuesto auton mico asignado para tal fin

1305729 tendr que liderar el fin de este proyecto que aplica la derecha en el que se utiliza a los valencianos y valencianas como conejos de indias de la conversi n neocon a la que se deriva la comunidad valenciana
1305730 lejos de entrar en qui n o qui nes deben liderar nuestro partido estamos centrados desde esta plataforma constituida por cientos de hombres y mujeres socialistas desde castell n valencia y alicante en configurar un dise o propio del nuevo socialismo en la comunitat
1305731 no supone un momento de confrontaci n interna porque el adversario para los socialistas es el mismo que para el resto de valencianos y valencianas la prepotencia del pp que se cree due o y se or de nuestra comunitat

1305734 wij 16e dat bewijst nog maar eens dat jullie er geen verstand van hebben
1305735 natuurlijk zijn we optimistisch als we dat niet zouden zijn kunnen we beter meteen stoppen
1305736 we hebben een stabiele ploeg en onder plaats zes moeten wij voor niemand onderdoen wij gaan zeker niet zakken
1305737 arguably risks undermining the rights of fair trial for the individuals concerned
1305738 we are unconvinced that the government have properly thought through this aspect of their proposed scheme
1305739 there is a risk that this will be perceived to undermine the independence of the judiciary
1305740 conflating the roles of parliament and the judiciary which would be quite inappropriate

1305747 i need to dress so they know i mean business
1305748 these people at public works are pampered just look at them not dirty enough at the end of the day and several of them actually took a lunch break last year
1305749 all i can say is that this will teach them for being unionized

1305767 qs az zukhruf 55 56 yakni kami menjadikan mereka sebagai salaf yaitu orang yang terdahulu agar orang orang sesudah mereka dapat mengambil pelajaran dari mereka salaf oleh karena itu fairuz abadi dalam
1305768 salaf juga berarti orang orang yang mendahului kamu dari nenek moyang dan orang orang yang memiliki hubungan kekerabatan denganmu
1305769 rasyid bin saad mengatakan dulu para salaf menyukai kuda jantan karena kuda seperti itu lebih tangkas dan lebih kuat
1305770 sangat bagus sekali doa para salaf sebagaimana dikatakan al auzai rahimahullah taala orang orang keluar untuk melaksanakan shalat istisqo minta hujan kemudian berdirilah bilal bin saad dia memuji allah
1305771 sebaik baik manusia adalah generasiku kemudian generasi sesudahnya kemudian generasi sesudahnya lagi
1305772 orang orang yang terdahulu lagi yang pertama tama masuk islam dari golongan muhajirin dan anshar dan orang orang yang mengikuti mereka dengan baik allah ridha kepada mereka dan merekapun ridha kepada allah dan allah menyediakan bagi mereka surga surga yang mengalir sungai sungai di dalamnya selama lamanya

1305775 qs an nisa 115 yang dimaksudkan dengan orang orang mukmin ketika ayat ini turun adalah para sahabat para salaf barangsiapa yang menyelisihi jalan mereka akan terancam kesesatan dan jahannam oleh karena itu mengikuti jalan salaf adalah wajib
1305776 penamaan salafi adalah bentuk penyandaran kepada salaf penyandaran seperti ini adalah penyandaran yang terpuji dan cara beragama bermanhaj yang tepat dan bukan penyandaran yang diada adakan sebagai madzhab baru
1305777 dan sesungguhnya orang yang hidup di antara kalian akan melihat perselisihan yang banyak maka berpegang teguhlah kalian terhadap sunnahku dan sunnah khulafarosyidin yang mendapat petunjuk maka berpegang teguh dengannya dan gigitlah dengan gigi geraham
1305778 yahudi telah terpecah menjadi 71 golongan satu golongan masuk surga 70 golongan masuk neraka nashrani terpecah menjadi 72 golongan satu golongan masuk surga 71 golongan masuk neraka demi dzat yang jiwa muhammad berada di tangan nya umatku akan terpecah menjadi 73 golongan satu golongan masuk surga dan 72 golongan masuk neraka ada sahabat yang bertanya wahai rasulullah siapa mereka yang masuk surga itu beliau menjawab mereka adalah
1305779 do you think thats enough to break our independence on middle eastern oil
1305780 all you need to do is inflate your tires thats all you need to do if every american would join in this effort of inflating ones tires then its all going to be fine and we can still import 70 percent of our oil from saudi arabia just keep those tires inflated
1305781 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1305782 with gas prices now hovering around 3 smart drivers care savvy consumers are seeking to increase fuel economy and the life of their tires by paying more attention to those rubber objects that are attached to their vehicle the time is now for drivers to focus on simple things like proper tire pressure to maximize tire performance and increase fuel economy
1305783 you can improve your gas mileage by around 3 3 percent by keeping your tires inflated to the proper pressure
1305784 every pound per square inch of tire underinflation wastes four million gallons of gas daily
1305785 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting from drilling
1305786 barang siapa yang dikehendaki baik oleh allah maka allah akan pahamkan dia dalam hal agamanya

1305788 barang siapa yang menuntut ilmu yang seharusnya hanya ditujukan untuk mencari wajah allah azza wa jalla tetapi dia justru berniat untuk meraih bagian kehidupan dunia maka dia tidak akan mencium bau surga pada hari kiamat
1305789 allah lah yang telah mengeluarkan kalian dari perut perut ibu kalian dalam keadaan tidak mengetahui sesuatu apapun dan kemudian allah ciptakan bagi kalian pendengaran penglihatan dan hati supaya kalian bersyukur
1305790 dan taatilah allah dan rasul nya dan janganlah kalian berselisih yang akan menceraiberaikan dan membuat kekuatan kalian melemah dan bersabarlah sesungguhnya allah bersama orang orang yang sabar
1305791 hikmah itu diberikan kepada siapa yang dikehendaki nya dan barang siapa yang diberi hikmah sungguh telah diberi kebaikan yang sangat banyak
1305792 dan barang siapa yang diberikan hikmah sungguh telah diberi kebaikan yang amat banyak
1305793 serulah ke jalan tuhanmu dengan hikmah dan nasehat yang baik dan debatlah mereka dengan cara yang lebih baik
1305794 dan janganlah kamu mendebat ahlu kitab kecuali dengan cara yang lebih baik kecuali kepada orang orang zhalim diantara mereka

1305825 of course the medals themselves have a much higher value than just the precious metals they are made of but it is interesting to note that silver has outperformed gold on price
1305826 its said that all that glitters is not gold and in this case it is certainly true with any investment whether it is a stock commodity or even a high street savings account just because it says gold it does not mean it will give you winning returns
1305827 the combination of falling employment confidence and rising inflation expectations is a lethal cocktail for consumer spending
1305828 with the cost of living increasing a significant number of us are being forced to use our savings to meet the rising costs you never know when youre going to need to fall back on your savings and in this respect dipping into them to meet bills such as gas bills is no bad thing
1305829 on the other hand dipping in to your isa savings could prove costly in the long term with a cash isa allowance of 3 600 per tax year any withdrawals made can not be replaced so that part of your allowance would be lost forever if youre saving towards a goal such as home deposit or looking to maximise the amount of cash you have put away for retirement then the advice must be to try and reduce your outgoings rather than dip into your isa pot
1305830 in recent months we have seen a significant increase in home improvement personal loan requests for the last decade homeowners have been able to sit back and rely on rising property prices to increase the equity in their home but sadly this is no longer possible if you want to trade up and avoid substantially increasing your mortgage youll need to add value to the house youre currently in
1305831 the current cooling of the property market is making homeowners think twice about selling up and many are opting to improve instead in a buoyant market people taking on a home improvement project could get away with less than perfect preparation or some slapdash sums as their mistakes were covered by rising property prices however in todays environment it is vital you plan any project thoroughly to ensure maximum return on investment
1305832 tackling fuel poverty is a priority for this government and i am pleased to welcome derek as the new chair for the fuel poverty advisory group i know he is as determined as i am to address this issue and do everything possible to help people struggling to pay their fuel bills
1305833 we are already supporting those most vulnerable to fuel poverty with warm front grants and winter fuel payments and have doubled the annual carbon savings through the carbon emissions reduction target a programme which will see energy suppliers investing 2 8 billion over three years in household energy efficiency to cut carbon footprints and energy bills
1305834 i am sure that dereks experience in the energy industry will provide valuable insight into how vulnerable people can take advantage of the different offers in the market further strengthen our work with the industry and ensure we help households across england to take up the help that is available to them
1305835 the challenge for the vulnerable consumer this winter to stay warm and well has never been greater record gas and electricity prices at present that are set to go even higher this winter demand immediate action to help those in society who are less able to help themselves i welcome this opportunity to work with the dedicated team of professionals that freely give their time to fpag and take on a challenge that is so urgent
1305836 this exclusive tracker mortgage will be an attractive option for any borrowers with some equity in their home and some funds set aside with which they can offset against the loan the headline rate is very competitive and we welcome scottish widows bank to our mortgage club for the first time
1305837 we are delighted to be joining the legal amp general mortgage club and are very pleased to introduce this attractive tracker mortgage exclusive to members the free offset facility allows clients greater flexibility to manage their finances and this is becoming a popular feature for many customers
1305838 the end of the housing market boom with house prices dropping ought to be good news for first time buyers who can finally be in a position to afford the home that was out of reach
1305839 however with the mortgage market contracting lenders are getting tougher on how much theyll lend and what level of deposit theyll demand which means first time buyers are yet to see much benefit from the house price slide
1305840 availability remains the major issue for the mortgage market but the focus for borrowers should still be on the true cost of their loan taking into account all fees as well as the monthly payments
1305841 the death of danieal kelly is one of the most tragic incidents that i have encountered in over 20 years of public service in philadelphia

1305845 we do expect to succeed with the 39 stores and be a dominant player in the market that were known in in the years to come

1305847 you do not see a whole lot of examples of retailers shrinking attractively
1305848 it just doesnt happen that often doesnt mean it cant happen
1305849 its been an emotional roller coaster for each one of us in our own way
1305850 ive got to say that the familys been extremely supportive every one of them
1305851 i think its important to all of us that we recognize that we are family
1305852 and at the end of the day maybe thats the most important thing
1305853 we will do everything possible to ensure the market is as vigorous as possible to ensure prices do go down mr bowen said
1305854 workably competitive but restricted by factors such as limited incentives for price competition between the major players coles and woolworths
1305855 we think economic factors and our customers shopping preferences should determine the location of our supermarkets not additional regulation that creates more red tape coles managing director ian mcleod said

1305858 ive had two good seasons but youve got to keep challenging yourself as a player to keep progressing and hopefully this season i can push on again
1305859 playing in europe is a big boost to everyone at villa but it also means you are playing against different systems and players which presents a challenge in itself
1305860 if i can play a bit in europe this season hopefully it will help me stay in the england squad and that i can win the first cap ashley young has had his first caps and i would love the same if i can impress the coach
1305861 this was going to be my last four piece competition but ive got to do whats best for the team
1305862 im fully fit for the bars and the floor which are my two strongest events my main aim is to help the team qualify for the team final
1305863 the worst part is over and i have had a lot of difficulties to overcome since the beginning but right now i am very happy with the progress i am making
1305864 that is thanks to the help i have had and i am just waiting for the moment when i am ready to play again
1305865 yes it can be difficult at times because i have never been through something like this before
1305866 i am still trying to get my focus back but the worst part is done with
1305867 that was the initial injury and the early rehabilitation i will try to come back as fast as i can and make sure i can play well when i do
1305868 i hope that i will know exactly how long it will take me to be back in training with my team mates
1305869 but all i heard was a horn and i turned around and she was on the ground
1305870 he was in the street with her and he just kept saying why wont you talk to me
1305871 you could hear her come screaming from a mile away
1305872 she would show up last year to every wrestling game to support her boyfriend even though he was out with an injury most of the season
1305873 youll be my first friend i met sic in heaven

1305881 it just seemed to me that whatever other personnel actions were going to be taken would have been taken at that time
1305882 the department of human services thats characterized in the grand jury report is from 2006
1305883 there is not a shadow of doubt in my mind that this department will turn around
1305884 despite the exceptional nature of danieals situation not one supervisor gave her case extra attention or offered any guidance to laura sommerer
1305885 those responsible for checking on her safety seemed to think she must be fine as long as she was alive even if she was sitting alone in a stroller in a dark room all day wasting away
1305886 the actions or inactions of these supervisors might arguably be considered criminal
1305887 the grand jury has decided however to focus its criminal charges on those individuals who were most directly involved in danieals neglect and death
1305888 a share of the stain of responsibility for danieals death remains on their hands
1305889 i think the owner of any major sports franchise has two jobs first its to work hard to win a championship year after year and second to be the caretaker of the franchise in the community
1305890 expensive and you may not have a shot at her
1305891 if theres a hooker you want it all comes down to price right and i think thats a better analogy
1305892 it is important for retailers like us to understand the real financial pressures that are facing uk families particularly when families do not have the choice to opt out like sending their children to school
1305893 kevin has got to play the way he wants to play look at his stats he is better than anyone in the side so why would you change let him go and do his thing
1305894 he is a fine player he has got confidence by the bucketload and he will probably take that into his captaincy the one thing we dont want is for him to change
1305895 for the 2006 ashes series in australia he worked so hard at dealing with the short ball he works so hard on his fitness as well quite a lot of thought goes into the way he plays
1305896 he averages 50 odd with the bat in both forms of the game and he is an unbelievable talent
1305897 everyone will ask will his batting be affected but knowing kevin he will probably average 70 as captain
1305898 portraying a victim of domestic violence has been the biggest challenge i have ever faced as an actress
1305899 just playing the role has taken a huge emotional toll on my life but it is nothing compared to the pain fear and torment experienced by the thousands of women refuge supports every day
1305900 its all too easy for women to excuse their partners possessive and jealous behaviour but in so doing they run the risk of the abuse increasing in frequency and severity over time

1305903 weve had indications from virginia that they would welcome the museum
1305904 but weve not entered into any discussions to do so because we believe valley forge is the preferred location
1305905 how long were going to stick around remains to be seen
1305906 we may well lose the support of the board and abandon it
1305907 its not a little museum thats going to close at 5 or 8 at night its a huge commercial development
1305908 once they pave this its gone forever its going to break my heart is what its going to do because this land should belong to all americans
1305909 it would have been very easy to give this up
1305910 it depends on the cloud we have over us from npca
1305911 have their own parochial reasons why they are opposed to it
1305912 they dont want a successful museum next to a park thats deteriorated bureaucracy and the government is often petty
1305913 our concern is the impact of this museum development on the historic character of valley forge
1305914 if we build the museum its going to be good for the park and the park would be good for arc
1305915 tragically illustrates how important our prompt and responsive involvement is to our citys children as i previously advised you continued failure to provide timely services or otherwise follow departmental policy or supervisory instruction will result in additional discipline up to and including termination of your employment
1305916 to fail to close and or transfer cases in a timely manner and this puts children at risk this failure to move your cases deprives children and families of the services that they desperately need
1305917 the dhs of 2008 is not the dhs of 2006
1305918 made excuses for the employees outrageous lapses and for her own failure to administer any consequences for failing to do their jobs
1305919 i read the grand jury report not just as the mayor of this city but also as the father of a daughter
1305920 it is appalling it is outrageous and i am heartbroken by what has happened here
1305921 i am fully thoroughly and completely pissed off about what has happened here when i think of my own daughter and if she were in someone elses care and city workers performed the way some of these individuals did i would kick their ass myself
1305922 the possibility that additional legal and or personnel actions may be taken
1305923 todays dhs is no longer the dhs of two years ago but the hard work to reform and improve must continue we take our responsibilities to the children very seriously
1305924 for the very few whoever they may be if this is not the kind of work that youre prepared to do then you should leave this city government right now
1305925 we dont need you and we dont want you in this government when we have the kind of behaviors that weve seen as a result of this grand jury report
1305926 poindexters slovenly neglectful and dangerously reckless work habits were not limited to danieals case
1305927 we got a call from animal control from a woman walking her dog who saw two roosters tied at the feet by ribbons hanging upside down
1305928 all the religious sacrifices ive seen theyve taken the head this is the first time i have seen the heads stuffed back into the birds
1305929 appeared to grow testy as he discussed his wifes failed bid for the nomination and was asked if he deserves at least some of the blame for his wifes losses
1305930 do you personally have any regrets about what you did campaigning for your wife
1305931 yes but not the ones you think and it would be counterproductive for me to talk about there are things that i wish id urged her to do things i wish id said things i wish i hadnt said
1305932 but i am not a racist ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked him personally
1305933 e difficile tutto dun tratto deporre un lungo amore difficile s ma devi farlo lo stesso la sola salvezza questa e devi farcela possibile o impossibile devi farcela

1305935 our focus is how do we get them here safely
1305936 it is our interest and desire to have elephants back at the philadelphia zoo in a financially responsible way and in a way thats right for the elephants
1305937 a lot of the behavior around having a baby and birthing a calf and taking care of a calf maternal care is learned beahvior we want them to learn from our elephants
1305938 if you are not prepared to take the action that needs to be taken if you cannot keep up and stay on top of things then you should leave this city government right now
1305939 the behavior exhibited by public employees is unacceptable i am furious at their actions
1305940 policies and procedures thats slightly abstract you had a real live person here who needed love and needed support and adults failed this person badly
1305941 this is serious work the fate of a child or a family could be in your hands
1305942 thats not to be taken lightly its not to be pushed over to the side its not to put papers in files some place and think the problem is going away
1305943 i had always felt that all things being equal probably the two biggest toughest hires were going to be police commissioner and dhs commissioner
1305944 it is so tragic it is so dehumanizing it is just astounding to me
1305945 ive just never read anything like that i hope to never read anything like that again
1305946 we are delighted to bring united house aboard they have a superb reputation for delivering major projects on time and with the minimum of disruption to tenants

1305969 the redevelopment of blackfriars underground station is part of network rail works
1305970 once the works are complete customers will get a new upgraded station with step free access increased capacity and better interchange facilities between the tube and national rail services
1305971 during this time district and circle line services will not stop at the station and customers are advised to use nearby temple and mansion house stations
1305972 illegal houses of multiple occupation present a clear danger to those living in them and a nuisance to those living nearby in this case neighbours who were disturbed by smells
1305973 landlords who decide to profit from cramming people into properties should take note that we will take enforcement action to stop this kind of exploitation
1305974 you have pleaded guilty to a large number of very serious offences particularly taking into account the 68 offences which you have placed before us
1305975 the nature of this abuse to the victims was particularly offensive
1305976 both the harassment and the criminal damage offences were targeted very often to homes of the individuals involved and were vindictive in nature
1305977 by your own admission this course of action was intimidatory
1305978 we cannot ignore the stated intent to interfere with the democratic process
1305979 we do have to say that we regard the charges and the offences against you as to be very very serious indeed so serious that custody would be an option

1305992 the technology and latency of old fashioned cable systems will have to be overcome for this network dvr to be successful but fios has already been offering advanced dvrs for some time now
1305993 however as the forum found there are still dark corners of the labour market where rogue employers seek to mistreat their workers and more needs to be done to safeguard peoples rights
1305994 it is vital we boost awareness of employment rights and ensure those rights are properly enforced there should be no hiding place for employers who exploit vulnerable workers and who are not prepared to obey the law this is in the interests of workers themselves and as was made clear by business representatives on the forum it is in the interests of the reputable businesses who treat their workers fairly and obey the law
1305995 an opportunity has been missed to address the legal and regulatory flaws which keep two million workers in conditions which shame a modern economy
1305996 with new eu moves on agency working and working time and changes on migrant domestic worker visas these are worthwhile changes won by union campaigning that will make a real difference to many vulnerable workers whose employers are breaking employment law
1305997 disneys price increases actually appear to be more modest than 2007

1306001 we are anxious to hear from anyone who saw the collision or the circumstances leading up to it
1306002 to be quite honest and practical i dont think theyll ever find who done it
1306003 anyone who knows me knows it is not in my make up at all no one but no one should do that to a human being
1306004 i cannot begin to understand what they might be going through i can only say that i am not the perpetrator i am not the killer i just hope they get justice
1306005 lets look at the question that is being asked is there dna from madeleine on the swab it would be very simple to say yes simply because of the number of components within the result that are also in her reference sample what we need to consider as scientists is whether the match is genuine because madeleine has deposited dna as a result of being in the car or whether madeleine merely appears to match the result by chance
1306006 we cannot answer the question is the match genuine or is it a chance match
1306007 i still dont know whether i will continue at real madrid its not defined yet the season is just starting and ive been given some offers from other clubs i have one from chelsea but nothing has been sorted out yet we are just discussing
1306008 after i looked again at the programmes of real madrid and oranje i came to the conclusion that i had to make a choice because of the necessary physical effort to achieve the maximum at this level
1306009 the whole family were around everyone was shouting when we got to the area his friends had uncovered his head then we concentrated on uncovering his torso we felt the problem was the weight of sand on his body and all our efforts went into getting the sand away from his chest area
1306010 the family were shouting at him to help himself believing that he was conscious and able to help us

1306017 today almost 60 percent of the u s population drinks fluoridated water including residents of 46 of the nations 50 largest cities
1306018 concluded that fluoride can subtly alter endocrine function especially in the thyroid the gland that produces hormones regulating growth and metabolism
1306019 a series of epidemiological studies in china have associated high fluoride exposures with lower iq
1306020 epidemiological studies and tests on lab animals suggest that high fluoride exposure increases the risk of bone fracture especially in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and diabetics
1306021 iowa children who lived in communities where the water was fluoridated were 50 percent more likely to have mild fluorosis than nine year old children living in nonfluoridated areas of the state
1306022 new american research suggests that boys exposed to fluoride between the ages of five and 10 will suffer an increased rate of osteosarcoma bone cancer between the ages of 10 and 19

1306083 were not dictating individual behavior what were trying to do is make the world a place where its easier to be healthy
1306084 theyre not the surgeon general or the centers for disease control
1306085 im just happy that timo had a really strong race here
1306086 jarno would have had a stronger race if he hadnt been caught behind mark webber because of a bad start overall im very happy
1306087 i really cant find the words to celebrate this result
1306088 the best of our season we had a few difficulties in practice but during qualifying the drivers pushed themselves to the limit and things got
1306089 it shows that if the car is right i can show my potential
1306090 no one should think that we will now be on the podium all the time
1306091 our problem has been consistency but i hope we can start to turn that around starting now
1306092 the competition in the nascar craftsman truck series is so tight and to be able to put together race wins is quite an accomplishment
1306093 trip bruce crew chief has done a great job all year giving me good enough trucks to win we have had great pit stops which has really helped us get to the front
1306094 it is a great place to race and has one of the most coveted trophies in nascar
1306095 i would love nothing more than to bring our toyota certified used vehicles toyota to victory lane on saturday night i need another gibson to add to my trophy case
1306096 we know what we have to do to be able to get more wins and hopefully the championship
1306097 we have to finish in the top five week in and week out to be able to compete for the championship ron hornaday and matt crafton are both really having a great year and we have to be on our a game in order to keep our chances alive
1306098 im excited i got my start racing off road trucks so its going to be cool to be back in a truck
1306099 ive never driven in the series before ive always wondered how they drive and what theyre about
1306100 ive spent so much time with ron hornaday and hes been such a big part of my career to be able to go out and race against him is going to be a blast
1306101 billy ballew motorsports has great equipment and great people i love racing at nashville and have had some of my best races there so all of the elements are there for us to have a good day
1306102 one of the coolest things about nashville is the trophy
1306103 its one of those trophies that every driver wants to have up in their display case i am hoping this race will give me a reason to brush up on my guitar skills
1306104 its a great track and its a lot of fun for a driver
1306105 the argument came from when it started raining real hard then we were trying to blame one another for the idea of coming onto pit road
1306106 bob said it was my idea and i really felt like it was his idea i had to leave the pit box because i was worried bob was going to like punch me in the neck or something
1306107 i had to walk away but personally i feel like we have a good relationship we can be perfectly honest with one another and thats really valuable
1306108 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there but bob osborne is just real smart im really proud of him for the strategy bob did a really good job but i wasnt so sure when we were yelling at each other about halfway through
1306109 i think we were both about 51 percent for coming to the pits but after it started raining harder we started blaming each other for making the call
1306110 going into the chase youre going to see a lot of heated moments
1306111 the nikon indy 300 will see four days of the worlds best motorsport entertainment on the streets of surfers paradise
1306112 nikon is globally recognised for setting new standards in product design and performance a perfect fit for our world class event
1306113 we know the stars of the indycar series and the v8 supercars are really looking forward to this event from october 23 26 as a major highlight on the annual motorsport calendar
1306114 with the naming rights sponsor now announced we are powering full steam ahead towards this years event which is now less than three months away
1306115 nikon has a one year deal with an option for a further two years
1306116 motor sport is always a major occasion for photography and the nikon indy 300 will be a sensational spectacle guaranteed to offer many magical moments
1306117 the indycar series is synonymous with precision machinery and so too is nikon where 90 years of research development and design ensures all nikon cameras perform at levels that can stop an indycar in its tracks
1306118 it is with great pleasure that we welcome nikon to 96 hours of non stop excitement over october 23 26 when the gold coast comes alive to the sound of the indycars and australias own v8 supercars burning up the track
1306119 with the non stop action of the indycar series and the v8 supercars against the backdrop of one of the most famous beach side cities in the world the event is a photographers dream and one which i am sure will provide nikon with many great memories
1306120 tarah is an all around beautiful girl whos been competing in and winning motocross competitions all over the world for years now
1306121 i follow her career like a hawk and am so proud of all her accomplishments
1306122 it is just so tight with good drivers in both teams ferrari and mclaren
1306123 right now they are all in with a shout which is very good for the sport because you dont want it to become predictable and you dont want number one drivers in a team
1306124 id be saying wait a moment that ferrari looks strong so as an outside bet id put my money on raikkonen
1306125 im sure lewis wasnt happy about being pipped at the start in hungary and i think there was a point when he thought hang on this is now looking a little bit worrying because on qualifying pace he should have been able to hound the ferrari but he couldnt get close
1306126 you start to get worried when things are not going according to plan and then of course he got the puncture
1306127 he said before the race im not counting any chickens and getting ahead of myself but im absolutely certain he
1306128 im pleased with my driving but i came here to win and loeb found a few seconds more
1306129 it was a fantastic rally and an amazing fight and its unfortunate i didnt win in front of my home fans i pushed right to the end but it wasnt enough im pleased to still lead the championship but one point isnt much the speed was crazy sometimes we could have thrown our pace notes away and just gone for it and ive learned that i could have made my notes quicker
1306130 the rally didnt go as i expected unfortunately and i didnt achieve what i wanted which was a podium i feel quite empty it ended for me on friday morning and that was all due to an error i made on the recce when i didnt mark a rock in my pace notes at least i got my confidence rhythm and speed back and drove the new stages which is good for the future it was difficult to be motivated but the best medicine after an accident is to get back behind the wheel i know the speed is there so i hope that next year ill have the chance to fight for a win here
1306131 this was an excellent result especially as i havent competed for over two months it was difficult to find the required balance of attacking hard enough and being cautious over the huge crests one error on the big jumps is enough to drain a drivers confidence and this is the ultimate confidence event im looking forward to the next rally in germany which is a very different kind of rally
1306132 this wasnt the result we were looking for but having lost jari matti so early it made it more difficult for mikko because he had to think about both championships he delivered an incredible performance and learned a lot having to battle with loeb for three days which will make him stronger they were 0 5sec km quicker than the rest of the field and i think mikko drove better than last year which is a big achievement
1306133 tens of thousands of spectators packed the forests to see the action while the service park in the centre of jyv skyl provided great entertainment in itself for entire families and generated the kind of atmosphere for which finland is renowned once again this rally has shown it is the championships benchmark that every event must aspire to match

1306141 hes the type of player we need hell get stuck in and do the dirty things
1306142 hell be a good example and show what we want the likes of josh coulson and gavin hoyte to be doing
1306143 weve worked on a lot of different things this year so were just trying to figure out what the best plan is we had a problem there at beaver dam so were putting a new car together for this week you just never know with a new car sometimes theyre fast out of the box and sometimes it takes a night or two to figure them out hopefully this one is fast right out of the box i know all the tsr guys are working hard so that we have a fast bass pro shop car on thursday its a big race and i wish that we had a little more momentum going our way right now the good thing is one night can change everything were hoping for the best
1306144 it starts with the luck of the pill draw if you can get a good number and then go out and lay down a good lap your chances for success are better were just thinking about hot laps right now you get four or five laps to feel your car out and honestly those are some of the most important laps of the year after that you get the car better and go out and try to make the smoothest laps you can and go from there
1306145 its a lot of fun to be at this race and knowing that weve won it before i know it takes a lot of things going your way to have it all come together were looking forward to getting out there thursday night and see what we can do
1306146 im real happy with the mobil 1 dodge and all the guys that work on it
1306147 the car was good and we had a top 15 car if not better than that im real happy with the progress that weve made since we were here last time it seems like things are kind of starting to come together for us we need to keep this consistency up of having top 15 cars and then were going to start finishing there a lot more often
1306148 its hard to believe that we had a potential top five car after the red flag period and even led the race with 40 laps to go we tried our best and its just another example of how hard this season has been
1306149 ma il nostro era pi grosso pi alto era enorme e poi era in mezzo al nulla

1306153 mah io soprattutto venivo per mangiare le more e poi arrampicarmi sui rami mi faceva sentire molto tarzan
1306154 giovanna ma tu lo avevi capito che ero innamorato di te
1306155 il giorno che dovevo partire venni a salutarti arrivai vicino al fiume e ti vidi giocare e scherzare con giulio ero a pochi metri da voi quando tu lo hai abbracciato quasi di scatto e gli hai dato un lungo bacio sulla guancia con gli occhi chiusi lo ricordo bene sentii un pugno qui alla bocca dello stomaco una vampata di calore in viso e scappai via
1306156 mi ha fatto piacere rivederti ma ora devo scappare giurami che ripassi magari mangiamo un boccone assieme e ci facciamo un bagno ok
1306157 we need to rebuild position in cuba and other countries
1306158 we dont see dealing with the cuban government as particularly productive
1306159 it is not a secret that the west is creating a buffer zone around russia involving in the process countries in central europe the caucasus the baltic states and ukraine
1306160 in response we may expand our military presence abroad including in cuba
1306161 the weather circumstances were not very good today but we had to deal with it and we did in the first part of the race both riders were doing well it is really a pity that didier had a broken battery because he was on the right way barry showed again that we can ride in the front he was riding strong and we will continue this during the next race
1306162 actually i expected a little more today a top five position was my goal in the first part of the race i felt stronger and stronger it started to rain but that didnt bother me i had the feeling that i could make the gap between me and the front group up after the red flag situation i had a better start then the first time but it was harder for me to find that strong feeling back this feeling could have come back during the race but there was no time anymore to realise that the big crash of jones is a very sad end of this race
1306163 i trained a lot to make a good start and that worked out well during the race i was able to follow a group which was battling for the points and after two laps i made some actions and passed some riders on the seventh lap i noticed that my machine lost power and unfortunately there was nothing else to do than turning back to the pits it is really a shame because i had a good feeling during the race but again i made a step forward and i showed that i can fight for the points
1306164 it was a good race for us today we got a decent start on the rockstar makita suzuki gsx r1000 and the guys got out there i didnt want to let them get in a rhythm so i pushed past as quick as i could and wanted to set my pace we made a couple changes this morning and i realised i had a bike that was capable of going a little bit quicker than yesterday so i wanted to get out there and get the most out of it while i could i opened up a gap and was able to hold on at the end
1306165 we got a way better start than yesterday and i got into the lead and tried to go as quick as i could then mat came by and i got in behind him and i was riding as hard as i could but then i settled into a pace that was good for me the rockstar makita suzuki gsx r1000 was working a little better today than yesterday but we just didnt have the quick laps in the middle of the race overall the bike was working a little bit better and i was feeling a little bit better too
1306166 things were a little bit better today than yesterday we at least got to go the full distance my crew made some changes overnight to the rockstar makita suzuki gsx r1000 and it was faster today it was quite a bit faster today im happy with today because we improved all weekend long we were a little bit behind because we missed the test at this track while i was injured but we made small improvements all weekend now im looking forward to the test at road atlanta next week and getting back to normal
1306167 there is nothing intrinsically unfair or unusual about setting new ved rates for cars that have already purchased
1306168 were delighted that the mps believe that the governments car tax changes are right in principle and that they have urged the treasury to consider our suggestion of a car scrappage scheme
1306169 three times more second hand cars are bought each year than new ones so upping ved on old polluting vehicles will encourage people to choose greener models cut fuel bills and lower carbon dioxide emissions
1306170 ministers must stand firm on their ved plans and do more to encourage greener travel and reduce transports contribution to climate change such as backing tough fuel efficiency standards for new cars and investing in alternatives such as rural public transport and faster cheaper rail

1306177 i took a good start in moto one and i was riding well until i crashed
1306178 after that it was difficult to get my speed and rhythm back especially with the track being so rough i was happy to finish the race fourth because i know that i could have done better but yeah it was still good to take the series lead
1306179 i knew race two was going to be tough because of how rough the circuit looked on the sighting lap i got another good start and took the holeshot this time i didnt hold on to the lead for long though because nagl and barragan were very fast in the beginning my riding was going okay and i tried to follow the leaders but i crashed i got going again and i could see philippaerts in front of me and i knew it was important for me to get by him
1306180 luckily for me he crashed but then two corners later i hit neutral going into a corner and stalled the motor it took a long time to start the engine again because my legs were tired but i managed to get going ahead of philippaerts and pulled away before the finish to end up fifth in the race and fifth overall
1306181 the track wasnt really how i expected it to be today and i didnt like it so much really
1306182 i didnt get such a good start in moto one and i had to use a lot of energy coming through the pack in the early laps but it was good to lead the race then i made one or two mistakes because i wasnt concentrating so much and they were able to come back by me but to finish third was not too bad
1306183 in the second moto i got another not so great start and then in the fourth or fifth corner i crashed but i was up and away quite soon it was a hard race and so i just took my own rhythm to ensure that i could keep going until the end of the race
1306184 my intention coming into this race was to take points from the leading riders in the championship and ive done that so im quite happy
1306185 this is the first time weve raced a grand prix in this type of conditions for a good few years so after extensively testing fuel consumption with ken de dycker because he is the largest consumer of fuel in the team for this race we have fitted a fuel tank with one litre more capacity
1306186 the heavy conditions also put extra strain on the engine and this can raise the temperature significantly so to combat this the bikes are fitted with larger radiators the riders might lose a little bit in comfort but its important to us to cross the finish line aside from that the only real change is to the final drive ratio which is shorter than normal due to the heavy conditions
1306187 its going to be a busy week thats for sure
1306188 ive worked with jimmy in the past and shared four wins together im really looking forward to his input into our racing programs and the constructive progress lucas oil racing should make
1306189 the front three were really going at it hard early and i just decided to sit back for a few scott steckly has surely set a modern day record in top tier canadian racing with his sixth podium finish in seven events in 2008 stecklys tow truck in a box schick erb group dodge avenger finished in second in saturdays running of the napa 100 at circuit gilles villeneuve in montreal laps and wait for my chance it finally came and we were in the right position to move up our tow truck in a box schick team did everything right again today and while a win would have been nice big picture is it helped us extend our points lead
1306190 race 3s result was a real credit to this supercheap auto racing team they did a great job under pressure considering the left front got torn off completely they had about half an hour to fix it get the wheels back on and aligned and prepped for the race it was an awesome job to then have the fastest car in the race was a pretty big achievement that race was for them
1306191 today we really struggled with the front end and had way to much understeer it was just pushing too hard
1306192 i kept watching the board to see who was behind me and if anyone was close
1306193 there didnt seem to be anybody right on me so i just kept trying to run my race
1306194 that hole in turn two about ate me up a couple of times
1306195 i got where i was just trying to ride through it and that actually made it a little worse i think we survived it though
1306196 it means the world to me to win this race
1306197 f sicamente es imposible que sigan vivos a m s de 8 000 metros

1306207 why hitlers driver was not prosecuted as a war criminal
1306208 murder in violation of the law of war is not the same as killing any lawful combatant
1306209 this is an improved process weve been working to put in place to help families during a time of great grief and were glad to be able to implement this positive change
1306210 so that we dont have the confusion that weve had in the past
1306211 i dont think a parent should have to be stressing for money when their main focus is losing their child to a war
1306212 i was stunned i was in shock just two days prior finding out my son was killed and now this
1306213 i think thats wonderful because a family shouldnt have to be told to wait several weeks
1306214 i dont want any other parents to go through the hassle that we went through when all i shouldve been focused on was my son
1306215 non c ee nieeen teee che siaaaa per seeem preeee troooppo ormai che staiii cosi male il tuo diploma un fallimento una laurea per reagiiireeee

1306223 i came back the next day and gave the hot dogs to the old folks and lifted the little girl up
1306224 in my jacket was an orange they were not available in the war my wife sent me one dipped in paraffin wax to preserve it i thought id take this to the little girl she felt it in my jacket and asked what is this i told her it was an orange she took it of course i had chocolates for her too
1306225 i asked if the opera house was still there across from the railroad station
1306226 she said yes and said i remember how an american soldier gave me my first orange chills went down my spine
1306227 she said the american soldiers were really friendly and that they helped people when the war was over
1306228 then the story of the orange came up about how one of the soldiers came and gave her the first orange of her life
1306229 i want a j and anthony to know each other
1306230 i believe you will have the opportunity to do that
1306231 it was very emotional its hard to see him in uniform its the first time ive seen him in cammies since his deployment
1306232 the amount of support from the military has been unbelievable
1306233 were not sure how far hes going to go its unknown if he will make a full recovery
1306234 before the game i thought weve got the players we can win it
1306235 but when it was a red card not a yellow i thought it was going to be a big ask
1306236 even when we went 1 0 up i still thought it was going to be a big ask because i always thought the dutch were the best side in the competition
1306237 having watched them previously i know they score goals we needed to score more than they did and after the red card we didnt quite have enough to go and get them
1306238 with it coming after only 20 minutes it was inevitable theyd score eventually had we kept all 11 on the pitch you never know but thats the way football goes
1306239 the red card spoilt it for me because wed had the lions share of the game and they changed the way they were playing for us theyd never played with a back five before
1306240 the players have done terrifically being away from home for two weeks
1306241 i was told that could cause problems but to be fair there was probably less than any of the pro sides ive taken away
1306242 i think the way forward now is to develop the younger players like royce greenidge who have done brilliantly
1306243 im delighted that the whole game is working together on this issue
1306244 this has been a personal priority and i would like to thank our various partner organisations for their support
1306245 changing a culture is about long term commitment to change negative attitudes and abusive behaviour it needs the whole game working together to make a real difference and that is what collectively we have done
1306246 football engages motivates and inspires but at times we know it can spill over and get ugly we all have a responsibility to deal with these excesses and i sense there is a commitment from all quarters of the game including the media to deal with it
1306247 the premier league our clubs the players and the referees are all engaged we want to make sure that this ends up being much more than a campaign and results in making unacceptable behaviour just that unacceptable
1306248 it is vitally important that the professional game plays its part towards ensuring the success of this initiative
1306249 our matches contribute towards setting the tone for the whole domestic game with the behaviour of players and managers being re enacted on football pitches across the country every weekend this message was relayed recently to all football league club managers at their pre season meetings
1306250 rarely before has there been such determination and solidarity across the game on these important issues it is therefore vital that we take this opportunity to make a lasting difference

1306289 the hungarian gp turned out to be a race we virtually werent involved in
1306290 at no point in time were our drivers able to clock the lap times we had expected following our performance on friday and saturday and this applied to both tyre compounds
1306291 we have not yet detected the reasons but we will analyse what happened to do so we will take a close look at the interplay of car tyres track conditions and temperatures
1306292 this analysis will be carried out at home in munich and hinwil as we arent allowed to go testing due to the testing ban prior to the next race
1306293 following the short summer break formula one will make its debut appearance on valencias new street circuit that runs around the harbour
1306294 the truth is the result at budapest represented a real disappointment nonetheless we wont reduce our development pace for the remainder of the season
1306295 im happy for galveston that we dodged another bullet but i feel sorry for those people east of us where the storm is going to hit

1306298 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1306299 cheney has not sought a speaking slot at the convention nor has his staff sought a role for him at the convention the mccain campaign has not gone out of its way to reach out to cheney though a segment of conservative republicans had been pressing the campaign to include cheney in the convention agenda

1306302 the air france results really look good and the outlook has been confirmed beyond the results the fall in the price of oil is supporting the whole sector
1306303 i think so long as oil doesnt pop higher the dollar will remain supported
1306304 admittedly oil has dropped by over 17 from its peak suggesting that the fed should be less concerned about its impact on inflation expectations
1306305 however note that the fed cut rates to 2 as insurance against a severe credit crisis the fed is likely to question if rates need to be kept so low as credit conditions stabilize
1306306 these figures will do nothing to quell fears that the economy is sliding towards negative growth and the prospect of a technical recession looks increasingly likely

1306310 were a public service group and we dont know of anyone who would have an axe to grind against us were at a loss we have no enemy
1306311 the number of doctors who leave the country is increasing more than ever while there is visa retrogression in the united states they still hire foreign doctors and nurses they just dont give migrant visas but merely contractual visas and with the opening of these three more countries we can expect the exodus to continue
1306312 for the past 25 years canada was only hiring caregivers now canada is a new market for our doctors and nurses
1306313 the city has some of the worst congestion in china we were worried there would be traffic difficulties and also that the crowds would be too large
1306314 hopes are high that we will be able to get the two thirds vote that would be around 15 or 16
1306315 i witheld my concurrence meaning i did not concur with the treaty because the two countries could not agree on the side agreement which was intended to resolve or cure the disdagreements between two countries
1306316 it jpepa is edging towards ratification and i hope that will convince them senators tomorrow because we will lose a lot in terms of economic benefits if we do not concur
1306317 since the constitutional proivisions of which i am very adamant for the past year have already been accepted by japan i have no more problems with it as a constitutional law scholar
1306318 in any event there would be no more debate on constitutionality because the japanese foreign minister has authorized the japanese ambasador here to enter into an exchange of notes presumably with foreign affairs secretary alberto romulo
1306319 the senate is supposed to concur if it believes that the needs of filipinos have been aptly protected i dont believe they were aptly protected i believe that the terms could have been improved based on similar terms granted to neighboring countries therefore i am not ready to support jpepa
1306320 well have tests just so we can rule out everything it kind of grabbed and it was a little bit tighter in the fifth inning
1306321 well see what the tests reveal i dont think its serious i dont think hell be shut down a long time

1306327 users want saas throughout the enterprise whether their enterprises are ready for it or not
1306328 saas is spreading throughout the enterprise whether the vendors or their offerings are ready to support and deliver what users want
1306329 providers are therefore expanding and improving saas offerings to meet and exceed user desire and demand as well as to establish and extend their competitive advantages
1306330 the vendors most challenged by saas will be the thousands of smaller independent software vendors that see opportunity in saas but are uncertain of what needs to be done to take advantage of it
1306331 the arrangement was not dissimilar to the agreement struck between the us military and sunni muslim insurgents in central iraq

1306342 what ceo is going to say no to profit optimization
1306343 internet travel sites dragged hotels online kicking and screaming and they didnt have the technology to deal with a new environment
1306344 we made an early call that internet bookings would dominate the market so we turned the technology inside out by going from client server to an annual saas subscription and we focused on making the service very easy to use
1306345 most hotels in the u s are independently owned and operated franchises
1306346 the hotel chains can provide franchisees with a certain amount of expertise but then theres another layer of opportunity at the property level ideas saas model has a scalability that can work with single property on up to hotel chains with hundreds or thousands of properties
1306347 media is one area where we think theres a good fit
1306348 a lot of the advertising networks and cable companies have come to us and said help us use this to figure out what we should charge for advertising any industry in which you have demand at different price points and particularly more demand than you have supply or a product that might perish you can use different models to forecast the demand at different price points

1306360 while every picture is automatically an image of the past this commission was about photographing the future the idea was to showcase the future view from the penthouse of a condominium that would be built in sunny

1306362 all of the light colored pixels appear from the majority of the
1306363 the access i was granted is available to any visitor to this museum perhaps it is unique in that everyone is encouraged to take the guided tour up the steel ladder into the aircraft one and all is given the privilege of a hands on look inside this and other aircraft in fact i had to compete for space with a stream of patient visitors midland air museum is an interactive museum expertly run by dedicated enthusiasts not to be missed
1306364 in this day and age loyalties are lacking in sport and often money talks too loudly
1306365 i think when it comes to issues like that there are certain traditions that need to be followed in sport and the ioc should have ensured this didnt happen
1306366 there is a younger generation who dont want to dope there has been a shift and a change of culture
1306367 one difference is that the riders are starting to self police and it is becoming unacceptable they are starting to point the finger at people that is quite a change from decades ago when doping was almost the norm
1306368 without a doubt there has been an impact the more tests there are the better we encourage that and anything we that can do to keep that going through these games and carrying on from there we will support it
1306369 our sport has its issues and we cant get away from that so the more tests we can do for cyclists and the more people who are caught the better
1306370 we know across the board exactly where we are at and we know where the opposition is and what sort of times we are looking to ride rather than work on medals which are kind of out of our control we work on specific times if we achieve those that is our success and if we achieve those times i am fairly confident we can move on from where we were in athens
1306371 i suspect it was their choice you would have to talk to them as to what prompted them to do this
1306372 i will say this i am not a scientist but in my view that was unnecessary
1306373 i dont believe there was any statement trying to be made
1306374 i am confident that the air quality will not pose major problems to athletes and visitors here
1306375 we will evaluate those and should problems arise we may take some action
1306376 the misty air is not a feature of pollution but a feature of evaporation and humidity
1306377 i suspect it was their choice you would have to talk to them as to what prompted them to do this i will say this i am not a scientist but in my view that was unnecessary
1306378 i thought i was 80 percent sure i would be doubling now im 100 percent
1306379 but the 200 is closer to my heart and the 100 is a factor of me not wanting to do the 400 metres really
1306380 the training for the 400 is too hard im not lazy though i used to be
1306381 we are not going to annul the executive board decision before the games the rule stands
1306382 i would not want to see anyone who cheated in doping in any games but i think we could be in trouble
1306383 one of the reasons we think that we can stand up to any challenges is that it is not a question of a sanction
1306384 i feel im empowered im a sportswoman im getting stronger all the time and this is my uniform
1306385 i dont feel exploited at all hopefully were just encouraging people to be fit and healthy our lifestyle is so wonderful
1306386 i dont really care about the image you just get out and play and feed off the support
1306387 if we hadnt had that kind of experience we wouldnt be involved in this project
1306388 we definitely had to have credentials they were insistent on that
1306389 the olympic stadium site is now a hive of activity and over the coming months we will see the stadium structure start to rise from the ground
1306390 we are not complacent about the challenges that lie ahead but we have made a strong start
1306391 real progress is being made every day on the site
1306392 the last time we got our quota places qualification just a few months before the games but this time around everybody got it at least two years in advance
1306393 weve been together many times and ive not seen anyone mentally tougher
1306394 from a scientific perspective green carbon accounting and protection of the natural forests in all nations should become part of a comprehensive approach to solving the
1306395 protecting the carbon in australias and the worlds natural forests is no longer an option it is a necessity
1306396 if natural forests continue to be cleared and degraded then the carbon dioxide released will significantly increase concentrations of
1306397 actually people have this belief that all women trading in kasuwan mata are divorcees this is not true because many of us are married women and our husbands know that were into this business this is as a result of the economic state of our country it used to be quite unusual for a muslim woman especially hausa to come out and sell things in an open market but that was an era ago as northern women now trade to cater for their families because the burden is usually too much on our husbands
1306398 80 per cent of my suppliers of these second hand items are women desperately in need of money
1306399 new wrappers or used ones we buy from them and resell to those in need of them
1306400 we amend those that need amendment and resell to people in need
1306401 we dont sell these items in a shop because this market is temporary we are yet to be allocated shops as soon as were allocated shops the market will be re organised
1306402 as you can see my stand is directly in front of a house it is the landlord malam bala that permitted many of us to sell our wares even though we dont pay him any rent
1306403 actually i sell both new and used items here but i usually go to kano to buy my new wares for sale
1306404 on the other hand people from different places come to me to sell their used items ranging from wrappers furniture kitchen utensils among others in fact theres nothing that i dont sell so far its useable but most of my wares are brand new i travel every month end to kano to buy my new wares
1306405 sometimes people that are tired of using some of their items bring them to me to help them sell others sell their items when transferred to other places this saves them the trouble of hiring lorries to convey their wares to their new areas of posting
1306406 in fact many police officers come to me when they are transferred out of kaduna as a women leader i help them to sell their items like furniture mattresses etc
1306407 most of us trading here have plans to move to the new market called kasuwan karshen kwalta but the problem is up till now were yet to be allocated shops in the market we have applied and were awaiting governments response
1306408 some are widows that have all the responsibilities placed on them while others are married women like me
1306409 some people even call us divorcees which is far from the truth as many of us are married and im not disputing the fact that we have divorcees in our midst but they are few contrary to rumour that all the traders in this market are divorcees
1306410 most of our customers come here looking for fairly used items only few come to purchase brand new ones due to cheapness of the second hand items
1306411 ora va tutto bene grazie ho avuto un po di problemi piuttosto gravi diciamo certo lo stress sul lavoro non mi ha aiutato per sono pronto a ricominciare fra un paio di settimane rientro
1306412 guarda che io ho bisogno della tua massima disponibilit lo capisci mi serviresti da ieri per la verit ti voglio al centoventipercento perch non rientri subito
1306413 sto finendo una terapia questione di pochi giorni lo sa io non mi sono mai tirato indietro ho sempre viaggiato a ritmi forsennati la voglia di lavorare c certo correre quattordici ore al giorno sempre in giro per litalia non so se riuscir a riprendere fin da subito lo stesso passo
1306414 questo un po mi preoccupa comunque la filiale grande una soluzione la troveremo lasciami parlare con calzavacca ci sono settori dove forse avresti meno pressioni limportante che ora tu stia meglio e che torni fra noi lo dico per te
1306415 si ho sentito marzioni sono contento senti ferdinando tu capisci che dopo sei mesi non possiamo lasciarti nel tuo ruolo non va bene lazienda deve dare dei segnali precisi sei stato via tanto
1306416 eeeh lo so lo so ma nel tuo ruolo uno viene a lavorare pure con la febbre o con il polso rotto sai come funziona
1306417 mmhm io non potevo davvero fare diversamente e comunque sono pronto a riprendere il mio posto certo non voglio nemmeno creare problemi alla societ sono disponibile anche a valutare altre opportunit non voglio litigare
1306418 ma magari visto i problemi che hai avuto forse una situazione con meno pressioni potrebbe esserti pi congeniale lasciami un mese o due per valutare un po di cose e ne riparliamo intanto potresti prendere delle ferie arretrate
1306419 no grazie non ne ho bisogno preferisco rientrare fra una settimana come avevo gi comunicato tanto di cose da fare ce n a iosa
1306420 ah eccoti bentornato ho dato disposizioni di coinvolgerti subito su un paio di progetti a cui tengo molto per adesso il tuo team va avanti in autonomia tu non te ne occupi ho anche parlato con il direttore del personale e gli ho detto
1306421 io io veramente vorrei rimanere a milano credo sia anche un mio diritto qui ho la famiglia i miei parenti gli amici abbiamo un bimbo piccolo almeno per i prossimi due anni non me la sento di affrontare un trasferimento e n posso fare avanti e indietro
1306422 beh questo rende le cose un po pi complesse vedi a roma o palermo avrei decine di soluzioni mentre qui non ne ho nessuna al momento
1306423 io lho gi detto non voglio litigare ma se mi trasferite mi create un grosso problema
1306424 non ti preoccupare vedrai che si risolve tutto ci aggiorniamo ok
1306425 armando vedi che sta per tornare quello stronzo di peretti ci ho parlato qualche giorno fa
1306426 gi guarda non pu assolutamente passare il concetto che uno sta via dei mesi torna e ritrova la sua scrivania mica a casa sua che fa come cazzo gli pare sei daccordo
1306427 sfondi una porta aperta ma stiamo scherzando tra laltro creerebbe un precedente pericoloso
1306428 a me uno cos non serve toglimelo dalle palle fallo f u o r i io ho gi messo uno di mia fiducia al suo posto ufficialmente con un ruolo diverso chiaro e sta andando benissimo
1306429 just a heads up about a crazy project we are soon to do we at xrez are

1306431 i think the iphone is a potentially extremely important platform for a lot of reasons and i think it could be the type of thing that really makes inroads into
1306432 our formula of flowers music and entertainment remains the traditional basis of the show but we are constantly introducing improvements with an eye on the needs of young visitors hence our policy of letting accompanied children aged 16 and under in free and developing the childrens area
1306433 the travellers have still officially got until seven tonight to vacate the site but the earliest we can physically remove them is thursday morning
1306434 we need police on standby if we move them on and thursday morning is the soonest we could guarantee that
1306435 however my gut feeling is that the travellers will move on tonight
1306436 when you attack the land where hindus primarily live on the basis that primarily hindus live there by extension you attack hinduism
1306437 however hindus organizing under the banner of their religion for the defense of their religion and their ancestral land is not anti indian behavior on the contrary its one of the sources of our firm national will to defend our republic

1306449 the fireman was fantastic he knew exactly how to turn her foot to get it out of the chair he used washing up liquid to make it a bit slippery
1306450 we are just grateful they got her foot out and they were excellent she wont sit properly on the chair but shes not going to sit like that again we are teaching her to sit properly
1306451 i panicked a bit she has got her foot stuck before but we have managed to get it out she was trapped for about 10 to15 minutes

1306686 non gaap earnings was 101 000 compared to a loss of 118 000 for the same quarter in 2007 using the equivalent non gaap earnings measurement
1306687 we are pleased with the growth in our core m2m network services and connection base
1306688 while we continue to experience strong demand in our m2m business we have taken measures to safeguard our balance sheet during this period of economic uncertainty and volatile capital markets by tightening credit particularly for hardware only sales while we intensify our efforts to increase our network connections and recurring service revenues we believe the heightened demand for low margin hardware created by the analog to digital transition during 2007 and this year is substantially behind us and even though demand for certain hardware and module components has softened our opportunity funnel and sales pipeline for our core m2m network services remains solid
1306689 despite the continued growth in our business it is becoming increasingly difficult to forecast m2m revenues at this time we cannot affirm our overall m2m revenue growth estimates of 30 to 40 until we can more clearly determine the potential impact of current economic conditions yet in spite of this uncertainty we expect improved financial performance in the second half of the year as a result of a change in the mix of hardware and service revenues a reduction in overheads and continued cost control
1306690 it is gratifying that a publication with crns depth of channel leadership would select rebit as one of its top 25

1306699 in view of the downturn being experienced by our industry our on going cost control measures continued to prove their effectiveness in the current quarter
1306700 we are continuing to make progress with our penetration of the stand alone optical cd market during the quarter we concluded successful stand alone evaluations at two different fabs and we are now beginning to recognize revenues from the sales of these systems in parallel to this success proving the strong capabilities and the growing interest for our stand alone metrology products we placed new evaluation systems at two additional customer sites
1306701 although the current weak market conditions appear likely to persist until the end of the year we are taking advantage and enhancing our market position by developing new applications and penetrating new customers we believe that our strong execution and tight cost controls combined with our solid progress in the stand alone optical cd area will help us to outperform the industry and emerge from the downturn a stronger company with improved revenue mix and customer presence and a broader suite of products and applications

1306768 audacious bid to rescue the economy and his job as leader
1306769 we held extensive talks with all broadcasters and were determined to be as flexible as possible in terms of our packaging and scheduling to allow the maximum number of bids for cricket from all areas of the broadcast industry
1306770 the ecb recognise and are grateful for sky sports loyalty to the sport both at home and when the england team tour overseas
1306771 the squad is made up of the players who have done so well for us over the past year and we have every confidence that they will regain the number one ranking on the reliance mobile odi standings from australia
1306772 the only player who is no longer part of the mix is charl langeveldt who is no longer available
1306773 we have included hashim amla as the 15th player in the squad because of the heavy workload that graeme smith has had to carry and the injuries he has suffered recently
1306774 hashim played in our most recent odi series against bangladesh and he will provide the cover in the opening batting area
1306775 the names theyre the names youve heard menez and benayoun are both top class players
1306776 menez is strong and hes done some things during this past season
1306777 when theres less pressure on the coach he should know when the right moment is to change players
1306778 it is not true that i am about to leave anfield
1306779 all we can do now is get our heads down and be fit and ready for the 2009 campaign
1306780 if you look at it from public finance weve put 500million into elite sports and what weve got to try and do is make sure theres a recovery of that in terms of the outcomes
1306781 it wasnt a target that we put to uk sport uk sport themselves decided thats what we should expect from the amount of investment thats gone in
1306782 every games is a games in its own right and you want to see success i think that we would hope to see that expectation met
1306783 i think people have recognised the amount of investment that has gone into sport over the last 10 years but they will certainly measure that by outcomes and thats why these games will be important because weve handed the opportunity to give the athletes time to train
1306784 i think it was one of the archers who said to me that he had to work full time couldnt spend the time on training and has now been able to do that through the funding hes got from uk sport so these are the sort of things that we have to turn into something real
1306785 i went to mission 2012 with uk sport a few weeks ago and weve said to sports that public investment needs a return its a very strict contract that exists between uk sport and each of the individual sports
1306786 obviously we have to evaluate what the reasons are but if we came well short of that 41 medal haul wed be very concerned about that and wed look to the future
1306787 we will have a review immediately after beijing on the investment that we put in with uk sport and looking at those sports that have been successful and those that havent
1306788 i think so thats one of the reasons for having the review immediately after beijing because we start the next phase of funding for the next four years and obviously we want to support those sports that are going to do well
1306789 very much so you look at cycling cycling decided 10 years ago to have a fresh look at their sport what they needed to do and i think thats been true of most sports
1306790 i wouldnt consider another option in south africa the sharks is my home where i grew up but this is a unique opportunity as young guy to broaden my horizons
1306791 i want to emphasise the point that i am not turning my back on the sharks or springbok rugby this is a unique opportunity for me as a young player to grow and improve by playing in different conditions
1306792 from a team perspective losing brad is a big blow for all of us
1306793 he is an outstanding super 14 player a good guy with great leadership qualities but we are not going to hold him back he could even be back in a few years to play for us
1306794 he is still young enough to return to us and become a very valuable member for the sharks
1306795 i was delighted with his run in the sussex stakes but ryan moore felt he just didnt quite get home
1306796 he seems to have come out of his race fine and roy carter who rides him at home says the horse has improved again
1306797 we are considering supplementing him on thursday for this sundays prix maurice de gheest but will look at the ground we wouldnt want it to be soft over there but im keen to go if possible

1306801 of course we want to compete with them but first of all we have to think about the match that we have to play on thursday
1306802 the city has some of the worst congestion in china we were worried there would be traffic difficulties and also that the crowds would be too large
1306803 its a way to encourage the victims to rebuild the torch is a symbol of strength and will encourage them to carry on the tenacious struggle
1306804 this year our focus has been on the olympic games we have been busy organising the olympic games quest for schools so there was no time for other activity but we generally associate ourselves with activities that promote sports it has a very positive fallout
1306805 which indian viceroys son known as neville took part in the london olympic games in 1908
1306806 the changes that are occurring in china are a microcosm of the changes in the rest of the world
1306807 the humiditys quite fun its like rowing through a steam bath
1306808 the risks were obvious and should have been assessed a little more carefully the result is there was a crisis affecting the games
1306809 in my country and in many other countries in my part of the world we were in full boycott mode
1306810 public opinion and political opinion was moving toward an actual boycott of the games and it was only the earthquake tragedy that diverted attention from what could otherwise have been something very very serious
1306811 its been done and resolved and we escaped this disaster
1306812 we respect protests and freedom of expression but violence is against the olympic spirit
1306813 we believe in the strong symbolism of the torch relay
1306814 he noted the relay was also disrupted in italy before the 2006 winter games in turin by anti globalization demonstrators and protesters opposed to road construction projects in the region
1306815 it is illusory to think the simple elimination of the international relay will make all the problems disappear
1306816 the torch relay attracts the media and the media attracts the protesters to make it only a national relay will not solve all the problems
1306817 after these incidents we are convinced more than ever that we need to cherish and preserve the flame
1306818 we must make all efforts to make sure these incidents are never repeated again it is a hope i dont know if it will become a reality
1306819 i am convinced the games will be a great success and will be well organized
1306820 a means to an end but my mental health i feel like is a lot more important thats a helluva lot of money moneys good moneys a necessity but its not everything i cant put a price tag on my mental state
1306821 kevin pietersen now stands at a crossroads in his life as well as his career
1306822 being england captain will take up more time than he can imagine and he will need to reconsider his whole outlook
1306823 within the game worldwide he has a reputation as being an individual but to be successful a leader must be a giver not a taker to his team fringe players sponsors the public everyone

1306827 i feel like im in the niagara river in a boat and i dont have a motor and i dont have an oar and im getting pretty close to the falls
1306828 im drifting drifting drifting and its gone on for 40 years as far as energy is concerned were dead in the water if we dont do anything
1306829 this is the last chance for me im 80 and i have the money to do this
1306830 its not anything for boone pickens to make money i got plenty of money
1306831 do not have much of an energy plan for the short term and the short term has to be addressed
1306832 ive been an oilman my whole life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of and i have a plan in the coming weeks im going to share the details of that plan to use american technology and alternative energy to slash our dependency and break foreign oils stranglehold on us
1306833 hes making us think different about an energy policy thats been stuck in neutral for seven years
1306834 people want to have a car that shows off their status in society no one wants to buy small
1306835 the hike in fuel prices last month has done little to damp soaring diesel demand
1306836 you get less house and property for the same price but were willing to make that sacrifice to save on gas prices and commuting costs
1306837 there is a whole confluence of government policies tax spending regulatory and administrative that have subsidized sprawl
1306838 if you dont have gas you cant get to work and if you cant get to work you dont get paid and if you dont get paid you cant buy food were at their mercy
1306839 im a very small businessman if i get any smaller ill be out of business
1306840 one of the most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced
1306841 the strategic oil reserve exists for americas national security strategy not barack obamas election strategy
1306842 some of the very aggressive elements that ive outlined in my plan
1306843 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good here and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for moving us in the direction of energy independence then thats something im open to
1306844 i wanted to send a strong signal that we cant allow partisan bickering or the desire to score political points to get in the way of providing some genuine relief to people who are struggling
1306845 i want to be absolutely clear to everybody about this if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas prices by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it
1306846 drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect from a drilling agenda
1306847 i also recognize that in the house and the senate there are republicans who have very clear ideas about what they want and at some point people are going to have to make some decisions do we want to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done
1306848 this is the inevitable consequence of the high fuel costs
1306849 when you put an airplane on the ground you stop consuming fuel so theres an immediate benefit
1306850 we need to take action now to expand domestic oil production
1306851 with this action the executive branchs restrictions on this exploration have been cleared away this means that the only thing standing between the american people and these vast oil resources is action from the u s congress
1306852 people who tell us that the solution to our problem is drilling offshore are peddling our addiction
1306853 the drug is oil and they dont want us to get off it
1306854 would merely prolong the failed energy policies we have seen from washington for 30 years
1306855 if we can show that we have significant oil reserves off our coasts that will clearly affect the futures market and affect the price of oil
1306856 perhaps the only thing more outrageous than exxon mobil making record profits while americans are paying record prices at the pump is the fact that senator mccain has proposed giving them an additional 1 2 billion tax break
1306857 instead of an energy policy that reads like an oil company wish list its time to create a new american energy economy by investing in alternative energy creating millions of new jobs increasing fuel efficiency standards and ending the tyranny of oil once and for all
1306858 it brings government greed and more taxes limits access to resources and increases oil service cost inflation
1306859 we continue to invest at record levels to bring new supplies to the market
1306860 technological advances have allowed us to explore oil offshore in ways that protect the environment
1306861 could produce enough oil to match americas current production for almost 10 years
1306862 the american people are saying loud and clear there is no ambiguity about it they want us to do something about it and they understand the laws of supply and demand
1306863 if theres a call for service departments are going to go
1306864 the consumption of gas for some agencies has been a tremendous burden when you look at the larger agencies were looking at thousands and thousands of dollars per month that is just not in the budget
1306865 when the prices exploded it wasnt as bad as it could have been
1306866 when fuel starts going up and the budget gets tighter you cant spend what you dont have
1306867 we believe that gas prices are never going to go back down significantly so we need to make it a long term priority not just quick fix kind of thinking
1306868 technological advances have allowed us to explore oil offshore in ways that protect the environment
1306869 could produce enough oil to match americas current production for almost 10 years
1306870 the american people are saying loud and clear there is no ambiguity about it they want us to do something about it and they understand the laws of supply and demand
1306871 what took the market down was fannie and freddie and then we were still rocking back and then the oil came in and knocked the market down and the market still rallied back so i think today was a very good day for the market and hopefully well keep it up
1306872 i guess there are some parties out there that think that some type of conflict is inevitable because of this latest event or its drawing closer itll be more difficult to avoid
1306873 when you walked on the kitchen floor in wintertime you got cold feet
1306874 its surprising but i think that people are afraid to spend the money that initial outlay of cash is difficult under the current economic situation
1306875 the optimum months are as soon as the rain starts in early october through december deciduous trees you would want to plant after they go dormant and have lost their leaves
1306876 they dont need to be that close to the house to prevent wind
1306877 any time materials can be layered more protection will be afforded
1306878 the bad news is it was expectations of a slower global economy that drove prices lower
1306879 the latest pmi data signaled that the global service sector took a turn for the worse in june with activity and new business declining for the first time in five months and leading to further job losses
1306880 theres a lot of emotion theres a lot of huge volatility and its kind of challenging to figure out how to play here or how to sort through all the emotion if you will and the psychology
1306881 no one foresaw that china would grow at a 10 percent annual rate for over a decade commodity producers just didnt invest enough
1306882 you had a long period of underinvestment in these industries
1306883 the accelerating growth in india and china eliminated the overhang
1306884 i think there was sort of a feeling that things had come off the boil a bit as they came into trading this morning but again the iranian factors obviously havent changed all that much and the worry still remains
1306885 on a traders mind its still a real possibility that an attack can occur
1306886 the market right now is concerned about whether the government will or wont use their strategic petroleum reserve as a last policy option
1306887 the market is very nervous and could move in either direction and when it moves it doesnt move by pennies nickels and dimes now it moves by dollars
1306888 the only thing working in the stock market is anything related to commodities and oil
1306889 the first half of the quarter was fairly optimistic it looked like the economy was firming up a bit and consumers were coming back
1306890 now weve ended the quarter with a fairly tremendous burst of pessimism
1306891 certainly not in the third quarter and not anytime soon
1306892 i dont know why small caps are doing well i would be reluctant to hop on them
1306893 were going to have less airlines one way or another either we will have consolidation at some point or certain airlines will got out of business
1306894 at these high oil prices we cannot support the size of the industry that we have now we have too many airlines with too many seats and too many hubs
1306895 were spending a lot of time rethinking what that model what the industry model looks like and how you make it work at those levels
1306896 the survivors will be the ones that will be the most nimble in adapting the ones that have the most cash reserves and have the best cost structure
1306897 we would like to retain the lease program but the economic realities means its just not possible
1306898 leasing was a great advantage when you could get more car for less money at a better term but that doesnt exist anymore
1306899 i have got to get rid of this inventory and move out the 2008s and then we can figure out something for august sales
1306900 everyone is trying to get in now on a three year lease hoping that chrysler financial will get back in the game by the time their lease is done
1306901 we are seeing many people either keep the same vehicle they have or go up a vehicle
1306902 gareth will lead the team out on saturday against preston im sure he will grow into the role
1306903 its a role that i think he deserves having been a fantastic servant to ipswich town
1306904 i am very pleased so many young people in inverclyde have performed well in their national examinations this year and i would like to congratulate them on their efforts
1306905 i would also like to offer a word of commiseration to those young people who have not quite achieved what they were hoping for
1306906 i am sure they will have further opportunities to obtain the qualifications they need to pursue their chosen career paths
1306907 these results reflect well on the standard of teaching in inverclyde schools and the dedication of our staff in helping our young people achieve their potential
1306908 we are really delighted with this years results the overall attainment of our young people is once again a really positive picture
1306909 a really pleasing feature is that the high pass rate in english and mathematics has continued this year in previous years this level of performance has always been better than our comparator authorities
1306910 if they can utilize the airport with a full functioning aircraft that means loaded with as many people as its designed to hold put enough fuel on it to get to where they need to go to do business which they cannot necessarily do right now thats a big plus
1306911 my teacher was lester godinho from whom i learnt to play drums i wanted to try my hand at other percussion instruments so i tried the tabla and really loved the sound
1306912 i got my first break as a percussionist with goas sensational latino band obligato now i play african drums and a whole lot of unconventional percussion instruments
1306913 this band is led by goan bassplayer colin dcruz i have been associated with this band for over three years i travel with them all over the country and now we head for kolkata
1306914 we always wanted to create and showcase our own music
1306915 however this remained a dream because of a lack of platform to perform this only became a reality when the jw marriott hotel came up with a platform to showcase this innovative style of music
1306916 our sound is a blend of indian classical and jazz
1306917 indian classical music like jazz is all about improvisation even though it is linear and improvisations are based on one scale called raga jazz on the other hand has a broader palette where multiple scales are often used to improvise through harmonmic changes indian classical music is known to be very meloncholic whereas jazz can be extremely exuberant indian classical music however has subtle quarter tones and complex rhythm structures that add a whole new dimension to jazz
1306918 the idea is to have an informal atmosphere like a living room where you have these musicians hanging around and jamming it has been extremely well recieved and a lot of people actually hang around and listen they connect with us
1306919 for preventing the children of poor people in ireland from being a burden to their parents or country and for making them beneficial to the public
1306920 is expected to be placed under a multi agency public protection arrangement which is designed to supervise sex offenders
1306921 i believe that whichever one of the american candidates is elected for president they will succeed in passing soon sometime early next year an immigration reform
1306922 substantial improvement in the management of that problem for both countries
1306923 just like i dont think you can say sen mccain doesnt want the votes of german americans in milwaukee because he hasnt been to germany yet
1306924 i assure you obama is interested in a good relationship with mexico and a positive relationship with the hispanic community in our own country
1306925 north is haifa bay with israels most busy seaport currently closed because of the rockets assault by hezbollah on the right the bahai shrine is visible down at the port the big long grey building is a grain chamber further west on the horizon is a big white building rambam hospital with state of the art facilities to treat explosion traumas on the mountain further west is the neighbourhood of stella maris famous with tourists for its carmelite monastery and breathtaking view a rocket exploded there recently
1306926 for once you have tasted flight you will walk the earth with your eyes turned skywards for there you have been and there you will long to return
1306927 vrmag issue 30 is online with speed racer and much more
1306928 in the absence of any additional crude supply for every 1 percent of crude demand we will expect a 20 percent increase in price in order to balance the market
1306929 were striving for stable oil prices there are many reasons for the problem and its causes and our view is that it needs cooperation from all sides in many areas its not possible for just one side to provide the solution for this problem
1306930 the main factors behind the rise today are the u s dollar remains fragile and geopolitical tensions particularly surrounding iran
1306931 we would not expect liquidity to be much better this week as it will be a short trading week due to the july 4 weekend
1306932 there are people in our caucus who believe the cftc is not doing everything it should be doing
1306933 a fair amount of a lack of confidence in certain segments of the congress with the cftc
1306934 the fact that the cftc has refused to recognize that there is any speculative component at all to the rise in oil prices despite what we believe is overwhelming testimony to the contrary indicates that they need this push
1306935 they are out of touch with the economic pain that the american people are feeling we dont see them addressing this issue with the urgency thats required
1306936 its a confluence of long running events all coming to a head at the same time its not pretty
1306937 the market was probably right on the edge of having a big move down anyway all it needed was a little nudge
1306938 were going to be paying higher costs across the board whether you pay it in the form of a surcharge or you pay it in the form of higher prices
1306939 wed better get used to it and we better start budgeting for it
1306940 it makes it very difficult for consumers to comparison shop and understand the full price of the products that theyre buying
1306941 the total price of a product or service is a key factor in any purchase and is something that needs to be disclosed to consumers upfront
1306942 any business intending to collect an added fee for fuel or energy must disclose those charges when they advertise their prices
1306943 there was no way around we waited for a really long time
1306944 we deal with all types of calls from insurance and vacation planning to emergencies that require an immediate response
1306945 flat tires dead batteries and accidents necessitate customer service that can handle a large volume of roadside assistance calls all year round when drivers have a problem its our goal to get them back on the road fast and avaya helps us do this
1306946 so like everyone else gas prices are impacting us and we need to be smart about how we spend money
1306947 we are always looking for ways to improve customer service
1306948 with avaya iq we can see which agencies are serving customers effectively and where improvements are needed this helps us better allocate resources for improving customer service
1306949 now we can easily track down and rectify problematic agent behaviors
1306950 depending on what a supervisor sees like an agent hanging up excessively or putting customers on hold for too long avaya iq can identify that behavior and drill down to learn the details avaya iq eliminates the guesswork and provides the data to back it up
1306951 the great thing about avayas self service technologies is that you dont have to break the bank to be effective
1306952 we can be smart with technology to help our clients keep customers happy while keeping overall costs down
1306953 extending self service via the web we helped a game console provider build a knowledge database over 5 years
1306954 our customer service ratings with them are very high and this is due to avaya self service helping deliver fast accurate information for people that demand instant gratification even in tough times clients want to see customer satisfaction levels trend upward and they hold us accountable
1306955 this is sort of like china putting a tax on energy consumption which would have the effect to reduce the demand for petroleum products ultimately to at least prevent further increases in the price of crude oil
1306956 it should help to bring down prices and at least prevent oil from setting a new high
1306957 its not going to make a big difference to consumption today but it makes a huge difference in the psychology of where were going to be in three to five years
1306958 and everybody all around the world will need to do more things like this
1306959 at 90 bucks a barrel congress rolled the autos for the first time in 30 years is it too much to think that congress will impose more restrictions on you if oil goes to 150 dollars a barrel
1306960 blaming speculation for the increase in energy prices is to confuse causation and correlation
1306961 congress and regulators have acted to strengthen oversight of the energy markets give the new authorities time to work
1306962 we have known since 2001 that there were problems here but weve run up against people on wall street who dont want to be helpful in policing the market
1306963 while core inflation may be barely over 2 percent thats only of solace if you dont eat or drive
1306964 people wont be able to afford what they used to afford
1306965 this has really strengthened the iranians russians and venezuelans to be more provocative in the world
1306966 whether anyone can do it or not well find out
1306967 when industries are confronted by challenges they tend to get shellshocked and step back into the foxhole
1306968 my philosophy is the opposite industries need someone to step forward and make the case when people dont understand them
1306969 this is just a return to the corporate raiding activities that were prevalent in russia in the 1990s
1306970 any other board would have dismissed its ceo a long time ago and any other 50 percent shareholder would have initiated legal action to ensure that directors perform their fiduciary responsibility
1306971 we need foreign investors that will help ensure the growth of russian companies not constrain their development
1306972 an independent head of an independent company and not a bp branch as is the case now
1306973 theres nothing different between this mania the dot com mania the real estate mania the dow jones mania of the 1920s the south sea bubble and the dutch tulip bulb mania
1306974 i dont know if you can classify it as a bubble or not
1306975 but there is no question that investor demand is having an effect on price very little of it has to do with physical supply and demand of crude oil
1306976 the bubble is superimposed on an upward trend in oil prices that has a strong foundation in reality
1306977 youve got speculation in a lot of commodities and that seems to be driving up the price
1306978 movements are dominated by momentum players who predict price changes from wednesday to friday on the basis of the price change from monday to wednesday
1306979 im not saying were running out of oil but were clearly supply constrained five and 10 years from now the price is going to be higher than 134
1306980 elevated commodity prices especially of oil and food pose a serious challenge to stable growth worldwide have serious implications for the most vulnerable and may increase global inflationary pressure
1306981 theres a danger if people say oh its the speculators
1306982 dont yet have a full understanding of what is actually happening
1306983 we are an economy that runs on petroleum some 20 million barrels of it a day that can and will change over time but it will be a very long time
1306984 wed be doing the whole country a favor if more of that oil were produced here at home
1306985 oil is being drilled right now 60 miles off the coast of florida but were not doing it the chinese are in cooperation with the cuban government even the communists have figured out that a good answer to high prices is more supply
1306986 the only people who would benefit from more oil drilling are the oil companies
1306987 they have an interest in not dramatically expanding domestic supply because that will help keep prices high
1306988 were going to push what we think is a reasonable policy that meets the challenge of global warming and 5 dollar a gallon gas
1306989 if the bush tax cuts are allowed to expire americans in the lowest tax bracket will take the biggest percentage hit
1306990 ending the tax cuts would be a staggering burden on the nations households
1306991 with fuel prices like this its going to get much worse for flyers it has to get much worse or airlines are going to continue to lose billions of dollars
1306992 people have started to cut back they are not finding the great discounts on airlines anymore
1306993 todays events are a combination of really nasty news for american consumers
1306994 when you have an employment situation like that and you see crude bounce thats shocking to anything thats going to touch the consumer
1306995 outside of anything to do with oil everything is down airlines restaurants furniture stores retailers transportation
1306996 normally prices plateau after memorial day but i dont think were going to get much relief this summer
1306997 people now realize that prices may come back down but theyre not going down to where they were
1306998 were going to have to live with higher energy prices for a while and thats affecting their behavior and what they buy and dont buy
1306999 before you just wanted the client to see your face so they would be more willing to hire you to do the job
1307000 you dont do those anymore im more apt to give them an estimate over the phone to save on gas
1307001 capacidad de nuestro equipo humano para vender productos relacionados o productos de mayor precio de nuestra amplia gama de soluciones

1307003 there are limits to which we can keep consumer prices unaffected by rising import prices
1307004 i know that the price increases we have had to announce today will not be popular even though they are only modest we remain dependent on imports we are therefore vulnerable to global trends in oil prices
1307005 this is a black day for us this is an economic terror unleashed on the people of this country
1307006 the price hike is on expected lines and was unavoidable
1307007 i was already coping with the rising prices of food and milk now i will have to conserve my cooking gas too
1307008 holds the key to reducing gasoline prices at home in the short term
1307009 increases its oil production by one million barrels per day
1307010 is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard
1307011 which recently made a major oil discovery almost in sight of rios beaches
1307012 iranian banks have been aggressive and disruptive in moving money through financial systems
1307013 taking the extraordinary step of disclosing this investigation because of todays unprecedented market conditions
1307014 the cftc must vigorously pursue all leads to protect the american people from market manipulation during a time of record prices at the pump
1307015 its not good enough to say let the markets take care of this when there is even the possibility that uneconomic forces may be at work
1307016 you can say those things when youre not running for reelection
1307017 i truly cannot believe that any vice president of the united states would make such a derogatory statement about my state or any state for that matter
1307018 on reflection he concluded that it was an inappropriate attempt at humor that he should not have made the vice president apologizes to the people of west virginia for the inappropriate remark
1307019 i dont see any substantive loss other than on the prestige
1307020 they have been an oil importer they really have not had much influence within the opec organization
1307021 if we remain in opec there is some obligation from other members if problems arise to assist us
1307022 after a particular peformance sometime ago a guest walked up to me with an irresistable offer he said he could put me through to sting and that the rock icon was looking to perform with an indian band
1307023 we will perform our own compositions at the concerts including the popular number mumbai jumbo right now we are in the process of working out the details with stings agent
1307024 there are red indians but had christopher colombus got his navigation right hed have discovered us brown indians first we feel its high time we take pride in our skin colour
1307025 in goa over the next two months the stretch between calangute and baga sees about 3 000 live music performances every night
1307026 mumbai was once like that with jazz playing at gaylord oberoi the taj berrys venice talk of the town and more
1307027 it should be renamed anything but jazz by the bay
1307028 now its all about fashion shows and brand launches but before the page 3 culture hit people wanted to be seen at jazz concerts
1307029 the same police act book that deals with crimes like kidnapping theft and murder addresses something as innocent as singing and dancing as if its a crime to have a good time is it a crime to sing should i need a licence or police permission to dance
1307030 we need the same permission as that required for a full scale concert car parking and electrical and fire clearances the rules are no different for small little bars that want a pianist
1307031 the number of jazz concerts in the city has gone down the main reason is hindi pop with the likes of himesh reshammiya making crores of rupees
1307032 you cant open just a jazz caf it wont work
1307033 jazz utsav might draw more people because it is a free event but the fact that the other event is on the same night is very sad for the jazz crowd in mumbai its disheartening that jazz lovers will have to choose
1307034 those familiar with the artists will make sure they come as it is a once in a lifetime opportunity i would also have loved to be there for the jazz utsav but unfortunately they clash
1307035 the only families that would have difficulty would be the ones who have poor credit
1307036 increased end user awareness and ongoing advances in technology are helping shape better products and services
1307037 kazeons information server is bringing significant improvements in both functionality and cost to an already crowded information access amp management market

1307039 the recognition of kazeons information server as a top product by network products guide is a great testament to kazeons leadership presence in the information access amp management space
1307040 the integration of vidyos breakthrough technology into shoretels unified communications product line allows us to offer our customers the ability to make simple and natural video calls
1307041 because of vidyos svc based architecture video can be transmitted and received with minimum delay eliminating distance as an impediment to face to face conversations now its easier than ever for users across the enterprise to communicate and collaborate effectively
1307042 in the past cost effective high quality video conferencing over general purpose ip networks was not possible because available bandwidth cannot be guaranteed and both processing power and display resolutions at endpoints are variable
1307043 vidyotechnology allows unified communication vendors to offer better video quality at much lower price points than traditional solutions we are excited that shoretel recognizes the significance of this breakthrough technology
1307044 in building a new convergence infrastructure and supporting communications applications our primary concerns were seamless integration performance and having a strong relationship and understanding with our vendors
1307045 with avaya extreme networks and empire technologies we satisfied this need in terms of productivity and response time we are seeing a 50 75 percent improvement in our staffs response time to vendor calls and inquiries from residents that adds up and definitely affects the bottom line in a positive way
1307046 middletown represents a terrific example of how extreme networks and avaya provide a network foundation and feature rich communication solutions that positively impact the daily operations for our government customers
1307047 this results in a dependable converged system able to support their mission critical applications while delivering higher value and greater productivity for employees
1307048 after learning more about what the township wanted to accomplish we thought an extreme data solution was the perfect answer and the middletown township team agreed
1307049 to serve our customers and enable them to reap the benefits of ip telephony such as improved customer service its important that we integrate with and support product lines from vendors such as extreme networks
1307050 avaya is focused on building a reliable ubiquitous secure open standards based communication foundation across the variety of networks and technologies that our customers use

1307058 le fait dint grer les notions de politique des prix des concurrents ainsi que de comportement dachat de la client le est une approche novatrice et tr s prometteuse de loptimisation du revenu et du contr le dinventaire des places
1307059 a notre connaissance thalys va d sormais b n ficier dun des syst mes doptimisation du revenu les plus avanc s actuellement disponibles sur le march quand il sagit de repr senter de mani re efficace la demande du client et les diff rents types de comportements de choix ceci est particuli rement important dans lenvironnement commercial de thalys qui propose un nombre important de liaisons ses passagers jusqu 30 par jour sur les lignes les plus emprunt es avec des gammes tarifaires bien d finies et diff renci es en raison du nombre dalternatives possibles pour le client les approches classiques de gestion du revenu bas es sur des mod les de demande ind pendants ne fonctionnent pas dans ce contexte
1307060 la d r glementation et la privatisation continuent renforcer la concurrence parmi les op rateurs de train grande vitesse en europe
1307061 ceci les oblige r agir et devenir proactifs puisquils ont faire des conditions de march aussi dynamiques et changeantes que celles du domaine a rien nous sommes donc heureux de joindre nos forces celles de thalys international pour les aider dans ce domaine et nous sommes convaincus que notre contribution leur permettra de se maintenir dans leur position de leader du march
1307062 la technologie dexpretio nous permettra dacc l rer le transfert modal du transport a rien au transport ferroviaire des passagers surtout lorsque nos nouvelles lignes de trains grande vitesse en direction damsterdam et de cologne seront op rationnelles
1307063 nous appr cions beaucoup la r activit et le respect des d lais dexpretio qui permettront notre quipe de gestion du revenu de se familiariser avec loutil avant linauguration des nouvelles lignes thalys pourra galement mettre en place sous peu une nouvelle et plus flexible structure d valuation pour lensemble de ses lignes de chemin de fer
1307064 customers transferring from commercial to conduction cooled requirements demanded the migration path offered with xport1003
1307065 the hardware and software commonality make this migration painless and reduces customer time to market and time to revenue
1307066 integrating notions of competitor pricing and customer purchasing behavior is a novel and very promising approach to revenue optimization and inventory control
1307067 to our knowledge thalys will now benefit from one of the most advanced revenue optimization systems commercially available today when it comes to efficiently modelling customer demand and choice behaviour patterns this is particularly important in thalys commercial environment as it offers a high number of links to its passengers up to 30 per day on the most important markets together with well defined and differentiated families of fare products because of the number of alternatives available to the customer classical revenue management approaches based on independent demand models demand simply do not work in that context
1307068 deregulation and privatization continue to drive competitiveness among high speed train operators in europe
1307069 this forces them to react and become proactive as they must deal with market conditions that are as dynamic and volatile as those in the airline industry we are therefore happy to join forces with thalys international to help them in this regard and are confident that our contribution will allow them to maintain a dominant market position
1307070 we are confident that expretios technology will allows us to accelerate the modal shift from air to rail passenger transportation especially once our new high speed lines towards amsterdam and cologne will become operational
1307071 we greatly appreciate expretios fast response and timely delivery which will allow our yield management team to become familiar prior to inaugurating the new lines and also allow thalys to implement shortly a new more flexible pricing structure for all of its rail lines
1307072 this is the opportunity of a lifetime for zap and we are ready to seize the moment
1307073 we were pleased to report recently that our andes phase 3 clinical trial of agi 1067 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes met the primary endpoint and showed a dose response in reducing a1c a key measure of blood glucose control
1307074 based on the results of this successful trial atherogenics intends to rapidly move forward with development of agi 1067
1307075 our results this quarter in our lasik businesses were significantly impacted by the weak economy as evidenced by a consumer confidence index that has declined to a level not seen since the early 1990s
1307076 in the first quarter we recorded strong growth in all three of our refractive center patient acquisition channels and posted record results
1307077 it is also important to remember that approximately 30 of our business volume is in non discretionary sectors which are less susceptible to economic pressures those businesses continue to show solid growth we continue to remain focused on managing costs paying down debt and delivering the best clinical care in the industry
1307078 if you cant say anything nice dont say anything at all
1307079 i think what were seeing on a national basis and it applies locally is donor fatigue
1307080 there are a lot of organizations out there going after charitable dollars and with economic times being what they are people have begun to scale back
1307081 weve made very conservative estimates were being very realistic about what people are going to be able to do
1307082 new hampshire has a huge amount of nonprofits in an economy where i think theres shrinking revenue period
1307083 were all going after these donors and theres only so much to go around
1307084 if people really believe in your mission they will give weve seen that in very bad economic times as well as really good times

1307352 unless there is a radical transformation of existing business processes well in advance of any collaborative programme then a project is doomed to failure before it has even started collaboration introduces an entirely new way of working and this has a direct impact on the way people work how they interact with it and how they are trained businesses need to understand all these facets before undertaking a project of this nature user buy in is an absolute pre requisite to success
1307353 it policies also need to be reviewed this must encompass issues such as the appropriate use of email and instant messaging technologies as well as ensuring that the organisation has the capability to archive and monitor all communications
1307354 collaborative solutions should in fact eradicate the need for this sort of communications technology as everything can be captured on the collaboration platform which in turn will support many aups
1307355 collaborative solutions enable individuals and groups to interact in real time and keep a record of whatever they discuss and agree to do increased levels of communication and co operation between your employees partners and customers drives any organisation towards an anytime anywhere culture that delivers tangible business benefits
1307356 start with one technology area and then expand to others alternatively start with one business process and then add in others applying the collaborative technology as and when you assess the success of the initial projects the third option is to start with one business unit or group before large scale roll out
1307357 critical to this however is user acceptance and that will mean the radical transformation of traditional mindsets in a number of business areas not least human resources and the way employees interact the answer be prepared

1307382 in our report we said the government needs to look at more preventative measures in schools ed balls the secretary of state for children schools and families office has been quite receptive about our findings
1307383 what perpetrators do is make women feel like its their fault and its often a wearing down over a period of time women arent always aware that theres a pattern or recognise these problems so anything that alerts women is a good thing then at least you can be aware and equip yourself
1307384 we need more prevention rather than just picking up the pieces research says that it takes on average 35 beatings before a woman seeks help thats a long way down the road we need to start long before that

1307449 as our data shows in these current market conditions more people are struggling to meet their mortgage payments and it is vital that firms treat them fairly
1307450 this means paying attention to their individual circumstances and not repossessing their homes when there may be an alternative solution repossession has to be the last resort
1307451 we call on the fsa to take urgent action on the findings of their research if the worst consequences of the deepening mortgage crisis are to be avoided
1307452 we believe this should involve strengthening the rules on mortgage arrears and lending practices we also call on the government to introduce a mortgage pre action protocol as soon as possible to ensure that lenders only take possession action as a last resort

1307482 weve had talks and the barclays premier league is the one were after we want to get that back
1307483 and over the course of the season to show that consistency and get that back off man united would be fantastic
1307484 they have had two good years and you have to stand back and take your hat off to them but we know we were good last year and we have another level to go to
1307485 last year i think we saw the very best of man united but we have got an awful lot to come from last year
1307486 we have got improvements to make but i think man united are at their peak
1307487 the premier league is the one we want and when the champions league starts again its going to be exciting
1307488 pre season has been good it has been very different actually

1307496 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1307497 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1307498 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
1307499 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
1307500 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

1307507 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men

1307509 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
1307510 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
1307511 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
1307512 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law

1307589 speeding is clearly a major cause of accidents especially on the a1307 and we need to tackle it speed cameras are clearly a part of that

1307674 the answer to providing high quality universal health care for everyone in the united states is to americanize it by this we mean let that which is uniquely american drive us toward our ideal while we discard the socialized european style health care reforms of the last 25 years the stakes are high if we get this wrong our tiniest infants and vulnerable children people with chronic and debilitating medical conditions and our oldest citizens will suffer needlessly or die making the wrong decision will increase future generations dependence on government and sap the economic strength of the u s economy robbing them of the benefits of prosperity and freedom if we make the right decision however our parents spouses children and grandchildren will live longer lives with reduced pain and suffering moreover they will enjoy an expanding base of economic benefits and increased liberty

1307677 i also noted to the governors that over the longer term the best way to respond to the food and fuel crisis is to increase food supply conserve energy and develop new energy sources
1307678 i also had very fruitful bilateral meetings with president sidi mohamed ould cheikh abdallahi prime minister yahya ould ahmed el waghef and governor kane i reiterated the funds strong support for the authorities emergency food security program and commended the comprehensive and proactive stance that they have taken to address this critical issue i encouraged them to closely monitor the food security situation and further expand domestic production i also congratulated the authorities on the significant progress they have made in implementing an ambitious program of economic reform the fund supports these efforts under a poverty reduction and growth facility prgf program which aims to speed up economic growth reduce unemployment and raise the standard of living for the mauritanian people
1307679 w nschenswert w re jedoch schon dar ber nachzudenken wie man im alter leben m chte solange man noch fit ist
1307680 neben den herk mmlichen optionen wie altenheim pflegeheim und seniorenresidenz gibt es das betreute wohnen und die betreute alten wohngemeinschaft
1307681 hier sollte man sich vorher genau erkundigen wie die bedingungen sind und wer die betreuung leistet
1307682 einen guten pflegedienst erkennt man an einer ausf hrlichen beratung und daran ob ein kostenvoranschlag und ein pflegevertrag erstellt werden
1307683 eine t gliche teilwaschung kann meist durch leistungen der gesetzlichen pflegeversicherung in stufe i von 420 euro gedeckt werden
1307684 tritt ein konkreter pflegefall ein ist es wichtig sich als pflegender angeh riger ber entlastungsm glichkeiten zu informieren bevor die eigenen kr fte aufgebraucht sind und die eigene gesundheit schaden genommen hat
1307685 wir pflegen interessenvertretung f r begleitende angeh rige und freunde in deutschland
1307686 die verhinderungspflege steht jedem der einer pflegestufe zugeordnet ist zu
1307687 der medizinische dienst pr ft ob ein anspruch vorhanden ist diese leistung wird auch ohne pflegestufe bewilligt
1307688 pflegende angeh rige sollten sich ein netzwerk an helfern aufbauen um zu verhindern dass sie ihren job aufgeben m ssen
1307689 bei der auswahl eines heims kommt es vor allem auf die qualit t der betreuung und die menschliche atmosph re der einrichtung an heime die eine betreuung in wohngruppen anbieten sind derzeit sicher die beste wahl aber auch hier kommt es darauf an genau hinzuschauen

1307691 ich baue auf mein urteilsverm gen ich bin berzeugt zu 95 prozent merke ich wenn der andere l gt das hat mich meine jahrelange erfahrung mit fast t glichen interviews gelehrt
1307692 das aber war eine klare voraussetzung f r diese stelle und wir hatten ihn explizit danach befragt er hatte uns frech angelogen
1307693 da erkl rt ein bewerber mehrere mitarbeiter gef hrt zu haben in wahrheit war es ein einziger auszubildender
1307694 es kommt ganz darauf an wie dick aufgetragen wird wenn ein bewerber f lschlicherweise erkl rt 100 mitarbeiter gef hrt zu haben und in der praxis versagt kann das zu hohem schaden im unternehmen f hren
1307695 auch bei arbeitszeugnissen ist die kreativit t gro da werden aus anderthalb seiten mal eben zwei und die unterschrift wird gef lscht mit fantasienamen oder auch dem des vorstandes obwohl der kaum ein arbeitszeugnis unterschreiben w rde es sei denn er w re der unmittelbare vorgesetzte gewesen damit sind wir bei urkundenf lschung
1307696 die leute werden opfer ihrer gewohnheit sie werfen einen blick auf den kalender tragen das aktuelle datum ein und vergessen dass zeugnisse nicht an sonn oder feiertagen ausgestellt werden
1307697 es ging darum entsprechen alle angaben der wahrheit ja oder nein
1307698 die l ge beim bewerbungsverfahren ist somit oft der erste schritt in eine kriminelle karriere und die kommt die unternehmen teuer zu stehen
1307699 gerade am anfang wird nicht nach den entscheidenden kriterien gefragt
1307700 ich streite diese menschenkenntnis ab man kann nur bis zur stirn sehen
1307701 da hat etwa jemand eine straftat begangen und es kommt zum prozess vorher besorgt er sich noch schnell ein f hrungszeugnis macht sich immer gut bei bewerbungen denn er wei nat rlich erst nach der verurteilung erfolgt der eintrag ins f hrungszeugnis einen tag davor ist das noch bl tenwei
1307702 ihr potenzieller arbeitgeber darf sie nur zu einer vorstrafe in bezug auf ihr angestrebtes t tigkeitsfeld befragen dar ber hinaus ist seine frage unzul ssig und sie haben das recht zur l ge wenn sie also eine k rperverletzung begangen haben ist ein kindergarten wohl nicht der passende arbeitsplatz f r sie bei verm gensdelikten sollten sie sich nicht bei banken oder finanzdienstleistern bewerben
1307703 dazu gab es im letzten jahr gerade ein urteil ein b rsenbroker ist bei seiner bewerbung nach etwaigen vergehen im b rsenumfeld gefragt worden und hatte auf diese frage hin verschwiegen dass gegen ihn ein verfahren wegen finanzieller manipulation eingeleitet worden war und dass dies auch der grund f r seine vorausgegangene k ndigung war er hatte deswegen sogar ein arbeitsrechtliches verfahren gegeben das er verloren hatte der b rsenbroker wurde eingestellt die sache kam raus und seine k ndigung war rechtens
1307704 ich beschreibe in meinem buch die unterschiede zwischen unwahrheiten und wie man sich bei bewerbungen grunds tzlich von seiner besten seite zeigt aber auch wo die grenzen zum kriminellen liegen etwa bei der f lschung von zeugnissen und dokumenten das ist schlichtweg kriminell das propagiere ich nat rlich nicht
1307705 das gesamtbild ist entscheidend und nicht ob jemand vielleicht mal eine kreative pause gebraucht hat nat rlich frage ich bei l cken im lebenslauf nach und lasse mir die umst nde erkl ren
1307706 wer einen mehrmonatigen auslandsaufenthalt angibt und dazu erkl rt die zeit genutzt zu haben um seine sprachkenntnisse zu verbessern der kann das ja in der praxis belegen gerade bei der angabe von fremdsprachen sind unwahrheiten schnell festzustellen

1307731 to go higher i think we need the sentiment to change with lower energy prices crude oil dropping below the 117 area certainly would provide a very visible benefit in terms of the economy but it also makes the problems seems a little bit less severe
1307732 were kind of going through a period of healing and trying to maybe etch out some kind of bottom
1307733 a lot of times you just dont reach a bottom and go straight up
1307734 almost all the dealers are offering up to 50 percent off their merchandise so that they wont have to move as much
1307735 well have everything we have now only in a smaller space
1307736 people who used to come in a couple of times a week now come in less and ebay came along and cut into our sales

1307738 so mr gagaliss petition is alice in wonderland hes been convicted and hes now blaming everyone else
1307739 the ability to seamlessly share patient centric information between all clinical care settings of the organization is a central part of our enterprise wide information technology strategy
1307740 most importantly it is essential to our evolution as an integrated health care delivery system
1307741 this award recognizes years of collaboration and effort among all of the people who provide health care in our service area
1307742 we have made considerable progress moving towards electronic health records and specifically using information technology to help us deliver the safest possible use of medications the most wired recognition is confirmation that we are working on the right things for our patients
1307743 we were particularly pleased with our results in light of softness seen in the overall economy and the operating results of many other consumer discretionary spending companies and lodging companies our adjusted ebitda of 14 0 million for the second quarter was toward the top end of our guidance also our year to date same store revenue per available room revpar growth through june 30 which effectively normalizes results for the effect of the shift in the timing of the easter holiday and related school spring breaks for 2008 and 2007 was 4 2 percent also our june 2008 same store revpar gain was 8 1 percent over june 2007 we believe these trends show that our business model held up well throughout the first half of 2008
1307744 our portfolio results for the second quarter continue to reflect the growth and strength of our great wolf lodge brand
1307745 the second quarter marked the first full quarter with operating results of our two newest properties located in grapevine texas which opened in december 2007 and grand mound wash
1307746 we continue to monitor the marketplace for feedback from our guests regarding their experiences at our resorts to ensure that we maintain the high level of service comfort and quality that our customers expect from a great wolf lodge
1307747 in a slowing nationwide economy we remain focused on keeping our position as a preferred convenient and affordable vacation alternative for families our guests typically live within a few hours drive of our resorts which means that rising gasoline prices have only a minimal impact on the typical familys cost of a great wolf resort vacation we believe that compared to the cost and logistical challenges of air travel to a destination resort or theme park we offer a strong combination of convenience and price value for families
1307748 group bookings in the 2008 second quarter accounted for approximately 16 8 percent of our room nights sold versus 13 8 percent of room nights in the 2007 second quarter an increase of almost 15 000 group rooms
1307749 this focus on increasing group business helped expand our second quarter same store occupancy to 65 3 in 2008 from 62 0 in 2007 room rates for group business are generally lower than for our leisure customers so the increase in group business in addition to the shift in the easter holiday contributed to a decline in same store average daily rate in the 2008 second quarter as compared to last year we believe we do obtain an added benefit of what is effectively increased marketing exposure when we increase our group business however by demonstrating our unique family friendly resorts to meeting attendees
1307750 our generation i properties continue to feel the combined impact of the regional economic difficulties of the u s automobile industry and high levels of competition
1307751 we are pleased however that our generation ii resorts which better reflect our development program going forward continue to show robust same store growth and we believe their size and scale also create higher barriers to potential competition even with the shift in the easter holiday we achieved revpar growth of 4 3 percent and ancillary non rooms spending increased approximately 2 percent per occupied room
1307752 we are currently in discussions with the lenders to obtain a one year extension prior to the loans maturity date on november 30 2008
1307753 other than the mason mortgage loan the company does not expect to have any significant debt maturities until mid 2011
1307754 in todays turbulent capital markets we remain selective in our uses of capital and are extremely focused on monitoring the ongoing construction processes at our grapevine and concord resorts
1307755 also we think our prospective development strategy consisting primarily of licensing arrangements and joint ventures allows us the most efficient and effective use of our capital
1307756 assuming the extension of the mason loan we are confident that we will have sufficient liquidity to operate our business absent any significant downturn in our expected operating results
1307757 our concord resort is in the heart of a popular tourist destination which currently is undergoing significant expansion especially at the nearby lowes motor speedway
1307758 we fit in well with the mix of other hospitality and entertainment offerings many of which attract a lot of families our property will be the premier indoor waterpark destination in the carolinas with our construction financing in place we now have begun drawing down on that loan in the 2008 third quarter
1307759 we are excited about the potential prospects for each of these projects
1307760 we do not intend however to enter into any new significant capital commitments under our development program until the capital markets stabilize as these projects under letters of intent are large complex and require access to reasonably priced capital their timing is hard to predict with certainty we continue to move forward with the planning process however to position ourselves to move ahead at the appropriate time additionally we are actively involved in the evaluation process on several u s and international potential sites for future resort development we currently expect all of our future domestic and international prospects to be developed through licensing arrangements or joint ventures we continue to see these avenues as the prudent way to grow our company while maintaining reasonable overall leverage
1307761 it is clear that the leisure and hospitality sectors are feeling the impact of a softening economy
1307762 our portfolio of properties continues to post good results with occupancy revpar and revpor remaining strong year to date because of our resorts close proximity to major population centers or other tourist destinations we believe that they continue to be convenient affordable family vacation alternatives even in a tighter economy looking at trends through july we remain optimistic about our operating results for our third quarter which is traditionally our largest contributor of adjusted ebitda for the year based on our current operating outlook we are increasing the low end of our guidance for full year adjusted ebitda from 62 0 million to 63 0 million consequently our full year adjusted ebitda guidance is now a range of 63 0 70 0 million

1307772 it is important that anyone buying property do their due diligence and our job is to get the information together for them to do that due diligence

1307777 our flawed trade relationship with china is destroying good jobs in new hampshire
1307778 all manufacturing is facing a critical challenge as we know but what may surprise people is how hard workers in advanced technology are being affected
1307779 as china diversifies its export base and its already expanding its electronic products aircraft auto parts and machinery more american products will be unfairly disadvantaged
1307780 the major causes of the skyrocketing trade deficit with china are no mystery
1307781 chinas manipulation of its currency makes the yuan artificially cheap effectively subsidizing exports
1307782 beijings suppression of labor rights also lowers wages china subsidizes some key industries and maintains barriers to some imports

1307807 una lingua madre innestata con ritardo e con vero dolore una seconda nascita
1307808 perdendo la madre che si scopre che la propria lingua madre sempre gi perduta
1307809 parla di s come di un altro immagina anche se stesso per tenersi compagnia

1307815 this is fun talking to you guys imagine trying to pump up the people in sacramento
1307816 the level of pent up demand reaching the market next year is a bit uncertain and it is possible for even higher home sales activity than were forecasting if buyers regain their confidence about the long term benefits of homeownership over the near term home sales are likely to be fairly flat as the lingering impact of the credit crunch filters through the system through the end of the year
1307817 sono assolutamente daccordo con la tua analisi tuttavia il fatto che le leggi censorie siano difficilmente applicabili o non lo siano affatto non elimina lo spirito con il quale vengono proposte e qualche volta deliberate quello che se ne evince sono almeno due cose la prima la volont di controllare se non soffocare le voci non embeddate la seconda la maldestrezza e lincompetenza con la quale questi tentativi sono fatti entrambe le cose sono preoccupanti e meritano a mio avviso locchio attento di chi la rete la vive e la conosce anche perch chi invece giace imbesuito davanti a f tiche trasmissioni televisive locchio lorecchio e pure il neutrone lha disattivato da un pezzo

1307820 non so quando finir il cammino disse ma so quando cominciato e come stato il percorso e quindi naturale aspettarne una conclusione perch cos stato per tutte le cose accadute tu hai scoperto che qualcosa cambiato ma non ti rendi conto che il tuo movimento non pu rprendere perch niente inizia dalla fine se non un rinnovamento o una vera novit sei stato il motore di una corsa che ti ha portato sempre allo stesso punto e hai seguito la voglia di camminare senza una meta senza passione senza guardarti attorno girando a vuoto per riempire un vuot o il cammino arte devi pensare agli sguardi ai contatti aille passioni alle emozioni alle commozioni ai dolori alle paure ai semtimenti insomma e alle ragioni che attraversi e dai quali sei attraversato durante il tuo andare vieni con me e accompagnami per il viaggio che resta

1307855 we dont get to come to p e i too often so when we do come here we try to make as big an impact as possible and we really want to get out and see everybody on the island and were hoping that everybody can come out and see us
1307856 the more money we can provide for the foundation means the more wishes they can grant for children that need them the most to put the smile back on their faces
1307857 the endurance level is something some people dont realize i mean to run for the next five days and to be pounding on the pavement and also doing the community work that you will be doing we certainly appreciate the effort you put in

1307874 our priority is to have every student meeting or exceeding the benchmark
1307875 while we have made some gains we have a lot of work to do
1307876 this information highlights the urgent work we need to do to make sure students are meeting standards at every grade
1307877 the plan is focusing really on individual students and meeting their individual needs at the classroom level
1307878 while our scores did not make ayp it still shows that were making progress were not pleased with where were at were looking forward to making greater gains
1307879 we see more students being more successful in those climates
1307880 number one i think its important to have an external set of eyes
1307881 number two i think that this is an issue also about the community and i think we wanted some individuals who have the confidence of the community certainly former sheriff ramirez and current chief moore have a tremendous amount of expertise in running secure facilities as well as being aware of community standards and how the hospital fits into the community
1307882 i think its a great combination a great team on paper
1307883 hopefully they can really come in and tell us what we need to do now
1307884 when i go out there and visit that place last week again i just shake my head
1307885 its just so old its in very bad shape and we really need a new facility my biggest concern is that we stay on time that we get it built when we said we were going to get it built
1307886 they could not predict that in the resort they chose to spend their holidays they could place the life of any of their children in danger
1307887 the formulation of any lucid sensible serious and honest conclusion
1307888 this includes the most dramatic thing ascertaining whether she is still alive or dead which seems the most probable
1307889 the investigators are fully conscious that their work is not exempt from imperfections
1307890 they worked with an enormous margin of error and they achieved very little in terms of conclusive results especially about the fate of the unfortunate child crime scenario fit for the investigative efforts of a sherlock holmes or hercule poirot guided by the illusion that the forces of law and justice can always re establish order
1307891 we are absolutely devastated by the events of the past week and the loss of ben and catherine
1307892 we would like to thank our friends and family for their overwhelming support and kindness
1307893 certain evidence was secured but we are unable to release any details at this time as this may jeopardise the case
1307894 we have informed the defence and the court the next hearing has been set for september when this will be discussed

1307897 what was this author trying to get us to see about life
1307898 these 200 teachers will go back into their classrooms and have an impact on over 5 000 students
1307899 each student as they come in has a different need you need to have the skills to watch that child and determine what that kid needs
1307900 this is going to be a very exciting opportunity not just for public works but for the community as a whole
1307901 i feel a little rusty because its been almost a year since ive really played football
1307902 im really excited to get back and get after it
1307903 then i started getting into the flow of things and getting warmed up it was just like i was out there before i got my knee injured ive just got to run like its perfect
1307904 i definitely anticipate that im going to be the starter im just confident in myself
1307905 but im also confident in my teammates if i dont end up being the starter weve got great guys behind me
1307906 justins the only quarterback on our team thats started a game finished a game and won a game
1307907 i think for a lot of guys that are going to be seniors its a different feeling from all other fall camps that weve been to
1307908 it was a day that i never thought that id arrive at kind of deal
1307909 just seeing roper and costa today in practice were going to have a great year

1307919 it was awful none of us could play and we had no idea what we were doing
1307920 i dont think i ever thought wed still be doing it 30 years on
1307921 punk rock was just so unpopular at that time especially in pembrokeshire where being a young famer was the in thing
1307922 we got better more adept at playing the instruments and started to develop a following in the area in wales and beyond
1307923 there was a lot going on in wales in punk rock there were the partisans the solider dolls and the oppressed eight or nine bands
1307924 unfortunately at the time there was also a violent undercurrent which would manifest itself at our gigs
1307925 punk was dead if you pitched up to play a gig you would be lucky to get 20 people
1307926 bands like rancid and green day were the key for us
1307927 their fans started to look at what had gone before and wanted to know more about their influences
1307928 in bratislava about 500 kids turned up really getting into what we were doing
1307929 theres this bunch of old guys up there and they didnt care
1307930 whats great is i can honestly say ive not seen a punch thrown since we reformed its not like it was before
1307931 next year we are touring the east coast of america and all our stuff is being released over there on vinyl
1307932 it would be nice to play a few more of the indie festivals over here especially in wales but we dont get asked because people think well say no
1307933 this is a international olympic committee ioc guideline under rule 51 of the charter which states that flags which can be interpreted as a political gesture are not allowed inside any olympic venues
1307934 and as such only flags which participate in the olympic games are allowed by the ioc
1307935 the minister for heritage believes that welsh athletes should be able to fly the welsh flag on a lap of honour if they wish
1307936 this has serious implications for freedom of expression and the rights of supporters and athletes to celebrate their success
1307937 welsh medal winning athletes and their supporters have been able to wave the welsh flag at previous olympics without the threat of having them confiscated
1307938 for as long as i can remember supporters of welsh athletes have waved the welsh flag at the olympic games
1307939 along with the union flag it is an important symbol to demonstrate their pride in wales role in the british team
1307940 it concerns me that this issue has not been dealt with adequately in the years running up to the beijing games by either the ioc or the games organisers
1307941 the olympic games is about celebrating pride in national achievement and must not be allowed to become an event which seeks to suppress it
1307942 i honestly didnt expect the fire to take hold of the whole pavilion
1307943 i had absolutely no idea we were going to have a total loss
1307944 overwhelmed with goodwill from suppliers and businesses and especially the public
1307945 we have to consult with english heritage as the structure is grade ii listed and see what sort of design it will be
1307946 my brother and i believe in the pier and are committed to it
1307947 i have worked with the somerset wildlife trust and their conservation staff for nearly 20 years on this project and have found them to be highly skilled at habitat management excellent at working with the public and they have always delivered what they promised in this field these are rare commodities
1307948 repatriation is pretty much a death sentence in some of these cases
1307949 ive seen patients bundled onto the plane and out of the country and once that person is out of sight hes out of mind
1307950 what that does for us it puts a strain on our system where were unable to provide adequate care for our own citizens
1307951 an alternative choice for the care of the unfunded latin american nationals
1307952 weve done flights to lithuania poland honduras guatemala and mexico
1307953 but out of about a dozen cases a year we probably fly only a couple back
1307954 i can think of three different scenarios that would have led to a fatal outcome if they had moved her
1307955 the good outcome today is due to the treatment that the hospital provided reluctantly and sadly enough only in response to legal and public pressure
1307956 he didnt talk he didnt understand anything he stayed curled up in a ball but he was alive
1307957 i said sure what can come of such a case
1307958 then it took on a life of its own they probably regret they ever called me
1307959 the question to be answered is if the patients condition is terminal
1307960 we arrived for a visit and he said to me you are montejo
1307961 the real problem is if we find an underlying problem and now we have six of them six patients who showed up in renal failure and that we are now seeing three times a week for dialysis
1307962 a community hospital is going to give care but is it the right thing we have a lot of american citizens who need our help we only make about 3 percent over our bottom line if were lucky we need to make capital improvements and do things for our community
1307963 or the government should step in and otherwise exercise its authority for deportation or whatever it wants to do
1307964 and if the rehab worked then luis might have become a functional person and nobodys charge
1307965 once you take that step for how long are you going to do that a year 10 years 50 years
1307966 informed us of how expensive it was becoming to care for luis given that there was no insurance and that he is illegal and that the state wont assume responsibility for his charges
1307967 if a hospital in florida asks if we can take care of a guatemalan patient the tendency is to say yes
1307968 this case is not simply a case as some would try and paint it of money this is a case about care for a man in this country illegally who has reached maximum medical improvement at our hospital and is ready to be discharged and whose home government
1307969 your honor this is a case about a hospital that has failed to do its job properly
1307970 why are you sad when you have basically everything that could be offered to you
1307971 as aquinas once stated the good is not the enemy of the perfect
1307972 we went to see him at the hospital and his bed was empty
1307973 that facility could have taken care of me any day
1307974 telling everyone that he was from miami florida and showing them his toy cat
1307975 that he would be staying with his new friends in guatemala and that i was leaving
1307976 its the same as the classic fall on the stairs right
1307977 you go to my home you fall on my stairs and then you sue me i am responsible
1307978 how could i possibly have given him what he needs
1307979 he was lying in the hallway on a stretcher covered in his own excrement
1307980 so we cleaned him up and we brought him home
1307981 its a letter that says listen dont take action to dump this individual because youll be risking legal action
1307982 should they win we would like them to take those damages and pay his hospital bill
1307983 they chose the wrong way to deal with it the right way would have been through the legislature there is no program in place to appropriately distribute care to undocumented persons who are catastrophically injured and there should be but you dont stick a brain injured immigrant on a private plane and spirit him out of the country in the predawn hours
1307984 the first striking thing was his disposition he was very very happy
1307985 then the second thing he was well cared for what i did was i got down over him and hugged him but also smelled and there were no bedsores nothing was malodorous
1307986 i said his quality of life is better than it would be in an american nursing home
1307987 but i hazarded a guess that his longevity of existence was probably severely curtailed
1307988 there was no real compelling reason to think of bringing him back to florida
1307989 we needed to focus on getting help to him or him to help in guatemala
1307990 for many years i am caring for him like he is a baby changing his diaper washing him but this is worse i am worried to leave him alone at all
1307991 the day my mother is no longer whats going to happen to me
1307992 i headed north like a peasant with a heavy bundle on his back bent over determined to better himself
1307993 other people had things so i thought why not me but now i regret it maybe god was punishing me for my illusions
1307994 thats the usual story of patients that are released from the national orthopedic hospital
1307995 in cases like that if you cut the medical care youre hurting that person
1307996 youre doing just the opposite of what the medical system should do that goes against every international convention of human rights and health to send him to guatemala was to send him to very poor living and health conditions and probably he will die because of that and thats not fair
1307997 it would be possible to set up a good health care arrangement for him because in private practice we have all types of specialties that he needs
1307998 i am sending you some little things luis i hope that you like them
1307999 that we miss you and love you a lot may god continue to bless you
1308000 then why are all the lights on and some people in there
1308001 that is just the cleaning crew honey they come in when the store closes and of course they need the lights on to see what they are doing
1308002 there it is the tooth fairy didnt forget you it must have fallen out of the bed when you got up to look for it under your pillows
1308003 what makes this data so disturbing is the clear and unexpected finding that dating abuse and violence begins at such a young age
1308004 the best way to do this is to mandate this in my estimation
1308005 were fighting for generations here and generations yet to come to end this scourge
1308006 teens have a right to know this and parents have a right to know as well
1308007 lindsay had a right to know this information too its too late to help lindsay

1308014 noch einmal komplett abschalten um danach f r die anstehenden aufgaben hoch motiviert zu sein
1308015 bis jetzt geht es gut die pferde gew hnen sich mehr und mehr an das wetter
1308016 es zahlt sich aus dass wir unseren pferden im vorfeld beigebracht haben aus eimern zu trinken so k nnen sie auch auf dem trainingsfeld wasser zu sich nehmen
1308017 es ist mir ein r tsel dass es ein komitee gibt das die spiele nach hongkong vergibt
1308018 bei diesen bedingungen k nnen die pferde die eigene k rpertemperatur nicht mehr regulieren sie m ssen vier wochen gek hlt werden

1308027 people should not touch it or attempt to pick it up by the tail as these snakes do bite said inspector dave coleman of kent police
1308028 we believe the snake will be looking for a damp dark and warm location and as it had been recently fed it will be fairly lethargic they are also excellent swimmers he said
1308029 we deden het in de avonduren in goed overleg met de werkgevers het is iets totaal anders het schaadt locatienet of keeno niet
1308030 dat is nog niet heel bijzonder maar daarnaast kan het dezelfde soort aanbevelingen ook genereren tussen bevriende websites van bijvoorbeeld bestaand blogrolls of tussen websites in een bepaald uitgeefnetwerk bijvoorbeeld van
1308031 we noemen dat product nu even elders je kunt openbaar netwerken vormen we bieden dan wel de mogelijkheid om bepaalde sites uit te sluiten bijvoorbeeld van concurrenten waarmee je niet wilt samenwerken
1308032 dit zijn de bekendste weblogs in de markt waarin ik actief ben online marketing ik ken de mensen ook persoonlijk en ze vinden het erg boeiend om hieraan mee te werken
1308033 dit is natuurlijk de perfecte dienst voor target advertising je schiet zo midden in de roos maar we denken niet dat gebruikers het zomaar accepteren als naast de aanbeveling steeds een willekeurige advertentie verschijnt
1308034 dat model volgt iedereen nu juist we willen dit juist niet op de bekende advertentiemodellen laten steunen omdat een aanbeveling makkelijk verward kan worden met ads als we niet uitkijken we hebben wat gedachten over een nieuw model wat we het komende jaar willen uitwerken
1308035 natuurlijk zul je pogingen zien en zal het wel weer een wedren worden met spammers maar veel kans maken ze niet
1308036 maar dat werkt met aanbevelingen voornamelijk op semantiek gebaseerd niet direct op interesses wat wij doen is voor zover mij bekend nog niet gedaan
1308037 deze technologie is wat ons betreft een flinke stap verder dan de bekende collaborative en rating achtige methoden
1308038 dat is wat je wilt op internet snel geleid worden naar de publicaties en producten war je echt op dat moment interesse in hebt
1308039 we will do everything possible to ensure the market is as vigorous as possible to ensure prices do go down mr bowen said
1308040 workably competitive but restricted by factors such as limited incentives for price competition between the major players coles and woolworths
1308041 we think economic factors and our customers shopping preferences should determine the location of our supermarkets not additional regulation that creates more red tape coles managing director ian mcleod said

1308043 were hoping we can get the business done today in time for him to play tonight
1308044 it would be a big signing he played for us in pre season but with his background at arsenal and qpr we didnt think it possible that he would come to us he moved on to our friends up the road st mirren for a trial but for whatever reasons that hasnt worked out
1308045 our reports on him have been very very good hopefully well have him in time to play tonight
1308046 allan trained on monday and he should be available ryan harding was on the bench on saturday and he too is available
1308047 we are keen to move on we looked at why we lost the goal not just what role the officials played
1308048 we can now use this cup tie as a platform for a very big game against st johnstone on saturday they are the front runners but a lot of teams have been making noises about what they are going to do
1308049 we are not making any bold brash statements we are confident as a group we know we have to improve our home form in particular and make cappielow the fortress it once was
1308050 the abc loan has been of great concern to qpr fans and has been a noose around the neck of this club for far too long
1308051 i am delighted that we have now made arrangements to put this saga to an end
1308052 building for the future is what is important to me and the rest of the qpr board however with certain issues it is always necessary to deal with elements from the past and today we have done this
1308053 this once again highlights our commitment to this football club and now i am looking forward to working on the continued growth of queens park rangers both as a club and as a brand

1308130 many digital content goods and services are becoming basic must haves particularly in the sub 35 age group devices like the iphone even in its 3g incarnation are undoubtedly contributing to consumer awareness and usage of mobile music services people who are 15 to 20 today will expect to buy directly with their phones and will drive this market over the next few years
1308131 even though typical transaction sizes will remain in the 3 5 bracket a sufficient number of users will be using their mobiles to buy music games tickets infotainment and the other digital goods sufficiently often to see gross transaction value grow nearly seven fold by 2013
1308132 for the second half of the year we expect sales in the third quarter to be more than the second quarter results but only moderately as both motorola and lg issued warnings for a sequential drop in sales as well as an economic environment that remains challenging
1308133 all the hopes for mobile phone manufacturers for the overall year end growth results rest on the final quarter of the year when most new products will be introduced to the market and the normal seasonality will help boost sales
1308134 with a more mature market mobile operators are seeing their service revenue come under pressure and driven by lower flat rate tariffs demand for data services is starting to pick up increasing demand for network investment

1308151 further measures in the autumn to help people with housing and through them the housing market
1308152 but a short term stamp duty holiday for all buyers will have far more positive impact on browns popularity than the housing market public finances could not sustain a full suspension for long and the market needs long term sustainable reform of the tax starting with redistribution upwards of the tax bands to really stimulate the bottom end of the market
1308153 the government now needs to take action quickly and decisively dithering over details will only hold up transactions even further as people delay purchase decisions to see if they could save on tax
1308154 with property prices falling by 15 in many areas already this year we have seen a renewed interest in first time buyers looking to purchase a property
1308155 the government must act now if speculation of the stamp duty break continues to rumble on then the current dire situation will become a lot worse the housing market is a fundamental component of the economy and its collapse will cripple the country

1308164 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1308165 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1308166 as it turns out big oils most successful speculating wasnt in the oil fields it was in washington where they invested millions in john mccain and got their moneys worth

1308178 when i first got military commissions one of my buddies picked slahi out and said this is probably the most significant guy at guantanamo but theyre doing special projects on him
1308179 i asked what special projects were and he said well we really dont know but it doesnt sound good
1308180 it was the only light in the room and i saw a detainee sitting in the corner of the room wearing orange
1308181 the detainee slahi had been shown a letter on state department letterhead that indicated his mother and brother had been picked up by force and his mother would be brought to guantanamo the letter was sort of stressing out loud concerns about what they were going to do because she was going to be the only female detainee at guantanamo they were concerned about her safety
1308182 by that point i had seen enough i had read enough i had heard enough and enough was enough
1308183 its a violation of our domestic law it is a violation of our values as americans and a violation of international norms and laws the debatable thing now is whether the cruel inhumane or degrading treatment of a particular detainee falls under the same category some of this stuff gets to the point where it really tears at the fabric of what we are as americans and our american values
1308184 well think about it tomorrow is an unconscionable conclusion for an agency whose mission is to protect the environment added hirshfield
1308185 we are aware of the stations safety violation with the failure of the back up diesel generator during testing and have met with cooper senior officials regarding their plans to address this
1308186 we are paying close attention to this situation and will continue to do so
1308187 uribe is brazenly trying to take the power to investigate congressmen away from the one institution that has done the most to uncover and break paramilitary influence in the congress
1308188 this proposal serves no real purpose other than to help members of uribes coalition get off the hook
1308189 certainly the congressmen are entitled to due process but this proposal is far from necessary to secure those rights
1308190 the governments orwellian invocation of due process here appears primarily designed to mask an effort to undermine the parapolitics investigations
1308191 separate within the supreme court itself the functions of investigation and trial
1308192 the fact is individual prosecutors or lower court judges with less protection experience and visibility are far less likely to push the investigations of the congressmen forward than the supreme court which has a proven track record in these cases

1308200 freshwater habs pose serious threats to human and ecological health this report assesses the state of knowledge about freshwater habs in the u s and sets research priorities to improve our ability to minimize or even prevent impacts of these events
1308201 the central importance of this report is that this is the first comprehensive look at harmful algal blooms in u s freshwaters
1308202 freshwater algal blooms are equally as important and problematic as those found in marine waters they can affect drinking water for the millions of people across the country who rely on surface fresh water supplies such as the great lakes

1308208 these are very tough contracts between uk sport and the individuals concerned well evaluate immediately after beijing what the success has been
1308209 the boa has made it very clear it is not setting any medal targets

1308212 i think the opposite to mourinho i dont need to win to be sure of what i do
1308213 i think that if i would have been the one to ask abramovich for lampard
1308214 the best thing for us is to forget about what others are doing
1308215 ranieri hes actually right i am very demanding with myself and i need to win to be sure of things for that reason i have won so many trophies in my career
1308216 he on the other hand has the mentality of one who does not need to win and at almost 70 years of age has won a supercup and another small cup he is too old to change his mentality
1308217 to me the most interesting part of the whole story is that weve documented the timing and the magnitude of a tremendous change in antarctic climate the transition marks a shift from warm temperate glaciers with patches of fringing tundra to todays cold polar glaciers set within in a barren polar desert
1308218 the contrast couldnt be more striking it is like comparing tierra del fuego today with the surface of mars and this transition took place over a geologically short interval of roughly 200 000 years
1308219 they are the first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the dry valleys since their discovery during the first scott expedition in 1902 1903
1308220 to be able to identify living species amongst the fossils is phenomenal to think that modern counterparts have survived 14 million years on earth without any significant changes in the details of their appearances is striking it must mean that these organisms are so well adapted to their habitats that in spite of repeated climate changes and isolation of populations for millions of years they have not become extinct but have survived
1308221 the fossil finds allow us to examine antarctica as it existed just prior to climate cooling at 13 9 million years ago it is a unique window into the past on land there are very few places on earth that contain sediment of this age and none are as well preserved as those found in the dry valleys
1308222 the sediments allow reconstructions of alpine glaciers tundra and lakes all in remarkable detail to study these deposits is akin to strolling across the dry valleys 14 1 million years ago
1308223 is the last hint of vegetation in the dry valleys
1308224 the fossil finds and dating of volcanic ash show that roughly 14
1308225 and its within these ancient lake beds that we found the fossils
1308226 lewis marchant and ashworth discovered the last bit of life on the antarctic continent it was hanging on by its fingernails just a few simple plants and bugs in a small pond everything else around them frozen over and then wham they went too and it must have happened quickly because these fossils are literally freeze dried when i visited the scientists in the field they showed me how the moss was still green and leafy
1308227 it is one of the most dramatic and long lasting changes that one can imagine
1308228 i dont know of any other place on earth where such an enduring change has been documented the fact that it is associated with the extinction of tundra plants and insects helps provide quantitative estimates for the magnitude of this change
1308229 other scientists had been to this area before but hadnt noticed anything unusual it took the trained eye of this team to make the discovery
1308230 ill try my best to win every match step by step i havent wished for a lot as i dont want to give myself too much pressure
1308231 i think the chinese athletes have more advantages because they are playing in china
1308232 but i like the venue there is no wind and the lighting is comfortable
1308233 when we had given the contracts for the two stadiums in lahore and rawalpindi the project was divided into two phases
1308234 the initial phase was aimed at having the grounds ready for champions trophy matches while the second phase was mostly for additional work that could be completed after the tournament
1308235 the first phase is almost complete while the next will be carried out before we host india for a full series
1308236 some air conditioning units will be fixed in the second phase at the stadium
1308237 we are not shifting the media box anywhere it will stay where it and has been refurbished
1308238 there was some issue over timings and who could make it from the delegation and who would be present here in pakistan
1308239 they will be here for a two day visit and will go through the three venues
1308240 the evidence and reports we received were pretty conclusive about the charges
1308241 a central clause of the players central contract has been violated so a ban for a certain number of matches is likely
1308242 for me it is a really important couple of weeks starting here at the olympics going on to the us open
1308243 i still have plenty of tournaments to do well in and i hope i can start here at the olympics and fulfill my dream to win gold
1308244 i usually always stay at hotels all year long at tournaments so i said you know this time ill try this way
1308245 but i have to say the village is beautiful very nice very well done here with the vegetation and everything so its nice to be able to be part of the team like that
1308246 im here a few days earlier than in previous olympics
1308247 for our purposes usually were there 2 3 days ahead but now 7 8 days so actually thats a lot of practice and i had a good flight in from the states which is a long trip but i feel fine
1308248 olympiacos is a challenge for me i know i will be here for two years
1308249 ive had two weeks of pre season training with liverpool and i believe i will be ready to do whatever i have to
1308250 olympiacos are a great team who challenge for every honour in greece and in the champions league
1308251 the team has some good players a well known coach and fanatical supporters which always inspires them
1308252 it is not true that i am about to leave anfield
1308253 i dont want to give away too much information because i noticed one or two teams in the boat park are trying build sails like ours
1308254 it will be interesting to see if they can pull it off because we have been working on this for a long time
1308255 its got to be below nine knots of wind to work
1308256 mitch is probably one of the heavier teams out in qingdao so i would not be that surprised to see him use it
1308257 he has played at the highest level for many years and is someone i feel could do a good job for us
1308258 hes got bags of experience and could come into the club and really help our younger players but we havent got that far down the line yet
1308259 we will sit down and have a chat and if there is something we can sort out then great if not we move on

1308272 the hydrogen fuel for the scorpion is derived from fracturing water molecules drawn from a small on board water tank which means the car doesnt need to store the volatile fuel nor rely on hydrogen fueling stations the on board hydrogen system was co developed with another company hydrorunner and works through electrolysis of water using power generated from the vehicles electrical system

1308282 i wouldnt predict gordons demise too quickly i think he is just in a period where circumstances have got the british people appropriately concerned about how to get from day to day week to week
1308283 the only advice i would give him is that he has got a big brain and a good heart he just needs to apply them both to working through these issues as best he can and trust the politics
1308284 just trust the people to at whatever time he stands for election to make a good judgment you get one of these jobs the best politics is to do the job
1308285 although how long that will take is still unclear but a deal is not far off not at all
1308286 i was bitten by a spider three weeks ago and ended up being rushed into emergency i couldnt walk on my foot for two days
1308287 it was the same leg it was the toxins and i had a really really bad fever that night
1308288 at first i thought i had sunstroke but i woke up in the night and couldnt stand on my foot at all and by the morning the foot was like a red balloon and there was a red line all the way up the inside of my leg
1308289 i have no doubt this campaign will give strength to many women
1308290 just playing the role has taken a huge emotional toll on my life but it is nothing compared to the pain fear and torment experienced by the thousands of women refuge supports every day
1308291 i have no doubt this campaign will give strength to many women who may be experiencing abuse now or who may do so in the future to reach out and get help
1308292 its all too easy for women to excuse their partners possessive and jealous behaviour but in so doing they run the risk of the abuse increasing in frequency and severity over time
1308293 by understanding the signs early a woman is forewarned and forearmed
1308294 when i was composing the music for the award ceremony i was thinking what makes a champion
1308295 this research reveals that high earning people are the same as the rest of the population tending to put themselves nearer the middle than they are
1308296 this is important for policymakers because it means high earners express many of the same concerns as the rest of the public
1308297 they have a sense that the uk is suffering because of widening income inequalities but they do not believe that altering the taxation system will have a real effect
1308298 it is a miracle for me because i was able to smile again laugh again and just feel alive again
1308299 i had to make sacrifices and i dream of the day some day when everyone can afford to clone their pet because losing a pet is a terrible terrible loss to anyone
1308300 as of today we are at the stage of receiving orders from anywhere in the world
1308301 the first quarter last year was the strongest quarter of the year nevertheless this is a disturbing sales performance from a strong market leader that we would expect to outperform the wider market
1308302 the trading environment in the uk has become more difficult and we can see this continuing for the rest of our financial year
1308303 however we believe that our recent operational improvements enhance our resilience to challenging market conditions and that our strong competitive position will enable the business to continue to grow market share
1308304 of course of course ill keep going imagine if i gave up now

1308370 i spilled something on my dress i didnt want it to stain so i stuck my dress under the sink and was running out the door

1308372 i bring her with me everywhere its nice to have another heartbeat shes a little piece of home
1308373 blake is a young actor but very thorough i can see why shes on the rise
1308374 blake was such a big advocate of the sisterhood she loved bridget when she feels something is right she follows her heart no matter what shes fearless and down to earth
1308375 goes across the world i was moving from los angeles to new york literally at the same time i was shooting this movie
1308376 i was moving away and starting out on my own and i have these girls people i work with people on the show that are really close
1308377 i never read those stories the only thing that made any of us nervous was the fact that we had a six week prep
1308378 it happened so fast we were nervous because we didnt have a script at the beginning we were all so happy to be together we loved the first movie so much we wanted to do a sequel there was never any hesitation about that
1308379 yeah i dont really like to talk about anything but the show
1308380 its two separate things you dont date a character im nothing like serena
1308381 put it this way it hasnt happened in the year and a half since ive been here
1308382 it seemed ironic to me because i thought the fake boot camp was nothing like a real boot camp
1308383 its about 10 times harder you guys from experience i can tell you firsthand
1308384 the idea for this movie is what happens when a bunch of actors get stuck out in the jungle in a real world situation because us actors most of us are what wussies
1308385 this is the future this is like the apex of the vortex of joint technology this is what your grandchildren are going to be smoking
1308386 a kid who tells on another kid is a dead kid
1308387 the rogen has been pumping out the hits recently and i found them funny and relevant to my age
1308388 i dont know why someone would make such a long run out of the same exact movies
1308389 what i appreciate about tropic thunder is that it is ben stiller in spoof mode
1308390 im bored of him as a victim of circumstances who mugs his way through humiliation after humiliation
1308391 pineapple express is up there with the big lebowski and sean penn in fast times at ridgemont high
1308392 good stoner fun its superbad seven years older with the same friendship idea you get the feeling these men will not grow up ever
1308393 its ben stiller at his smartest laughing at hollywood and himself with cruise dropped in the middle with his peak performance
1308394 the hard r is directed at teenage boys of all ages
1308395 it says this isnt going to be safe they push it to the limit
1308396 it opened up the door for films to again tackle political issues
1308397 when hollywood dealt with war directly last fall it alienated audiences
1308398 now comedies are starting to deal with national concerns outside of family and romance like sandlers
1308399 if you make people laugh and think they like it you can be smart about being stupid people will let you get away with more
1308400 they went to juno over knocked up they are looking for novelty
1308401 comedy used to be more about characters who were fish out of water or just weird
1308402 now they are dealing with the reality at hand being more true to the situation
1308403 it was a time when all actors were going away to fake boot camp and talking about these incredible experiences that they had and how it really changed their lives there was something there that seemed funny to me
1308404 we should then at least have fun with it since were going to have to be an r
1308405 i was watching true romance on laser disc thats how long ago it was
1308406 i always thought brad pitt was hilarious playing a crackhead and wished the guys were chasing him instead i thought about potheads who think it is harmless to smoke it and it would be funny if leaders of a pot cartel were as murderous as coke dealers
1308407 its fun to see a cheech and chong film with jerry bruckheimer action
1308408 based on what were seeing on our message boards and all over the web the buzz on both of these titles is really high
1308409 its going to be that end of summer last hurrah for moviegoers many will see pineapple express which will probably be no 1 that weekend and then turn around and see tropic thunder the next a one two punch

1308431 this was not an easy decision and it was arrived at only after a great deal of thought and a thorough analysis of possible alternatives
1308432 i see this just as something thats been fizzling slowly over the last 10 or 15 years and now its rapidly on its way out the door
1308433 montanas pretty remote to get to to begin with so it makes it a little more difficult especially for our west coast guests specifically to get to butte

1308445 the majority of english bishops believe that it has been a good conference there has been real listening and real hearing
1308446 there are no instant solutions to the big difficulties but there is a commitment to stay together and work on it
1308447 the lambeth conference is required to do something rather than live down to the worst expectations of the bishops who stayed away
1308448 we need to negotiate a separation in the communion sooner rather than later to leave the strongest possibility of remaining in some kind of fellowship
1308449 the most unhealthy thing would be to allow the debate to continue for a long time

1308461 a number of commercial firms compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software to end users at nominal cost and earning revenue on complementary services and products
1308462 these firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the software some of these firms may build upon microsoft ideas that we provide to them free or at low royalties in connection with our interoperability initiatives
1308463 to the extent open source software gains increasing market acceptance our sales revenue and operating margins may decline

1308480 as i wrote before i found your paper to have some good ideas for how nonprofits could use squidoo perhaps some innovative soul will create a squidoo lens on that very topic
1308481 whether any or all of these strategies are right for your organization depends on your marketing goals and other communications strategies in play
1308482 uses for outreach and community building flickr is a new way for organizations to tell their story with a flickr account individuals can showcase and chronicle their organizations work through their own photography for example by creating a group photo pool and encouraging discussions flickr members can build awareness of an organizations work members can also provide a link to their organizations web site in their flickr profiles conversely the organizations web site can stream flickr photos uses within organizations flickr members can store all their photographs of their organizations work in one place if they have the legal right to do so account holders can upload photos to flickr from anywhere in the world the photos can be organized into sets and collections and they can be tagged for easy searching another tool that organizations can use internally is a flickr group in a private group only group members and those who have been invited can view the group page groups can also be completely public or public by invitation only
1308483 a squidoo page contains links links to products for sale to reviews to pictures to videos to rss feeds and to blogs
1308484 users tend to glance at websites when they need to accomplish something or to find the answer to a specific question in contrast newsletters feel personal because they arrive in users inboxes and users have an ongoing relationship with them newsletters also have a social aspect as users often forward them to colleagues and friends
1308485 feeds are a cold medium in comparison with email newsletters feeds dont form the same relationship between company and customers that a good newsletter can build we dont have data to calculate the relative business value of a newsletter subscriber compared to a feeds subscriber but we wouldnt be surprised if it turns out that companies make ten times as much money from each newsletter subscriber given that newsletters are a warmer and much more powerful medium it is probably best for most companies to encourage newsletter subscriptions and promote them over feeds on their website
1308486 contains useful information and i recommend it if your nonprofit has a blog or is considering one
1308487 a good blog is one where posts are fresh and new posts are frequent
1308488 one respondent says dont start a blog unless you have people in your organization to post to it daily in an open friendly and excited tone
1308489 it is important not to be afraid of giving up the mono directed control that usually characterizes an organization
1308490 blogs are not a fad they are no longer even an option those businesses that choose to remain outside this online conversation will be sidelined eventually they will become extinct
1308491 and dont buy that nonsense about needing to have conversations with the marketplace thats an ideology not a strategy
1308492 the effect of business blogs on customer or stakeholder behavior

1308499 we are delighted to have both alan and mark on board with ireland
1308500 both of them are extremely strong technical coaches in their areas and i think they will bring a further positive mix to the coaching team and squad
1308501 alan brings with him experience of both international and most importantly irish rugby
1308502 mark is recognised as one of the top kicking coaches in the world and his experience of working with the squad in the past will help with the transition over the next number of weeks

1308507 i dont know what happened i think a wave hit us all of a sudden she was gone i thought she was dead
1308508 every time i had a chance to get up to the surface i took a breath and then was dunked down again
1308509 when i finally saw them they were being battered up against the breakwater
1308510 i told them we were going to get them out
1308511 were both very shaken and were ecstatic to be alive
1308512 for us it was nothing short of a miracle we would definitely be dead right now if they hadnt come
1308513 he is paid at a level that equates to people with a masters degree in that position
1308514 thats not a crime its the use of it thats a crime and the use is generally a false statement to an employer
1308515 i know some of them did receive extra compensation and extra stipend in their pay
1308516 i dont think any of them used them for promotions the contract allowed for an increased stipend if you had a bachelors degree an increased stipend if you had a masters degree

1308547 for the second half of the year we expect sales in the third quarter to be more than the second quarter results but only moderately as both motorola and lg issued warnings for a sequential drop in sales as well as an economic environment that remains challenging

1308549 with a more mature market mobile operators are seeing their service revenue come under pressure and driven by lower flat rate tariffs demand for data services is starting to pick up increasing demand for network investment

1308562 now is the time for a real debate on the future of public sector sports broadcasting which i know is under consideration and under review
1308563 all these people interested in cricket buy tv licences and surely they should have a right to expect that the public sector broadcasters mount bids for the nations summer sport as they do in the case of one of them for 12 other sports
1308564 after all just how many people play formula one if the bbc is to remain part of this it must answer to the millions of cricket fans in england and wales how it prioritises its investment in sports rights
1308565 i think its a question for cricket fans to ask the bbc
1308566 we have spent a great deal of time on this since the last television rights we took account of the views of the select committee that we should speak to all the broadcasters which we did
1308567 there have been a lot of statements made by public sector broadcasters on what they were going to do it is matter for them what in the end they determined not to do
1308568 they make investments in 12 other sports but whether those sports attract the same level of participation i dont know
1308569 were talking 3 5million people which is quite a large number of the population the cricket club is increasingly the centre of a great deal of community life both in villages and in suburbs of our towns
1308570 the bbc is astonished by the comments by the ecb
1308571 weve always said any bid for live test cricket was subject to value for money and fitting into scheduling and in our view neither of these criteria were met
1308572 we have consistently argued that not having cricket as a listed event puts it out of the reach of all terrestrial broadcasters
1308573 thats the ecbs choice and they are entitled to it but its absurd to blame the bbc for this outcome

1308578 until there is a cure prevention is the only way to deal with not getting aids and also too it is important that when you are infected that you still work with prevention and the best way to do that is with a condom

1309109 if john coates believes its possible then i think we can make a very serious play for this
1309110 inequities in access to health care and huge disparities in health outcomes
1309111 the divide between rich and poor is rising at a troubling rate within subregions of asia pacific leaving vast numbers of mothers and children at risk
1309112 it is not just bigger health budgets we could make a big difference by focussing on the three or four states in north india where most of these children die governments need to tackle female discrimination in the region too half the child deaths recorded in pakistan india and afghanistan occurred in the first month of the babys life
1309113 india could learn from chinas experience in two big ways
1309114 one is getting health services out to the villages china was successful in what was called barefoot doctors the other is female education educated women making educated choices has a big impact on the survival of their children

1309118 if you see him and you know him or if youve ever had any dealings with him if you could give the sheriffs warrants squad a call we would appreciate it
1309119 the government run by prime minister gordon brown is sheltering lawbreakers who promote terrorism in bahrain it is strange that people who are convicted of crimes are granted asylum and financial support in britain
1309120 how would british people feel if bahrain starts granting asylum to members of the irish republican army they should understand that these political groups incite hatred against our country which also violates the u k laws
1309121 there is an independent body in the uk responsible for asylum policy and not the government but with the same token the bahrain government should also study why some people left the country and refused to return

1309123 the currencies of economies with large current account deficits should depreciate relative to those countries with surpluses this will stimulate their exports and curb imports thereby helping to slim the trade gap
1309124 each nation has been made to look with an invidious eye upon the prosperity of the nations which it trades and to consider their gain its loss a nation may import to a greater value than it exports for half a century even the debts too which it contracts in the principle nation with whom it deals may be gradually increasing and yet its real wealth the exchangeable value of the annual produce of its land and labor may during the same period have been increasing in much greater proportion
1309125 there is much experience to suggest that the most effective way to convert a market economy into an authoritarian economic society is to start imposing direct controls on foreign exchange thesis borrowed from economics nobel laurite f a hayek in to suggest that restrictions on transactions in foreign exchange may be necessary as a cure this cure would be vastly worse than the disease
1309126 full fledged exchange controls and so called inconvertibility of currencies were invented by hjalmar schacht in the early years of the nazi regime

1309159 la mayor a de las demoliciones son de edificios de varias plantas que son el hogar de varias familias lo que significa que mucho m s de 100 000 familias palestinas pueden haberse quedado sin hogar debido a las pol ticas administrativas israel es

1309216 the market consensus is expecting the fed to keep rates on hold but the accompanying statement might move markets
1309217 our sense is that at some point china is likely to put its foot back on the accelerator
1309218 probably to about 100 within the next month if you keep on getting weak demand data
1309219 it seems that the market is losing interest in geopolitical and weather induced props and instead is becoming more aware of growing supply demand imbalances
1309220 the immediate preoccupation for the dollar will be the feds rate announcement tonight
1309221 with interest rates widely expected to be held unchanged the focus will fall on the accompanying statement
1309222 despite the generally better than expected run of us data lately we think the fed will be reluctant to repeat its view from the last statement that the downside risks to growth have diminished for fear of fostering premature expectations of a future interest rate hike
1309223 overall we expect a neutral tone to the statement consistent with the feds keeping rates unchanged over the next few meetings

1309261 in 1998 the united states also changed its underlying policy toward iraq from containment to regime change and began to examine options to effect such a change including support for iraqi opposition leaders within the country and abroad in the 4 years since the inspectors intelligence reports show that saddam hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock his missile delivery capability and his nuclear program he has also given aid comfort and sanctuary to terrorists including al qaida members though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of september 11 2001
1309262 it is clear however that if left unchecked saddam hussein wiill continue to increase his capability to wage biological and chemical warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons should he succeed in that endeavor he could alter the political and security landscape of the middle east which as we know all too well affects american security
1309263 i agree completely with this administrations goal of a regime change in iraq saddam hussein is a renegade and outlaw who turned his back on the tough conditions of his surrender put in place by the united nations in 1991
1309264 i believe the record of saddam husseins ruthless reckless breach of international values and standards of behavior is cause enough for the world community to hold him accountable by use of force if necessary
1309265 we have known for many years that saddam hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction
1309266 we know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country
1309267 when i vote to give the president of the united states the authority to use force if necessary to disarm saddam hussein it is because i believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a threat and a grave threat to our security and that of our allies in the persian gulf region i will vote yes because i believe it is the best way to hold saddam hussein accountable
1309268 with respect to saddam hussein and the threat he presents we must ask ourselves a simple question
1309269 the joint chiefs should provide congress with casualty estimates for a war in iraq as they have done in advance of every past conflict these estimates should consider saddams possible use of chemical or biological weapons against our troops unlike the gulf war many experts believe saddam would resort to chemical and biological weapons against our troops in a desperate attempt to save his regime if he believes he and his regime are ultimately threatened
1309270 i would disagree with john mccain that its the actual weapons of mass destruction he may use against us its what he may do in another invasion of kuwait or in a miscalculation about the kurds or a miscalculation about iran or particularly israel those are the things that that i think present the greatest danger he may even miscalculate and slide these weapons off to terrorist groups to invite them to be a surrogate to use them against the united states its the miscalculation that poses the greatest threat
1309271 if you dont believe saddam hussein is a threat with nuclear weapons then you shouldnt vote for me
1309272 saddam husseins regime represents a grave threat to america and our allies including our vital ally israel for more than two decades saddam hussein has sought weapons of mass destruction through every available means we know that he has chemical and biological weapons he has already used them against his neighbors and his own people and is trying to build more we know that he is doing everything he can to build nuclear weapons and we know that each day he gets closer to achieving that goal
1309273 there is no doubt that since that time saddam hussein has invigorated his weapons programs reports indicate that biological chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre gulf war status in addition saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer range missiles that will threaten the united states and our allies
1309274 we should be hell bent on getting those weapons of mass destruction hell bent on having a credible approach to them but we should try to do it in a way which keeps the world together and that achieves our goal which is removing the defanging saddam
1309275 we know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country
1309276 iraqs search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as saddam is in power
1309277 we have known for many years that saddam hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction
1309278 the last un weapons inspectors left iraq in october of 1998 we are confident that saddam hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons
1309279 when i vote to give the president of the united states the authority to use force if necessary to disarm saddam hussein it is because i believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a threat and a grave threat to our security and that of our allies in the persian gulf region i will vote yes because i believe it is the best way to hold saddam hussein accountable
1309280 there is unmistakable evidence that saddam hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years
1309281 he has systematically violated over the course of the past 11 years every significant un resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons and any nuclear capacity this he has refused to do

1309290 if we get evidence we will certainly get to the bottom of this do not forget we have been victims of terrorism also it is in our own interest to get to the bottom of this
1309291 that of isi involvement has been sort of denied by pakistan and with good authority there is no truth in that there is no pakistani agency that is involved that is being referred to
1309292 we would like to see why such accusations are made
1309293 between the two prime ministers and foreign ministers there is a desire to carry the dialogue process forward we want to get going on various issues which are pending on both sides
1309294 we have every intention to respect it and no intention to violate it
1309295 after the last meeting in colombo i think the record has been set straight there is a desire between the two countries to carry the process forward

1309325 you could get a lot of strength from a person like frank who had suffered all the discrimination that a black man goes through in america
1309326 frank was part of a group of black vanguard intellectuals
1309327 mccarthy era strategy of smear tactics and condemnation by association
1309328 struggled to find mentors in his search for a black identity
1309329 he made his vision into a beacon a light shedding understanding and enlightenment on the problems that denied people regardless of race national origin or economic status their constitutional rights

1309332 growing up as a young man of mixed race barack obama benefited from the spirit of tolerance that defined hawaiis racial climate
1309333 it all depends on what the the meaning of is is
1309334 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
1309335 obviously he odinga believes that the votes were not tallied properly
1309336 but what i urged was that all the leaders there regardless of their position on the election tell their supporters to stand down to desist with the violence and resolve it in a peaceful way with kenyan laws

1309352 my target is to get involved in the business of the team less and less often i dont want to get into that i believe that with csaba laszlo in charge this dream of not having to do things with the team can continue so far it has been smooth sailing there has been no problem whatsoever working with csaba laszlo is good he is professional and has achieved a lot already hopefully he will stand the ideological pressing of those around football
1309353 csaba laszlo has plenty of experience working in the football world that allows him to work with me and convince me with a lot of positions where the manager wants to do it his way he can convince me of that and i can take that on board

1309366 the aleutian islands are home to natural resources found nowhere else in the world and the regional economy is dominated by commercial fishing
1309367 protection of the regions natural resources is therefore a paramount public concern
1309368 was meinen tipp die f lle auf dem teig fl chig zu verteilen betrifft da bei diesem die f lle meist sehr ppig aufgelegt wird empfiehlt es sich erstens den teig eine spur dicker zu lassen damit er beim einrollen nicht rei t und zweitens den strudel in einer auflaufform oder bratenreine zu backen damit er nicht auseinanderl uft die form selber muss gro z gig mit butter eingefettet werden und auch der strudel sollte vor dem backen und auch zwischendurch beim backen mit reichlich zerlassener butter eingepinselt werden bei dieser zubereitungsart ergibt sich dass die unterseite des strudels durch den von der f lle durchfeuchteten teig in verbindung mit der ppig verwendeten butter karamelisiert und dadurch extrem aromatisch und knusprig wird

1309399 there comes a time in your life when you have to get rid of scaly mates let me tell you
1309400 trust is something thats built up over a long period of time and can be destroyed in a millisecond
1309401 unfortunately because of that equation of how quickly it is destroyed and how long it takes to build up therell be a period of time where those boys will have to establish themselves
1309402 what it does crystalise is that in football theres a ripple effect for everything that happens
1309403 in north melbournes case theres been a financial effect on the club if these players dont perform well both on and off the field
1309404 when you see what happens at any club a players impact on the sponsors on the club on the supporters on the media is far reaching
1309405 so if anything we hope our players learn from what happens and see the consequences of their actions and how they can impact upon the club
1309406 this case in my mind illustrates the need for the afl to consider when they do their review of the rules at the end of the year introducing a specific offence for contact of this nature
1309407 this has been done with respect to front on contact and with respect to head high contact and in my view that was very appropriate
1309408 there is a need for a specific offence that takes into account a dangerous tackle or a throw tackle or as it is called in rugby league a spear tackle but that is a matter for the afl

1309467 as i started seeing all the media on barack obama i started realising that john mccain didnt have that rally song or fight song something that can get everybody together to fight so i took it upon myself to try to write the theme song for his campaign
1309468 john mccain has been a prisoner of war and a true american hero hes been through pains and injuries and has the scars to prove it so i thought ive got to write a song that reflects that and shows how this guy is a steel rod of a patriot how hes unbendable and has always put his country before himself
1309469 the maverick spirit of the song sells particularly well to all americans even obama supporters
1309470 if i can make them understand about where john mccain has come from and the journey hes been on theres no way they cannot respect him for that
1309471 the more you get to know john mccain the more you respect the fact that hes both a patriot and an independent thinker a rebel when it means staying true to what he believes in hopefully my song will help those people out there who are starting to pay attention to him to realise what kind of guy he is

1309522 b lgica es un estado federal que se compone de comunidades y regiones
1309523 si no hay nuevas transferencias de competencias a las regiones mi partido no participar en un gobierno tras las elecciones de 2007 la necesidad de tener un gobierno federal pasa a segundo plano frente a los intereses de flandes aqu la gente lleva siglos viviendo sin ser belga
1309524 cada fase de la reforma del estado est pre ada de la reforma siguiente presente en ella de forma embrionaria
1309525 todas las estructuras federales est n en continua evoluci n
1309526 tenemos que inventar nuevas formas de vivir juntos en nuestro pa s
1309527 no se puede conseguir de golpe hay que ir paso a paso
1309528 forma parte de esa nueva generaci n de pol ticos flamencos que comenzaron su carrera pol tica tras la reforma de 1993
1309529 estamos en el coraz n de europa y me parece inconcebible impensable que b lgica se separe estoy preocupado siempre se pueden encontrar soluciones pero me preocupa que no haya respeto y confianza entre las personas
1309530 la verdad es que en este pa s faltan dos o tres personas que est n intelectual y pol ticamente a la altura del desaf o
1309531 hay dificultad para encontrar alguien con una palabra fiable y cre ble en el cd amp v
1309532 no se sabe muy bien qui n lleva la voz cantante se logra un acuerdo con alguien y al poco le desautorizan
1309533 no hay que olvidar que b lgica naci como una accidente de la historia
1309534 b lgica es un estado federal que se compone de comunidades y regiones
1309535 por primera vez los puntos de vista son muy diferentes sobre el paisaje institucional a crear
1309536 hablar de dos naciones una flamenca y una franc fona es inexacto hay una naci n belga y una naci n flamenca
1309537 no me parece nada bien lo de la divisi n del pa s
1309538 en b lgica no hay partidos nacionales as que los que hay s lo est n interesados en la ampliaci n de las atribuciones para las comunidades y regiones nos dicen que hay que separarse pero s lo el 9 de lo flamencos lo quiere
1309539 cada firma ser una piedra que reforzar los puentes entre ambas comunidades
1309540 nos vemos como el ltimo reducto de resistencia por b lgica
1309541 hablar de escisi n es lo pol ticamente correcto pero no est en l nea con lo que la gente quiere
1309542 y como es m s f cil decir y hacer eso que crear crecimiento econ mico eso es lo que hay
1309543 cuando una se casa con el otro se aprende mucho
1309544 yo ten a una imagen muy simple de los franc fonos y ahora s que la situaci n es m s complicada y sutil de lo que se dice en flandes ahora conozco sus sensibilidades en flandes se dice que lo bloquean todo que son unos incapaces que hay que librarse de ellos que bruselas era flamenca y que los franc fonos se apoderaron de ella y que hay que recuperarla y reflamenquizarla
1309545 yo he aprendido la historia de los flamencos desconoc a que tuvieran tan v vida la idea de la opresi n pero yo no soy responsable de eso los flamencos neerland fonos fueron oprimidos por flamencos franc fonos tambi n he descubierto su cultura
1309546 los franc fonos son m s defensores de la libertad individual y que los neerland fonos defienden m s la cultura
1309547 apareci el director y nos dijo no hay flamencos en esta mesa nosotros ni lo hab amos notado nos sentamos juntos por afinidad yo creo que el director ten a miedo de que se fuera crear una divisi n interna que se reprodujera en la empresa lo que pasa en el pa s
1309548 por qu elegimos una soluci n de extrema derecha por qu los extremistas se fueron con hitler porque nosotros solos no ten amos fuerza para separarnos
1309549 en busca de una explicaci n a las tensiones pol ticas
1309550 aqu tratan de hacernos creer que los flamencos tenemos una identidad completamente diferente pero es mentira
1309551 no me entienda o haga como que no me entiende
1309552 desprecian al neerland s que consideran una lengua peque a
1309553 sobre esa cesi n territorial es imposible que haya acuerdo lo tendr an que tomar por la fuerza
1309554 no quiero la divisi n de b lgica quiero que siga unida pero que se invierta bien el dinero y que los valones trabajen y respeten a los flamencos
1309555 nosotros no vamos a dividir a b lgica s lo queremos una confederaci n nada m s
1309556 estamos orgullosos de que todas las reformas se hagan por v a pac fica lo que ocurre es que al cabo de un tiempo se descubren nuevos desequilibrios y se hacen necesarias nuevas reformas
1309557 el cd amp v no est por la independencia de flandes pero va en la direcci n de la independencia su evoluci n es hacia la independencia
1309558 no lo podr a decir a veces se va muy deprisa y a veces se frena el proceso ahora se va deprisa
1309559 es verdad que la construcci n de europa refuerza los regionalismos
1309560 pero la uni n necesita estados para funcionar a la comisi n le inquieta la hipot tica desaparici n de b lgica nadie quiere abrir la caja de pandora tras los flamencos y los valones vendr n los vascos los catalanes los escoceses los corsos
1309561 no se har nada por alentar el desmembramiento de un pa s de la uni n
1309562 no hay apoyo popular a ning n tipo de divisi n del pa s
1309563 no hay voluntad pol tica secesionista en las lites de flandes

1309579 what is happening in south east asia is terrifying to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1309580 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1309581 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1309582 the pressures on them have increased with the big push towards growing monoculture crops in part for their use as biofuels the growing of palm oil crops in south east asia and soya beans in the amazon have taken their toll
1309583 but hunting of primates for bushmeat has also increased this was a subsistence issue but now its almost become a luxury food with a higher price than for chicken or fish both in african and in south east asia

1309586 following some well informed press speculation in this mornings independent michael page has confirmed it has received an unsolicited preliminary approach from adecco the swiss recruitment company regarding a possible offer for the group although the two companies have been linked in the past investors should be aware that they operate different business models in difference sectors of the market michael page is more focused on white collar recruitment whilst adecco targets the blue collar market
1309587 adecco may believe that it had a once in a cycle opportunity to acquire mpi whilst a bid premium of up to 42 per cent may be attractive to some other michael page investors may be unwilling to sell out at a depressed valuation when the shares were trading at 600p a year ago

1309590 once the works are complete customers will get a new upgraded station with step free access increased capacity and better interchange facilities between the tube and national rail services
1309591 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1309592 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1309593 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1309594 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1309595 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1309596 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world

1309600 not in fashion but in architecture if you are lucky enough to know the greatest living architect and to have her accept an invitation to do a project it is magical this all began with a small sketch a computer drawing a concept i gave zaha the general idea in a few moments and her interpretation and fulfilment of that idea is more than perfect
1309601 the fascination of the project was the challenge of translating the intellectual and physical into the sensual experimenting with completely unexpected spaces and a totally immersive environment

1309603 it is a miracle for me because i was able to smile again laugh again and just feel alive again
1309604 i had to make sacrifices and i dream of the day some day when everyone can afford to clone their pet because losing a pet is a terrible terrible loss to anyone
1309605 as of today we are at the stage of receiving orders from anywhere in the world
1309606 what is happening in south east asia is terrifying to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1309607 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1309608 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1309609 the pressures on them have increased with the big push towards growing monoculture crops in part for their use as biofuels the growing of palm oil crops in south east asia and soya beans in the amazon have taken their toll
1309610 but hunting of primates for bushmeat has also increased this was a subsistence issue but now its almost become a luxury food with a higher price than for chicken or fish both in african and in south east asia
1309611 they are believed to have looked at michael page before and there is strategic sense to a deal
1309612 the key obstacle for adecco would be convincing michael page that the two companies can work together michael page is a professional recruitment consultant they focus on recruiting lawyers accountants etc but adecco is focused on more general blue collar recruitment
1309613 we expect the uk leisure travel market to prove particularly tough in 2009 despite the self help capacity cuts being seen across the sector
1309614 it is not inconceivable that ongc and sinopec team up to avoid competing against each other
1309615 the probability of a deal now exceeds 50 per cent
1309616 given that we believe the double digit declines in ad revs are now priced in that the risks surrounding pension funding have been mitigated and management is tackling costs we believe that there is little near term downside in the stock
1309617 the games industry does not appear to have been affected by the consumer slowdown in the uk implying some counter cyclical qualities to the game groups business model
1309618 no no not at all i was just concern thats all
1309619 theres no need i was just doing what is right
1309620 he told me how you wish to bring me back to repent for coming to my kingdom i just want to apologize for how my people have treated you
1309621 i just wish i could change the way my people see things in life and the way they treat others to show them that were all the same
1309622 please dont apologize for others its not fair for you to put the weight of others upon yourself and either way im used to it
1309623 at least you have your village a place where you can be safe from harm where you have the warmth of others who care for you
1309624 im the only brown echidna in the entire world i stand out everywhere and i fit in nowhere i have no place in society neither yours nor mine
1309625 rudolph why is it that you threw yourself in harms way for me
1309626 you really should try to at least get some sleep i dont want you to be tired for our journey tomorrow
1309627 so this is where my dad goes i always wondered why he always tells me to never come with him
1309628 the people here seem friendly not like my people i dont know why dad told me to stay away from this place

1309633 is it ok if rudolph and i go over to the flower fields
1309634 i should get home before my mother begins to worry about me
1309635 yeah i give you my word as an echidna that ill come and find you again

1309638 i am a lazy man a lazy man with a large collection of tv series on dvd its always annoyed me that ive had to pull the dvd box off the shelf pull apart several layers of packaging find out which disc has the episode i want to watch on it and then put that disc in my dvd player surely there must be an easier way of watching video in the digital age with this in mind ive investigating ways in which i can create a digital video jukebox for my dvds after a bit of research i narrowed it down to four choices

1309642 when frankie was born i started to learn about vaccine safety
1309643 the more i learned the more i realized how much misinformation there is about vaccines
1309644 we dont want it to be a fight between jenny mccarthy and amanda peet
1309645 many of our friends in hollywood were choosing not to vaccinate their babies or to delay vaccines because they feared that they might cause autism or other disorders
1309646 we had never thought about not vaccinating but when we went online to educate ourselves on vaccines we found web site after web site warning us about their dangers naturally we were very concerned about what we read
1309647 in 2007 the total area under coca cultivation in colombia was estimated at 99 000 hectares this estimate represented a 27 per cent increase in area under the illicit crop compared to 2006 78 000 ha
1309648 this is the first significant increase in coca cultivation after four years of relatively stable cultivation
1309649 with the hope that everyone can give their best in a genuine olympic spirit

1309654 more than three in five drivers are turning to public transport due to high fuel prices a survey has revealed the survey by transport firm national express found 61 per cent of car users are definitely or probably considering using public transport due to the rise in prices at the pumps
1309655 the movie is about a little girl who goes to the national pop warner event the first ever and plays the quarterback position its called longshots she and her uncle ice cube theyre taking a long shot as a team
1309656 the amazing part to me is its a true story and that this really happened
1309657 it happened around 2000 the girl is 15 now it happened it in harvey illinois and the funny thing is that harvey is not too far from where i grew up
1309658 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1309659 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point its focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand
1309660 but some of the issues that caused oil prices to lift have not yet been resolved
1309661 the warmer seas and drier climate caused by global warming work to the jellyfishs advantage since nearly all jellyfish breed better and faster in warmer waters
1309662 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
1309663 obama had to shift ground in order to explain a voting record more centrist on the iraq war than the words of his unrecorded but highly touted antiwar speech would suggest
1309664 mccains strength involves policy issues especially with a general electorate that in the united states is still today more center right politically than it is far left
1309665 mccain should advocate continuing the bush tax cuts and exploring private enterprise solutions to our nations health needs
1309666 repeat the reliable republican objections that universal health care would be another bottomless democratic pit nothing more than a social welfare giveaway that would destroy the private health care system
1309667 in our analysis of obamas experience as a chicago community organizer trained in saul alinskys radical socialist methodologies we warned change a slogan first introduced by alinsky was nothing more than a code word for the typical income redistribution those on the left have sought since the days of karl marx here in obamas proposal for increasing the capital gains tax we find proof fo the point
1309668 obama like dukakis is vulnerable to negative information about his past that can burst any cult of personality bubble that public relations experts such as axelrod can try to create around a political persona
1309669 because we do not demonstrate moral leadership other nations have no choice but to proliferate nuclear weapons at the base of the argument obama is saying a world with nuclear weapons is our fault
1309670 wall street investment firms and u s law firms representing multinational u s corporations in their global operations lead the list of obama bundling contributors
1309671 a person who has to hide his or her smoking appears to be living in a lie moreover new age guys do not smoke new age guys who smoke out of sight cannot be trusted a new age politician dreaming of change and hoping for the future is not an image consistent with a guy who has to smoke cigarettes on campaign breaks just to make it through the day maybe thats the way obama takes such care to maintain the pretense he is a nonsmoker the smoker image conflicts with the campaign personality axelrod is trying to craft so much so that obama hid the habit from a reporter who had become like a friend to him if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
1309672 obamas secret smoking may not be a trivial issue after all looked at from a certain perspective the habit is a crack in the wall a flaw that calls into question whether the persona axelrod has crafted for obama is who obama really is or simply the person axelrod wants us to see
1309673 defeating obama will require removing the mask axelrod has placed before obamas face so that important segments of the electorate can fully appreciate how radical and politically unacceptable to them his policy views truly are
1309674 michelle might have been raised by a middle class black working family on chicagos south side but while being educated at an ivy league school she indulged in the luxury of experiencing alienation instead of being grateful for the opportunity nor was the impression diminished when the public learned that michelle like barack also got her law degree at harvard in 1988
1309675 after the long talks we held it was clear for us that what happened on july 22 was a big conspiracy and very dangerous for the democratic and constitutional process of iraq in particular against the kurds
1309676 kurds are for the distribution of authority in kirkuk but not equally dividing it
1309677 they could not predict that in the resort they chose they could place the life of any of their children in danger
1309678 this includes the most dramatic thing ascertaining whether she is still alive or dead which seems the most probable
1309679 the investigators are fully conscious their work is not exempt from imperfections they worked with an enormous margin of error and achieved very little in terms of conclusive results especially about the fate of the unfortunate child
1309680 this is not unfortunately a detective novel a crime scenario fit for the investigative efforts of a sherlock holmes or hercule poirot guided by the illusion that the forces of law and justice can always re establish order
1309681 you have to ask what the police were trying to achieve by over presenting evidence that they did not have and clearly could not claim to have
1309682 we came up with the idea after we got out of college and noticed that so many of our friends stopped making films
1309683 you get married and get a job at starbucks and you realize you spent four years and 80 000 getting a film degree

1309688 its the story of an attractive young coed who unwittingly accepts a job as dogsitter to cerberus the three headed hound of hades
1309689 we want to put together people from the community including actors directors writers and lighting people
1309690 and we want to help them market their films and put them in front of audiences
1309691 too many people make films which sit on the shelf forever
1309692 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research

1309696 with the nasa news it will make our story more believable
1309697 we thought we could fix all of those things and that might be a business that would be big enough to interest henk
1309698 we wont have gasoline on blue mars things will be solar powered or hydrogen powered the look of the environment is sci fi in the year 2177 its totally alien to what we know we give creative freedom to developers like us to create cities that blend the familiar and the futuristic

1309744 senator obama supports investing in technology that could make coal a clean burning source of energy
1309745 however unless and until this technology is perfected senator obama will not support the development of any coal to liquid fuels unless they emit at least 20 percent less life cycle carbon than conventional fuels

1309749 acogemos con satisfacci n la noticia de que las autoridades han levantado hoy el bloqueo de nuestro sitio web en el centro de prensa de la sede ol mpica y posiblemente en otros lugares de pek n
1309750 sin embargo el bloqueo y el desbloqueo arbitrario de ciertos sitios supone un incumplimiento de la obligaci n de ajustarse a las normas internacionales sobre libertad de informaci n y expresi n

1309760 viene a confirmar lo que es de sentido com n
1309761 entendemos que el derecho a reducir la jornada laboral por razones de guarda legal debe ejercitarse dentro del horario de trabajo habitual sin que pueda suponer una libre elecci n de nuevos horarios sobre los que practicar dicha reducci n
1309762 dispone que quien por razones de guarda legal tenga a su cuidado a un menor de 8 a os tendr derecho a una reducci n de la jornada de trabajo con la disminuci n proporcional del salario entre al menos un octavo y un m ximo de la mitad de la duraci n de aquella

1309773 critically no diagnosis of sleep apnoea was made nor was mr wrighton referred to a consultant in sleep medicine
1309774 i appreciate that such a conclusion might be unpalatable to the family of mr tweddell but to return such a verdict i must be sure that someone owed the deceased a duty of care and that duty of care was breached and that breach caused the death of mr tweddell and the breach of duty was grossly negligent so as to amount to homicide
1309775 at the time of the accident mr wrighton was unaware of his condition
1309776 the four constituent parts necessary to formulate a verdict of unlawful killing are not in place
1309777 i turn now to the only verdict open to me one of accidental death
1309778 it is thus my intention to record that the verdict in the inquest of joseph tobias tweddell is one of accidental death

1309785 minded to give judgment in about a months time on the 12th of september
1309786 apparently for public consumption with no bearing on the case
1309787 both the harassment and the criminal damage offences were targeted very often to homes of the individuals involved and were vindictive in nature
1309788 by your own admission this course of action was intimidatory
1309789 we do have to say that we regard the charges and the offences against you as to be very very serious indeed so serious that custody would be an option

1309791 we dont even know one day where hell be the next and we dont know how well be able to visit him
1309792 if he does testify no matter what he says the prosecutor will charge him with perjury hes made that pretty clear to us
1309793 if he does not testify he can be charged with contempt and that was the road that my father chose one that was more principled i think in terms of his taking a stand against the governments abuse of power
1309794 if they can kill each other during ramadan they can appear before the grand jury all they cant do is eat before sunset
1309795 i am not going to put off dr grand jury appearance to assist in what is becoming the islamization of america
1309796 hes been singled out because hes been an effective courageous man
1309797 this all stems from aipac the american israel public affairs committee
1309798 this guy is just speaking out very effectively for the palestinian cause thats what is the root of this and the government is trying to stifle that
1309799 i believe that the defense is on firm ground saying that this is a case of political persecution
1309800 in fact i am hard pressed to find another case just like it
1309801 the prosecutions conduct is typical of the bush administration in that it will not accept defeat whether from a jury or a judge
1309802 when they fail to get the relief they seek they simply connive another way to secure it
1309803 its a sad day when you have to leave america to be free but thats the america we live in for some people at least
1309804 i call upon the congress to demand and insist on the abandonment of all forms of censorship
1309805 its best to enter competitions where even if one loses there is still something to be gained
1309806 the mystery of not knowing why your work was rejected can be frustrating and slightly damaging for artists
1309807 think about it this way you wouldnt submit your best sculpture to a painting competition would you
1309808 read the prospectus carefully and make sure you know what they are asking for if theres a particular juror listed you might want to do research on him or her if its a gallery owner maybe look at their gallerys website and see what type of work they sell to get a sense of the owners taste
1309809 i entered my first competition when i was 17 or 18
1309810 i entered because the juror was one of my favorite artists having him see my work was worth the investment
1309811 getting your work seen is the most important thing for an artist
1309812 any way you can do that you should everything else prizes or critiques is extra
1309813 everything is a competition sending work to galleries applying for grants even sending in a job application is competitive so submitting your work to shows is one part of a larger process in any profession
1309814 i tell my students the same thing theres no point in rejecting yourself
1309815 for the 2008 biennial i entered three paintings that were very different and showcased my range as an artist
1309816 regardless of how many paintings you have you want to represent what you do best and what has gotten the most positive feedback
1309817 when i judge artwork im giving my personal opinion i assume thats why ive been asked to participate
1309818 when im looking at the top entries which are all fine works of art my final decision comes down to what speaks to me what moves a pitfall for all jurors
1309819 i acknowledge that a piece of work is done in a style very different from my own but i can also recognize when it excels in that style and i give them credit for that
1309820 the trouble with being too nice is that it often goes hand in hand with other traits such as being too accommodating unwilling to speak up for yourself or hesitant to offer constructive criticism to your colleagues
1309821 the past travails of liberalism have forced him to bear
1309822 my interest is in making sure that weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done

1309856 we were set to work packaging bananas to be shipped for the front
1309857 you have no idea how the sight of those bananas tormented us could you imagine the tantalizing smell they emitted the nazi guard stood over us menacingly fingering his whip with one hand his rifle with the other our hunger tore at our innards the temptation was humanly impossible to withstand
1309858 one young girl standing at my side succumbed for a moment it appeared as if the nazi turned aside and she hurriedly slipped the banana into her mouth banana peel and all we all froze our fingers continued working on auto pilot

1309882 they are an interface between our bodies and the environment and in the future will prove a vital tool in health care we are creating clothing with sensors that does not intrude on the comfort of the patient with wires
1309883 this is an entirely new area but every day we are discovering ways of adding new functions to textiles it has so much potential our clothes will definitely play a very different role in the future
