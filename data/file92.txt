920012 people kick around the words mission critical until the expression is meaningless
920013 for drager mission critical means monitoring patients in the er icu or and everywhere in between drager has pioneered mobile patient monitoring and is turning to the leader in nonstop wireless trapeze networks for wireless infrastructure thats mission critical

920019 the fin is really three superior products in one a stand handle and cooling system that perfectly blends with the macbook line and adds to its overall form and function moreover the price point weve set means everyone can easily afford a fin of their own
920020 we achieved solid top line growth during the second quarter particularly in our european and asian markets
920021 we also improved efficiencies and product mix and increased value added service offerings which helped to improve our gross margin substantially despite the continued appreciation of the chinese renminbi and rising labor costs
920022 we have made great progress in our branded and retail expansion strategy in china during the first half of 2008 and we look forward to furthering that success in the second half of the year
920023 we have already opened 44 la go go retail stores this year and we are on track to achieve our goal of between 80 and 100 la go go stores in china in 2008
920024 we remain optimistic about la go gos prospects and we believe our retail business could account for 4 to 5 of total revenues for the full fiscal year
920025 as for our manufacturing operations our increased focus on making and selling products to the high end of the market helped us to expand our gross margins during the quarter and we expect to see similar results continue through 2008
920026 at the time the concept of showing digital video over ip or dsl or telephone lines was quite revolutionary
920027 and it was a big deal for a small new brunswick startup to be on the world stage
920028 to say it was a rush would be an understatement
920029 we had interviewed a couple of investment banking firms for the ipo and one said that we should wait because the market conditions were so bad
920030 the merrill guys said most of the drop has already happened and there is still a small window to get in and go public
920031 we were really disappointed but we werent alone just about every company of the same ilk was going down along with us
920032 the demand for our product proved to be right you see telephone companies now all over the world with iptv service we just came in too early
920033 a year earlier i had 3 million on paper and stock options and a year later im sitting in my kitchen and i owe 20 000 on a line of credit because i bought some shares
920034 youll have some lazy traders thatll be unusually disturbed by things that maybe wouldnt have the same kind of exaggerated effect on prices
920035 it leaves the market vulnerable to some unusual moves and sometimes the moves cant be justified other than the fact that a lot of the participants have gone away
920036 after a surprising drop in the number of people employed in june we expect the canadian labour market to rebound modestly in july and add 10 000 jobs to the employment ranks
920037 despite the expected turnaround in the canadian labour market in july the sluggish pace of canadian economic activity will continue to limit the extent of any employment gains going forward
920038 because of those two things the market has turned into an emotional rollercoaster
920039 we think that in june there will be a last gasp boost to income from the remainder of the stimulus cheques
920040 as a result personal income and spending are likely to be subdued

920051 my favorite anglo rage boy the best apoplectic brit blogger
920052 a widely acknowledged political genius of the first order still he finds time to visit greece sink a pint or two and take on the idiots who purport to govern our fair land
920053 there really is no purpose to be served by following humbly in the wake of the genius of mr eugenides why seek to improve on perfection when one knows in advance that one will fail
920054 i am impressed with the dexterity of mr e linguistic and otherwise
920055 i rather enjoyed the retort of the blogger known as mr eugenides

920071 he noted that themis is a licensee of ibms bladecenter blade chassis which unlike other blade chassis from hp dell or sun is an open architecture
920072 now you know why our sunray desktops at 4 watts apiece have been of such interest in the developing and developed world

920080 sun will push the envelope for what is possible with virtualization in the enterprise
920081 but this is pretty much what you said last year
920082 fmac isnt just a government issue of course its just as much an issue for a social networking site or a bank everyone wants simplified easy to use access controls consumers and corporations too
920083 banking is a technology business pure and simple i cant win if i dont have my own team
920084 all our other peers are well ahead of us in using outsourcing so now we will too
920085 first people came up with globalisation and we started having all the brands here
920086 pure and simple i cant win if i dont have my own team
920087 and would you like a quick update on the newest addition to our family mysql
920088 we dont run mysql we run name withheld to protect the proprietary
920089 we cant just let developers download software off the net you know weve got regulation and security to worry about
920090 um no i connected with a buddy of mine over at mysql and had him check youve downloaded mysql more than 1 300 times in the last twelve months
920091 actually everybody uses it why bother hassling with license agreements when mysqls got you covered were stoked you bought them
920092 well our sap system runs on about 50 nodes running linux
920093 not surprising as businesses throughout this globe are blissfully locked in by their existing it vendors hardware services and software offerings
920094 having worked with mysql i can tell you that it is not as robust as what we use does not have the support and can not run stored procedures portioned tables or several other things we need not bad for simple web sites but inadequate for what we do nice idea though
920095 by making the users give you money you are disincentivising them from using your software
920096 to win in the long run you have to win on both sides of the spectrum with the same product crippling products or sneaky licensing exceptions dont work freedom does
920097 our technologies after all are how your journalists file their stories and we play a central role in how you present them to the world via the network
920098 hey im not an unfeeling person why did i have that thought first
920099 and we play a central role in how you present them to the world via the network
920100 our technologies after all are how your journalists file their stories and we play a central role in how you present them to the world via the network i am unreservedly proud of suns role in making the world a more open transparent place

920104 if there were one company id love to acquire itd be mysql theyre an amazing company
920105 geez we have so much in common marten we see the world so similarly what would you think about becoming a part of sun
920106 weve been doing some thinking are you still interested in talking about an acquisition
920107 congratulations this is absolutely fantastic news for all of us
920108 microsofts sql server which also happens to run quite well on our systems btw
920109 dont do that youll step on the other guys toes
920110 there is a ton of value to be had just ask mysqls investors
920111 now thats a great question well tell you after were done
920112 a bi solution yes there are still a few un acquired bi companies and those happen to be open source
920113 it is fine to spent money on successfull open source projets but i would be also good to manage well suns big open source project java i am a very small french startup and java swing web service is very important for me just like mysql but i am sorry to say that java platform is not yet in janaury 2008 ready for web service please do manage suns open source project good just think like a mysql manager think about users simplicity usabillity weneed to have java thiner quicker to install more easy to program more easy to integreat with other standard web service it is not that complicated just mimic the flash player if you do it right and you do not need the 10 best programers of the world no you just need to make more java user and simple developer friendly prioryties then i bet you mr shwartz that next youtube service will be made in java platform
920114 and finally this acquisition will kickstart a new set of investments sun will be making into the academic community
920115 were putting a billion dollars behind the m in lamp
920116 not a single company in the cto room paid for software
920117 why dont you just buy an iphone or something that integrates it all
920118 no real business is going to use open source software
920119 hm didnt suns relationship with intel start with dinner too
920120 get the user to depend on solaris and the whole solaris software stack and then show them that the solaris software stack runs orders of magnitude better on sun hardware
920121 yes sun believes every server sold on this planet should be sold by sun and we are working hard to create the right products at the right price to make that happen
920122 we appreciate our partner dell beginning to sell our software on their servers you dont have to say that dell had to do it as demanded by their customers but make no mistake that we believe our servers are superior to dells and we will work hard to convert their customers into sun hardware customers as soon as possible

920128 i am so desperately sad that craig died from the injuries he sustained at brands hatch yesterday
920129 he was a really super young guy and only on the saturday evening was i chatting to him in the paddock with him telling me about his wsb ambitions for 2009 craig was so determined and professional would always say hello and enthusiastically keep me in touch with his progress
920130 britain has lost a wonderful rider whom i admired enormously and had every chance of being a future world champion it is fitting that the abiding memory so many of us will have of craig was him riding brilliantly battling for the lead of an incredible race in front of his home crowd it seems barely believable that such a freak accident claimed his life and i extend my deepest sympathies to his family and friends
920131 usda is committed to fostering a sustainable domestic biofuels industry at home in rural america
920132 these grants will broaden the sources of energy from many crops as well as improve the efficiency and options among renewable fuels
920133 cellulosic biofuels offer one of the best near to mid term alternatives we have on the energy production side to reduce reliance and imported oil and cut greenhouse gas emissions while continuing to meet the nations transportation energy needs
920134 developing cost effective means of producing cellulosic biofuels on a national scale poses major scientific challenges these grants will help in developing the type of transformational breakthroughs needed in basic science to make this happen
920135 there is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home

920138 i want to make sure that the council and the people of glasgow pay due respect to military personnel and their families
920139 these men and women who risk their lives for our country deserve greater recognition for their work and sadly in some cases for their sacrifices
920140 changing our policy on council tax benefit is a relatively small gesture by the council that could have a big impact financially on hundreds of war pensioners and their families
920141 estou contente com as disposi es que resultam dos trabalhos que tiveram lugar no parlamento e na comiss o dos pequenos produtores e produtos tradicionais
920142 venham facilitar a vida aos produtores se n o puser em causa a legalidade
920143 h um decreto de lei muito antigo o 28 84 que n o foi revogado e que tem disposi es considerando que o abate fora das instala es dos matadouros crime
920144 positivo tudo o que venha facilitar a vida aos produtores tradicionais que os ponha em situa o de concorr ncia menos desleal com outros parceiros comunit rios
920145 falta ainda muita coisa basta ver o relat rio do parlamento para ver que ainda falta uma boa s rie de medidas para facilitar a vida aos produtores mas o que j saiu j n o mau
920146 espero que estas medidas sejam mais do que portarias pois muitos produtores j tiveram de alterar os m todos de produ o
920147 se se obriga os produtores a fazer grandes mudan as as coisas descaracterizam se e ficam menos especificas o que uma pena porque patrim nio cultural que se perde
920148 gosh ibm does a lot of sports advertising who pays that their customers
920149 in 1990 sun pranksters brought to life one of president and ceo scott mcnealys favorite quotes
920150 so i asked my question how did pathetic back then emc kick mighty ibms butt during the 1990s
920151 im expecting our systems team to be just as focused on standalone storage and networking
920152 we knew we wanted solaris and our systems business to grow beyond their own boundaries we wanted customers to buy systems from us even if they werent running solaris and for them to buy solaris even if they werent running it on a sun system
920153 why should we bother talking to you how can you possibly differentiate its all a commodity to me
920154 how do we reach customers when we dont have a pre existing purchasing relationship based on pc procurement like our peers
920155 automatically receives a better value because of a better design
920156 ive received weeks of training about speeds amp feeds for our sun servers vs competition ive also spent 16 years at my former employer learning similar speeds amp feeds
920157 lock up at the strangest moments as well as draw blood as they catch your thumb
920158 you will cry for devine help as you try to figure out how to unlock them while attached to your flesh
920159 asking a manufacturing worker to hoist a server into a rack that doesnt have ball bearing tracks can be the straw breaking difference between a worker sleeping in their bed at home vs a bed at the hospital for the night
920160 if you learned everything there was to know about ibms products you would find out too much about each of them and then you would find out you couldnt sell any of them sometimes its just better not to know
920161 memory capacity at a maximum 128gb is double the others
920162 how come the stock tanked with such a good news
920163 weve obviously done a ton of work to support developers on all java based platforms
920164 the network is the computer the network would be googles computer
920165 the conspicuous absence of java in googles android announcement makes one wonder if java is going to be a part of android or google is just doing it to spite sun for reason you only know

920170 first sun did not approach netapps about licensing any of suns patents and never filed complaints against netapps or demanded anything netapps first approached storagetek behind the cover of a third party intermediary yes it sounds weird doesnt it seeking to purchase stk patents after sun acquired stk we were not willing to sell the patents weve always been willing to license them but instead of engaging in licensing discussions netapp decided to file a suit to invalidate them to be clear we never filed a complaint or threatened to do so nor did anyone to the best of my knowledge in the zfs community
920171 about 18 months ago suns lawyers contacted netapp with a list of patents they say we infringe and requested that we pay them lots of money
920172 it looks like zfs was a conscious reimplementation of our wafl filesystem
920173 like your post but will like you and sun better if you gpl your software
920174 now despite what you suggest we love where the fsfs gpl3 is headed for a variety of mechanical reasons gpl2 is harder for us with opensolaris but not impossible or even out of the question this has nothing to do with being afraid of the community if it was we wouldnt be so interested in seeing zfs everywhere including linux with full patent indemnity why does open sourcing take so long because were starting from products that exist in which a diversity of contributors and licensors licensees have rights we have to negotiate indulge me when i say its different than starting from scratch i would love to go faster and we are all doing everything under our control to accelerate progress remember we cant even pick gpl3 yet it doesnt officially exist its also a delicate dance to manage this transition while growing a corporation
920175 hey jerky give me some more of this great free software and step on it what heck no i aint contributing im an arm chair commando

920178 as a part of this suit we are requesting a permanent injunction to remove all of their filer products from the marketplace
920179 as for the actual subject of the blog entry it remains to be seen whos telling the truth right now theres a lot of he said she said going on and a single email from the middle of conversation isnt exactly convincing without all the conversations its too easy to cherry pick things that support one version or another the truth is probably somewhere in between

920218 physical characteristics the kinds of sex he preferred examples of sexual talk and a nickname he used for his private parts
920219 all the guys that you know got a lot of zeros you know in their bank accounts have checkered pasts man
920220 didnt want anything from me they just enjoyed having fun and you know probably liked hanging out with the sheriff thought that was cool and i liked hanging out with them cause i thought that was cool
920221 you wanna put me in jail for that put 12 people in the box and lets rock and roll
920222 calculated to kill by pneumonia etc anyone who attempts to solve it
920223 oh my god stares at the internet its starting again
920224 have a touch wheel on the back and display on the front so that numbers would be dialled from behind
920225 my ears are all wrong and michelle couldnt get her hair into an angela davis fro even if she wanted to
920226 i was very proud every time i passed the baseball stadium im excited even to think about the matches that will go on stage there next month
920227 many tiles on the roof of my house were broken in the quake and the pig shed collapsed although my hometown is more than 300 kilometers from the epicenter
920228 my parents are too old to do the repair work i also wanted to take time to see my son in chengdu he is in college a sophomore
920229 workers have to leave the city to find work elsewhere as they have nothing to do during the two month suspension but they did not complain we all understand this is a way to support the olympics
920230 the construction sector will almost come to a standstill in the two months ahead but we are confident of the post olympics prospects
920231 we used to fear wage defaults most but we are worried no more as long as we have good workmanship
920232 im really thankful to the birds nest i have improved myself because i can see the most advanced technologies materials and management im also impressed by the work environment catering and accommodation here
920233 from the statistics we have gathered over the past few days i believe the likelihood of rescheduling sporting events due to air quality concerns is very low
920234 should environmental departments foresee serious air pollution during the olympics beijing and neighboring areas will temporarily close more factories and pull more cars off the road
920235 i am pleased the governor has lent his approval to 99 percent of the appropriations the legislature approved as part of its fiscal 2009 budget plan
920236 its a good first step but i think its highly likely that he will use the emergency powers this fall to make additional cuts to deal with the states fiscal realities
920237 sita will now commence and fast track the process of finding a permanent ceo for the organisation
920238 we would obviously seek to conclude this process in the shortest possible timeframe and we will be making every effort to expedite the matter
920239 like any of us i do not control the conduct or actions of others
920240 as elected officials we in the legislature are all subject to the unfortunate inclination of others to use our name without our knowledge or authorization
920241 the law was originally passed to protect the lower level person from being hurt by the political changes that happen up here on beacon hill
920242 i think its been twisted to help the higher up people to benefit those who choose to move up knowing they might only be there a few years
920243 i dont have any preferences i could choose a team that offers me the best conditions or one in the chase for the postseason i dont care where i play
920244 the opening of the beijing tianjin intercity railway is another milestone in chinas history of railway development
920245 publix supports efforts to protect our environment and reduce the number of plastic bags sent to landfills every year we believe this is best done by encouraging recycling and the use of reusable bags not by government imposed bans or fees on bags
920246 this is one of the most irresponsible proposals i have seen seriously considered by the legislature in my 16 years
920247 we are just heading off a cliff thelma and louise with a smile on our face
920248 we cannot allow ourselves to operate with a blank checkbook mentality
920249 maybe i missed it they all said they had other options but there were none that i wrote down
920250 it is the worst of both worlds for the taxpayer and the toll payer
920251 i was the only one in the executive branch to display fiscal responsibility when the state needed it
920252 theres a physical mental and spiritual aspect to fitness classes for seniors
920253 its good to keep muscles strong and moving these classes also can help seniors improve flexibility coordination and balance
920254 its back to the old saying if you dont use it you lose it
920255 we have quite a few older adults who participate in our programs
920256 id say about 50 percent of our participants are 50 years or older
920257 and we talk about things like heart rate so if a participants heart rate is too high they can just walk or march to lower that rate
920258 there also are modifications so older adults are not pounding on their joints
920259 and the water provides a cushion so there is less impact on the joints
920260 the benefits muscle wise are that you keep your muscles strong
920261 it also helps women especially as far as not getting osteoporosis and keeping their bones strong
920262 keeping fit whether you are walking or riding a bike or participating in a fitness program is very important in terms of maintaining health and fitness
920263 exercise improves your quality of life it helps with energy levels it has been shown to fight off depression and anxiety
920264 strategically seen the saying is that you keep your friends close and your enemies closer
920265 china is a future colonial power in africa and it makes sense for south africa to seek favour now
920266 this is really the only alternative for south africa seeing as it regards the usa as an enemy and europe as an officious entity in africa
920267 the aim of the visits is to create inter continental ties with the east and the far east and to develop co operation
920268 is who you think you are who you want to be
920269 when my grandmother read that she was like what are they going to think theyre going to think were terrible that neptune city is an awful place well its not its one of those sad suburban towns thats still a great place to grow up
920270 i never used to want to admit where i was from
920271 and really it was charlotte where i went to college where i learned how to be a real musician the people i met there taught me how to write songs
920272 i grew up with all that in monmouth county sometimes in a spooky way and they all influence my songwriting
920273 a way of singing that suited my voice my body the way i felt
920274 it was you know have you ever heard of jon bon jovi
920275 so i got really nervous and i got really drunk and i did bon jovis livin on a prayer but i did it tongue in cheek
920276 after that when i asked the owners whats up for next week
920277 it sounds like a big glamorous actress from the 50s falling down the stairs
920278 as you should be aware one of bon jovis most popular songs is entitled
920279 we hereby demand that you immediately cease and desist all further use of the name
920280 this business has nothing to do with bon jovi nor was it inspired by him
920281 mijovi is about building a brand that emphasizes personal and global responsibility the name itself was inspired by jovi short for jovita which means jovial life bon jovi makes music and mijovi makes lifestyle beverages
920282 i dont think anybody is going to be confused about mijovi drink with caffeine and the songs that bon jovi sings or jon bon jovi
920283 the one went to europe and homage must be paid
920284 these women believe that all it takes is willpower but thats just not the case
920285 if i can make it 10 more days until my next checkup i can get this 20 gift certificate it helps you rally the willpower you need
920286 piano tuning and rebuilding is not common and some think it is a dying art
920287 certainly there are not as many in the trade as 25 years ago though more pianos are made and sold today in the last 20 to 25 years there has been a surge in the building and restoration business because a lot of the pianos were made in the pre depression era and things are going wrong but these pianos still have a great deal of integrity
920288 mr milligan was probably the one who led me down this primrose path
920289 he demonstrated pianos but he couldnt play as i got more proficient in knowing how to play he would call and ask me to come over and play the piano for customers because he couldnt see that well and his natural dexterity was not that good he would tell me how to fix those pianos he took in on trade so he could sell them
920290 he gave me the encouragement and worked me through my first real repairs and restringing
920291 a lot of people when they think of a piano tuner they think of someone who comes in and makes a piano sound good being a technician is a step further and being a rebuilder is a real leap
920292 in terms of appearance its as if they brought back a different piano to our house
920293 it was a beautiful piano but it was hiding under 100 years of gunk
920294 i like henrys attitude hes very enthusiastic and hard working
920295 he makes the piano sound as good as it can even improves factory sound
920296 you cant do your best in performing on a piano thats in bad shape
920297 great deal of satisfaction and after you finish them its hard to give them back theyre like your kids
920298 if it is effective the ultimate outcome will be better health care and improved cost effectiveness
920299 frankly it may cost more on the drug side but less in overall expense
920300 we in health care education tend to think less of being persuasive and more about teaching
920301 our job is to provide good evidence in such a way that it will be persuasive
920302 theres no reason to resent what these people do theyre trying to help
920303 a biokineticist will be helping him with an exercise routine and a psychologist will deal with his emotional side as often after surgery some patients experience depression
920304 it will start fairly soon as long as no pressure is placed on his chest for the moment he will be able to walk or use an exercise bike
920305 many patients feel a major improvement after surgery because their deterioration had been quite slow they need to be careful that they dont rush it
920306 we have had people who have had bypass operations who have run marathons and done the argus cycle tour
920307 quant au passage de la ligne il a eu lieu le samedi 28 nous avons d nous pr ter joyeusement une mascarade derri re un type d guis en neptune un autre en amphytrite et le commodore ronald warwick entour de jolies filles en maillot
920308 waarom geeft een antwoordapparaat nooit antwoord als ik iets vraag
920309 no i think i should go see that with jon
920310 i come in every day look at the fundamentals and conclude the zar should be weaker
920311 such accelerated moves are often associated with the late stage of a market move but trading against this trend will be brave
920312 now we have a sitting president under question even as the president in waiting jacob zuma goes to court today with the support of a mass mobilisation campaign
920313 a good novel tells us the truth about its hero but a bad novel tells us the truth about its author
920314 there is a great deal of difference between an eager man who wants to read a book and the tired man who wants a book to read
920315 ah u like lah get to hug and be hugged by him
920316 were fighting through a rough time right now were a close knit team well keep battling and hopefully turn it around
920317 if youre going to give me the ball at fenway ill take it any time
920318 youre going to take my left arm before you tell me i cant go out there
920319 this is a tough league when youre not putting pitches exactly where you want to
920320 he was a little disappointed but it is the big leagues and you have to perform at this level
920321 my last couple of starts ive kind of come to the ballpark the next day in i hope they dont send me down mode i know my stuff is good just not right now i think its just working on my mindset and getting my confidence back
920322 the guy has more movement than any pitcher in the game
920323 whether youre a veteran or a young guy its a tough matchup and then you have to add all the peripheral things he does
920324 you know hell be in the hall of fame weve seen him for well forever
920325 greg and i are friends i see him a lot in the off season
920326 when its all said and done after the game well maybe a couple of days after you appreciate what hes done
920327 but during the game no im not going to give him that credit im trying to beat him
920328 i know what to expect from him and hell still dupe you
920329 he can get you out with a pitch and he wont throw it again you never know what youll get from him
920330 the bullpen pitched a good last three i can think of a few games where i pitched better and a couple of those i lost
920331 its a way to encourage the victims to rebuild the torch is a symbol of strength and will encourage them to carry on the tenacious struggle
920332 im very excited this is a hard hit area during all the aftershocks people needed hope
920333 they needed to look ahead the torch in mianyang is a type of hope for the future and for rebuilding
920334 they get a group of them together circle an area then go to work
920335 yes you may be able to save some trout but there are subtle things that can go on that im not sure that fishermen think about
920336 if you look at pelican colonies around the west theyre kind of boom and bust
920337 these two colonies have had a lot of growth over the years but it was just a matter of time before they crashed
920338 from the data we have 80 to 90 percent of their diet is trash fish
920339 it kind of boils down between a fight between whats most important managing a species of greatest conservation need and appeasing the sportsmen that pay for managing the sport fish
920340 the pelicans have really lined up on the banks and rocks of the blackfoot river
920341 its not the ideal time to stock rainbow trout but its the only time to stock them and survive
920342 these birds and these fish evolved together but theyre in a somewhat altered ecosystem
920343 whatever happens well have to weigh all the competing interests
920344 no similar weapon in the service of armies in the world
920345 in fact they shook hands you did not see them because you were hiding behind the podium but they will do it again
920346 they are all definitely coming they have assured me that they will come
920347 i dont have a coin to decide who will speak first
920348 what about in the order in which we came in
920349 chamisa chamisa mudhara uyu akangwarisa ave kutotitsotsa totokangwarira pama talks chamisa chamisa we have to be wary of this old man he is already out foxing us we have to watch him when it comes to the talks
920350 i am basically already using the iphone as a replacement for my computer
920351 in the end we compromised our principles but after all
920352 for those of us who track data breaches regularly it came as no surprise
920353 a lot of these breaches could have been avoided if people had taken a proactive stance or put policies in place
920354 we have the coaches calling out the plays but theyre not going to be in the games
920355 so i get into the huddle and try to listen to the quarterbacks rhythm
920356 when it comes right down to it im ready for whatever this team needs me to do
920357 theres no doubt about that i cant stress that anymore i feel prepared i feel ready i know i learned a lot last year even though i didnt get to play that much at all i think it did benefit me in many ways at this point now im ready to play and im ready to go
920358 when it comes right down to it im ready for whatever this team needs me to do
920359 tony romo told me to continue to be patient and work on things
920360 they both were very inspiring and gave some helpful tips i think i can take away while not being on the field right away they kind of shared that eagerness and the competitiveness about wanting to get in there and want to play
920361 but i have a role to play right now and thats to get healthy we have a great group of guys its awesome to be a part of this right now obviously im not on the field but im trying like crazy to be out there im not going to rush ill be back out there eventually
920362 but at the present time hes got a lot of things hes trying to learn right now we dont have to unnecessarily put a bigger load on his shoulders
920363 if theres a need we can but we wouldnt do it just to do it
920364 we emphatically tell israel that ending the occupation of arab and palestinian lands withdrawing from there and implementing legitimate international resolutions are the only way to realize just permanent and comprehensive peace
920365 now im back at united the plan is to try and force my way into the first team plans
920366 it was great going away with the first team squad ive had some good games and really enjoyed myself but now it would be good to get pre season out of the way and start scoring goals
920367 we are very upset about sneijders injury its serious and its the worst news we could have
920368 he is very bad very upset he is crying because it is a very serious problem and very painful
920369 do you personally have any regrets about what you did campaigning for your wife
920370 yes but not the ones you think and it would be counterproductive for me to talk about
920371 there are things that i wish id urged her to do things i wish id said things i wish i hadnt said
920372 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked him obama personally
920373 whats this is this what arabs are doing to each other allahu akbar god is great where are the muslims where is the world
920374 i believe this is the end of the oslo authority because all papers are now on the table and theres nothing left to hide
920375 they are talking very clearly now they are accepting israel and the resolutions that are against islam
920376 there is no way according to islamic teachings to accept an occupier on the land this is not only in palestine its also in and iraq when we talk about occupied palestine we mean the land from the river to the sea not only the west bank and gaza there is no room for the state of israel when they move out of all of palestine as a state there can be peace
920377 the us administration has the right to consider the annapolis a brilliant victory but not for the palestinian people only for israel
920378 while the bush administration and israel may consider what happened and what could happen to destroy the palestinian cause a victory we consider it a defeat for a just and comprehensive peace
920379 palestine is arab islamic land from the river to the sea including jerusalem there is no room in it for the jews
920380 i see willingness on our part for a change and i would be very pleased to see it on their part as well
920381 any peace initiative that does not include the syrian golan heights is not serious and will not achieve a comprehensive just peace in the region
920382 stop talking about annihilating israel and instead turn your terror war into a struggle for human rights then you will have the american people eating out of your hand
920383 this organization the plo does not exercise any regional sovereignty over the west bank in the hashemite kingdom of jordan in the gaza strip or the himmah area
920384 we are trying our best to sign players at the moment chief executive peter lawwell is active at the moment working very hard
920385 from the players point of view im hopeful the squad can be added to before the start of the season if it doesnt i get on with it
920386 its unfair to talk about targets lets just say we are active in quite a few places
920387 i dont know if gareth barry will leave aston villa or not but i am not on his case
920388 i like gareth barry and i like two or three other players it is better i dont speak about names i said that yesterday it is better i leave things to your imagination and creation
920389 i want to stay and prove i can cut it in the premier league
920390 the experts came and analysed all the documents and we all see it when they were around
920391 we are able to see at the tribunal about multiple thumb printing massive rigging and how several other electoral malpractices were carried out we saw it here in the open
920392 i am a nigerian born and bred in nigeria and i want to say that i met all requirements as demanded by the inec before anybody can stand in for an election in this country
920393 we have reached a milestone to rescue ekiti from the holocausts that have ravaged ekiti in the last one year and of course we have reached a reasonable level in our petition
920394 the election was free fair and devoid of violence as alleged by the petitioner
920395 my lord when i got to the polling unit there were a lot of voters and i joined the queue they insisted that i should go to the front and cast my vote but in my typical self i decided to remain on the queue immediately i cast my vote i left the polling station for home
920396 speciafically i cannot find where they pleaded the issue of biro or colour to be used in accreditation saying all they pleaded was accreditation
920397 my first few games i was relying on my catchers a lot they know these teams better than i do
920398 but once you get in a groove like i did today you stop thinking and just start throwing
920399 the transfer negotiations are still going on as far as i know
920400 i think so ive no reason to believe he wont andy johnson is a player with great quality wherever hes been hes done very very well hell give us balance up front that were looking for
920401 i want to stay and prove i can cut it in the premier league
920402 i dont know if gareth barry will leave aston villa or not but i am not on his case
920403 i like gareth barry and i like two or three other players it is better i dont speak about names i said that yesterday it is better i leave things to your imagination and creation
920404 the transfer negotiations are still going on as far as i know

920406 i dont know if gareth barry will leave aston villa or not but i am not on his case
920407 i like gareth barry and i like two or three other players it is better i dont speak about names i said that yesterday it is better i leave things to your imagination and creation

920413 with the writers strike it took so long to get underway and roger avary the writer had a commitment that was in line before working the wolfenstein stuff but ive recently been in contact with roger and hes actually working on the script right now
920414 me kind of nagging on him hey is it done yet hey is it done yet
920415 chronic blink on him he thought i was mocking him
920416 i was getting away with it at first because we were in sync it was only when i sneezed and threw the timing out that he cottoned on
920417 they were all doing a mexican wave at the time in fact i think was him that set them all off
920418 i tend to find myself moving around quite a bit to help with my nerves
920419 theyre just as stressed at home wanting to know whats going on
920420 but you worry you worry if theyre gonna get hit by a pitch
920421 i have a high schooler and when they mess up they can sit them on the bench
920422 i feel relaxed if im away from everything and not right up in the middle of the action but im kind of laid back so i dont get really nervous now my husband he paces enough for both of us
920423 its the most exciting thing and i get so nervous
920424 i sit here and ive got my fingers crossed every time hes up there whether hes pitching or up to bat it can be nerve wracking we sit here and were all just hoping and praying were just wanting these boys to win
920425 kids grab the towels and the sun screen were gonna indulge in an all day relaxathon at the pool
920426 have you lost your mind i thought you had drowned
920427 do you know how scared i was i thought i had lost you
920428 for as high as the heavens are above the earth so great is his love for those who fear him

920431 fans flocked to toyota park friday night to cheer on fc barcelona as the team took the field for training to kick off their two match tour of the usa a heat index of 90 plus couldnt keep the crowd away
920432 hes someone we have talked about in the past said clint hurdle whose team made a late run at hernandez as a free agent in february several rockies players are pulling for the team to sign hernandez 10 8 5 48 as a fifth starter
920433 during the first half of 20th century many american artists visualized the modernist faith in science and empirical knowledge individuals such as josef albers lazlo moholy nagy and frederick kiesler transported the revolutionary aims of the european avant garde especially those of russian constructivism and the bauhaus to the united states where a homegrown modernism emerged their influence can be seen in works as varied as barnett newmans transcendent abstractions and robert rauschenbergs technology driven carnal clocks other artists are more neutral or even critical in their responses to changes wrought on the american landscape and psyche ed ruscha addresses modernitys linear advancement with cool detachment tracking its effects over the passage of time while the works of louis guglielmi and robert graham register an acute postwar anxiety toward urban sprawl and consumerism the exhibition also features work by contemporary artists including paul sietsema glenn ligon and sherrie levine who mine specific moments in the history of modernism to investigate the ways in which notions of progress have been used to construct systems of power and subjectivity that continue to affect contemporary life
920434 but in my prime not even a contest lets just say i have a better chance of stopping him than him stopping me
920435 not even a contest ive got a much better chance of stopping him then he has of stopping me
920436 we heard the sound of the hail coming down from the sky
920437 it was really pouring and thundering and ally was holding on to my shirt staying right by my side wherever i went and jaden was just really sullen sitting on his bed with his blankie then the wind started blowing and they started crying and really freaking out
920438 they were apprehensive at first but then they started running back and forth and laughing and we were splashing and it was like they forgot all about what they were scared of
920439 now you understand us women we have to swallow many things
920440 dass offene dachfonds st rker wachsen als geschlossene konnten wir schon in den vorangegangenen dachfondsstudien beobachten neu ist allerdings dass aus dachfonds mit geschlossener architektur mittel abflie en
920441 vor allem das um 13 prozent gesunkene xetra volumen dr ckt aus die stimmmung
920442 deshalb glauben wir nicht dass neue wettbewerber wie chi x der hauptgrund f r die r ckl ufige volumenentwicklung sind
920443 we have recovered 10 charred bodies and sent five others to hospitals with critical burn injuries
920444 most of the bodies could not be recognised as they were so badly burnt
920445 the airhostess knew how nervous i was so even before take off she handed me a set of headphones tuned it to a station that had some nice spiritual sounds and told me to close my eyes
920446 sure enough the chants calmed me down and i didnt pay too much attention to the fact that i was actually flying
920447 in hindsight while the ambience was perfect it was the music that did the trick for me
920448 the sounds were upbeat but not fast something i really didnt have to pay attention to in order to enjoy but it had a soothing effect on my nerves
920449 most of us are so hyper stimulated by the end of the day that we really need something that allows us to close our eyes and soak in the ambience
920450 thats why id rather go to a lounge bar for a drink with friends instead of a loud noisy and boisterous joint where i have to keep repeating myself

920700 tell me would you describe yourself more as a process or a function
920701 apparently this group has got the market cornered on stupid
920702 i think we bond over what songs we like best
920703 ive never been good at any video games ever i have no hand eye coordination im absolutely horrible at anything that requires pointing and shooting
920704 but i can press buttons theyre ordered and theyre colored
920705 it gives you a fun social thing to do its almost like a party game everyone will have something to do its real fun and engaging
920706 the hardest part about teaching a child to play the guitar is having their fingers toughened
920707 in this game its plastic buttons that they press its easier for them to have access to feeling like a player
920708 the thing i saw was guys glad to be back glad to see each other and glad to take the next step
920709 that enthusiasm hasnt always been there i was glad to see that
920710 i think we have a chance to have the best team weve had so far
920711 i think the players are ready for a change of pace
920712 its tough because deon is a really good person as well as a really good ballplayer
920713 but we understand that there are more important things than football i know we all wish him the best
920714 wallace leaving obviously opens things up for walker sails and the other guys now its kind of a logjam
920715 there was nothing broken or anything the trainers just wanted to keep it immobilized
920716 im ready to get back to the cajun culture they dont celebrate mardi gras in west texas when you grow up around something like that its hard to be away from it
920717 im excited about coming home and ready to get back to my roots
920718 they recruited me out of high school but at the time texas tech was just the better fit ive always enjoyed coach mike and stef
920719 they made me feel like i could have fun in my final year
920720 legislation in the first special session this year added a significant level of new disclosure for members of most of these boards a much higher level than could be reasonably be expected of volunteers who often attend only a few meetings a year
920721 it strikes a reasonable and appropriate balance between requiring some level of financial disclosure for members of boards and commissions while respecting the privacy of private citizens
920722 that short time frame didnt give people enough time to review the revised requirements
920723 many people were clearly uncertain about what type of disclosure they would have to make and when there is doubt the natural tendency is to resign
920724 as future members of boards and commissions consider the new requirements we believe they will view them as a reasonable level of transparency and not an obstacle to public service
920725 i think that if john is the nominee he has got some convincing to do to convince people that he is a solid conservative and ill be glad to help him if he is the nominee
920726 probably some personal animosity toward me you cant please all the people all the time
920727 we are sending out requests today to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games
920728 we are also urging video game arcades to pull the games from service
920729 he said he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game
920730 this time bomb has already exploded and the situation could get worse
920731 today it is a cab driver but tomorrow it could be a video game shop owner
920732 we hebben een aantal interessante idee n om deze ps2 gamers te bereiken en ze op te krikken naar een ps3
920733 de besturing en de toegankelijkheid ervan is als een snack in mijn optiek leiden wij en zijn we zeker niet diegene die volgen nintendo heeft haar eigen ding en wij zijn niet bezig om de seniorengroep aan het gamen te krijgen
920734 we hebben niet de intentie om een van deze giganten te worden
920735 we kunnen natuurlijk best klein zijn maar toch extreem winstgevend en succesvol
920736 de laatste tijd zijn er een aantal idiote gevallen van overnames geweest waarbij het om belachelijke bedragen ging
920737 opeens denken ontwikkelaars dat ze tien keer zoveel waard zijn als dat werkelijk het geval is
920738 thank you lyric angela tk a line of proper lyrics i love you africa straka
920739 what we have said is that if they bring a programme that contradicts our social and cultural values they attract a sanction and the nbc is under instructions to make sure that the rules are strictly applied
920740 there is no intention to ban big brother africa reality programme
920741 you would agree with me that it is important that we do not create a negative impression that we do not want investments to come to nigeria but if the programme does not meet the requirement of the nbc the nbc is under instructions to censor or ban it outright
920742 but as at this moment we have no reason to discourage business for multi choice big brother africa is not being banned we are asking them to repackage the programme the national assembly and indeed the senate is not banning any business from coming into nigeria
920743 what we are saying is that whatever business that is coming should accord without social and cultural values and it should be rolled out in conformity with existing laws of our land
920744 we told them that they must eliminate drunkenness that they must eliminate explicit nudity that they must eliminate shower hours or move it to a time when nobody is watching it and we also have told them and they have agreed that there must be definite punishment for misbehaviours
920745 for instance all that time that richard took advantage of ofunneka in the last edition of the programme we all know what happened there was no reason why richard should not have been punished and so many other things
920746 we have agreed with them that they have to design things inside the programme to make sure that anybody who misbehaves is punished
920747 je vais le sortir ce blog et je bosserai sur le th me plus tard
920748 especially its something we dont look forward to doing its something that we can put off without discipline
920749 for some kids its right after school but some other kids might need some down time
920750 it wouldnt necessarily be our first choice its kind of like choosing between doing four or five different roads
920751 your first choice for a project might not be ready for any one of a number of reasons so you move to maybe your third choice in this case the money is there and the desire is there
920752 the judges have already let us know that when this does start there will be monitors at the vents and as soon as there is asbestos in the vents they will shut it down
920753 on the other hand were not reinventing the wheel this has been done in hospitals schools and other courthouses you can block everything coming from the seventh floor and just seal it off
920754 we need more square footage and more floor space for dispatch communications
920755 as the city and parish grows and the population grows we get busier and need more dispatchers were definitely at the point now where we need more space
920756 i think that any reasonable person would agree that lafayette in 2008 is not lafayette in 1965 in which the parish population was about 80 000
920757 currently we have more than 200 000 people the lcg is talking about renovating the basement and seventh floor for 911 which doesnt even address the needs of the clerk the district court or the district attorney all of our space needs are not being addressed
920758 dont expect to get the best interest rate the mortgage lender has to offer
920759 it isnt always possible for fair isaac to distinguish a heloc home equity credit line from other types of revolving credit its one of those vagaries between lenders and credit bureaus that frustrates score developers
920760 its huge because to win these tournaments is tough nowadays
920761 ive played five days in these conditions and had eight or nine matches in the last couple of weeks but ive put in the physical work and its paid off
920762 i got very nervous and he was hitting the ball really big but i hung in well
920763 it was tough for both of us and there were a lot of long rallies your legs really burn out there and they were some of the hardest conditions of the year
920764 but i stayed calm throughout and didnt waste any energy especially when i went behind in a couple of matches
920765 in the past maybe id have let that get to me but now im playing top players on a regular basis and im better equipped
920766 well done to andy it is his first masters series but i am sure there are going to be a lot more
920767 pietersen is respected very much as a player he is a star but would anybody run through a brick wall for him
920768 peter is very good man with a good staff but the results are not there i have been there i know what employers are like the results are everything
920769 i had not known of a spirit to reincarnate and in this my disappointment has been grievous karma exists in the spirit world and many spirits of my association have become pure and perfected spirits through renunciation yet they have remained spirits and have progressed to the highest realms without taking another body
920770 when comparing the most advanced mortals in mind and soul condition they are not equal to us in development this makes me wonder what improvement could be made in our condition in order for us to progress should we enter into another mortal body yet strangely we cling to our old belief in reincarnation and congregate together waiting for something that must happen in order for reincarnation to become the destiny of our souls
920771 when i reached the spirit world i found such glory and happiness and beauty that i now realize this little earth is a grammar school not a university or even a high school it is only the first lesson of life
920772 you can learn in one day here what takes years to learn on earth forget reincarnation because it is a sandbag around your neck you will have it so centered on your mind that you will think of nothing else and you will stay just where you are you cannot progress because your mind will always revert to the earth again you cannot live on the earth more than once life is progression not retrogression
920773 i studied reincarnation in india and thought there was truth and justice in the theory that we come back to learn and grow i taught the theory and wanted to bring it to the world i felt that i remembered far back into my past but i was mistaken when you become sensitive and can feel the spirits around you they speak to you by impressions and their past will be like a panorama a person feels it and will relive the past of spirits but the mistake is made of taking this for the memory of past incarnations i did not know this when i lived on earth but when i came to the spirit side of life i learned differently once you reach the spirit world where all is congenial where all is life where all is bliss where there is no jealousy no envy where all is one grand harmony do you think for one moment that you would want to leave that beautiful condition to come back to earth and be a little baby restricted in mind and knowing nothing whatever
920774 take the chair in front of us and try not to be nervous
920775 what are all these spirits doing in the room get them out of here
920776 you do this you do that this reading is over
920777 it is historys sorrow the grief of our era that i carry about me like an anathema
920778 they had to fight to get to me to get to me is like getting to the wizard of oz they had to prove themselves they had to walk down the yellow brick road
920779 but the show isnt about just seeing if i could find someone to work for me its about people chasing their dreams i dont say it in a cocky way but i take pride in being one of the best at doing what i do
920780 theyve been keeping the relationship quiet for months and trying to pass each other off as just good friends
920781 but theyve decided it isnt a fling its for life so they want to make their romance public dina is still working on the date of the party but its looking like towards the end of the year
920782 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
920783 you know what guillermo thinks that i should go to amsterdam and take an acid trip and it would fix my head i think he could be right you know
920784 ive done some things to excess but i hate pot and ive never done acid or ecstasy
920785 the franchising team is thrilled to have been granted this status it amounts to a seal of approval and quality assurance for the franchising advice they provide the team is vastly experienced having advised both franchisors and franchisees over many years
920786 are sentosa cove resort homes proving to be a good investment choice
920787 customers have become increasingly promotion and deal driven impacting margins
920788 it is because of this influence that i finally decided to record my music but the road has not been easy because i have had several false starts before i could record this project
920789 i owe it all to my elder brother nigel my family members and all the music aces whom i have worked with at various studios
920790 our interviews in zambia were very tough they were almost like one hour long but i was shocked when i got a call that i had progressed to the next round because delta and sharon were worthy contenders too
920791 the hard part was to tell delta and sharon that i had made it to the next round
920792 i have accepted that i am different and i am not really offended by people who fail to understand me
920793 in the past i used to have low self esteem because i was a very self conscious kid rude comments made by people would make me tend to be a shy kid but now i am not bothered at all
920794 i would like to tell my fellow people who are like me that there is nothing really different with us there is need for people to liberate themselves first and send the right vibe and people wont treat them differently
920795 while we should continue to spread the gospel of abstinence we should also come up with other new solutions at tertiary institutions i have realised that some youths are shy to go to the campus clinic to purchase or take condoms
920796 so i believe these contraceptives should be placed somewhere where youths are comfortable to take and use them like in their rooms etc unlike placing them in public places
920797 we dont have to treat people living with hiv and aids differently because that would be like rubbing salt into an open wound there is need for us to stop stigmatising them because stigma breaks up communities
920798 attributable to musical works associated with mtukudzi either in undocumented works or in non society status
920799 it is not permissible in terms of cisac rules that a person can be a member of more than one society for the same territory
920800 mtukudzi was a member of both societies for the territory of the
920801 that was an apparent attempt to resolve the clash in membership with zimra a situation that was not entirely resolved as he still continued to be a member of zimra for the world territory
920802 we have on file a number of correspondences from 1998 to him directly where we explain this fact and encourage him to go through a formal process of requesting the societies to which he belongs to grant him release in order to apply for samro membership
920803 the zimra account for all royalties payable to that society had been put on suspense since the latter part of 2006 but that has now received attention and royalties will be paid through to zimra we are currently investigating the reasons for such a suspension
920804 mtukudzi often spells his surname differently he interchangeably uses mtukudzi and mutukudzi as reflected in his application for membership to samro and his registration by either zimra and or gema on the ipi
920805 it is not usual that a person can spell his her surname differently and some times in the same document this creates serious complications with documentation especially when users supply performance returns
920806 your gema account shows a credit of euro 28459 29 the credit could be transferred to your bank account if the question of the simultaneous membership with gema and zimra and tax questions could be clarified
920807 please let us have confirmation of yourself and zimra saying that you and or zimra agree with the worldwide administration of your exploitation rights by gema excluding the territory of zimbabwe
920808 in respect of your questions i can confirm that i personally have not applied to samro for membership and i can confirm that i personally have never received any income from samro
920809 tuku music has applied for membership at samro as a publisher tuku music has never received any income from samro
920810 he is claiming that he had not been paid for the past 10 years this means that he was last paid in 1998 but records here show that in 1998 he received royalties from samro through us
920811 maybe the question is whether mtukudzi is querying what he was paid and not that he was not paid anything
920812 you will note that after we had cleared his membership position with us giving gema rights to collect his royalties abroad the funds stopped coming in
920813 should steer the cyclone generally westward or west northwestward toward the upper texas and western louisiana coasts
920814 parallel to the louisiana coast on monday and approach the upper texas coast on tuesday

920816 because it might make an impact to the texas shore were looking at activating resources including search and rescue and maybe military forces
920817 what seems to have happened is the staff who run the website had never heard of lolita and to be honest no one else here had either we had to look it up on wikipedia but we certainly know who she is now
920818 surely were all aware these days of the impact that needless waste has on our environment
920819 instead of assuming is an opportunity to 1 save your business the cost of the carrier bag 2 demonstrate to your customer that you care about the environment both local and worldwide and 3 encourage people to recycle their old carrier bags

920917 he could pick somebody that is solid and attractive to the base and independents
920918 our office is not involved in any outside political activities related to the presidential campaign or otherwise
920919 the united states abstained in the vote because language added to the resolution would send the wrong signal to sudanese president beshir and undermine efforts to bring him and others to justice
920920 take advantage of the situation and step up their campaign
920921 khartoums cooperation in promoting progress in the political process and its full cooperation with the icc

920961 it was unfortunate that some oil blocs were revoked when it was not necessary causing the country to lose so much money in litigations and the attendant embarrassments

921074 how many times have we heard the dems insist that they support the troops its one of their mantras if something isnt for the children its to support the troops but its false just as their insistence last fall that they wouldnt cut and run was all of that pales in comparison to one single fact reid and the rest of the democrats do not condemn defeat they do not say they would have done better to win because the words win and victory never pass their lips they never propose an idea that might lead to quicker more decisive victory in iraq or afghanistan or the horn of africa or lebanon or anywhere else no the democratic pathology is the same now as it was forty years ago what then is the import of what sen reid said first reid and his ilk do not support the troops when reid says the war is lost the troops hear they understand that they are still risking their lives every day for a war the democrats are content to lose there can be no more destructive assault on their morale
921075 all of us denounce war all of us consider it mans greatest stupidity and yet wars happen and they involve the most passionate lovers of peace because there are still barbarians in the world who set the price for peace at death or enslavement and the price is too high

921116 to avoid controversy on the eve of the election we did not organise any meeting and we kept everyone informed through the newsletter and other correspondence
921117 the environmental organisations are already against the agreement signed with the government this was already evident in a section of the press lets not be foolish
921118 if these conditions are imposed on our boathouses in armier we will not accept them therefore i warn all those involved to act according to the terms of the agreements which the government has promised to honour
921119 i want religion to stop taking society and the vulnerable for idiots
921120 it is my turn to follow lars vilks and provoke a sensible discussion about religion
921121 publicly condemn this unprovoked attack against christ and his followers
921122 we further challenge the media to cover this affront to christianity with the same vigor as recent stories about cartoon depictions of mohammed and other offenses to the muslim community
921123 the folsom street fair is reminiscent of biblical sodom and gomorrah and the media should document what the city of san francisco is allowing to occur in public in the name of tolerance
921124 this is the way it goes frank well saunter into the bank dressed as cowboys well pull our neckerchiefs over our faces and wander around the bank take a look at the safe peek out the window and say nice day isnt it or ever had a bank robbery around these parts well keep our hands on our guns but wont draw them no matter what marshall dillon will hurry over from the marshalls office place us under arrest and drag us down to the jailhouse well protest well say were poor working cowboys were tired of being picked on well hire texas jack cochrane and hell charge dillon with occupational profiling for persecuting poor working cowboys like was done by the earps at dodge city and by marshall cogburn in the territories well sue the pants off em
921125 it was false imprisonment they were aware of their captivity
921126 they behave in a non violent but suspicious manner to get themselves pulled off the aircraft with the result of a civil suit against the airline
921127 we didnt do anything wrong but they made everybody scared of us
921128 these are some of the most pro american people around said garcia yes indeed some of them were born in america apparently they are going to use that as an argument
921129 this is the face of prejudice and racism that happens today
921130 anyone who sacrifices liberty in order to gain security deserves neither
921131 by this definition its theirs not websters people of color cannot be racists because as peoples within the u s system they do not have the power to back up their prejudices hostilities or acts of discrimination
921132 like it or not you are all future leaders and the world is diverse so learning to embrace and appreciate that diversity is essential
921133 we reject the u n reject america reject all law and order
921134 dont lobby congress or protest because we dont recognize congress the only relationship you should have with america is to topple it eventually there will be a muslim president in the white house dictating the laws of shariah
921135 the muslim woman was given a role duties and rights 1 400 years ago that most women do not enjoy today even in the west
921136 treat women well for they are like domestic animals and they possess nothing themselves
921137 and we should educate our children about all holidays equally i was disappointed that the board eliminated them they have been restored sort of all we have to do is add one holiday to it and not favor one holiday over another
921138 how can we bring ourselves to congratulate or wish people well for disobeying allah
921139 they are surely disbelieving who blaspheme and say god is one of three in the trinity for there is no ilah god except one allah
921140 fight those who do not believe in allah or the last day who do not forbid that which has been forbidden by allah and his messenger or acknowledge the religion of truth even if they are people of the book christians and jews until they pay the jizya tribute tax in submission feeling themselves subdued and brought low
921141 verily they are disbelievers and infidels who say the messiah son of mary is god
921142 first they came for the communists and i didnt speak up because i wasnt a communist then they came for the trade unionists and i didnt speak up because i wasnt a trade unionist
921143 when they came for columbus manor i didnt speak up because columbus manor was only one little school when they came for oak lawn i didnt speak up because oak lawn was only one little school district
921144 i pledge allegiance to the flag and my constitutional rights with which it comes
921145 and to the diversity in which our nation stands one nation part of one planet with liberty freedom choice and justice for all
921146 most oklahomans do not endorse the idea of killing innocent women and children in the name of ideology
921147 we do not condone suicide bombing any more than christians
921148 muslim youths are misguided into believing by the so called champions of the cause of islam that the current spate of killings and barbarisms which has no equal in the recent civilized history is jihad in the name of islam they are incited in the name of islam to commit heinous crimes not pardonable by any religion and strictly forbidden in islam even mosques and islamic institutions in the u s and around the world have become tools in hands and are used for collecting funds for their criminal acts
921149 wahhabi control over mosques means control of property buildings appointment of imams literature distributed in mosques organizational solicitations
921150 similar influence extends to prison and military chaplaincies islamic elementary and secondary schools academies college campus activity endowment of academic chairs and programs in middle east studies and most notoriously charities ostensibly helping muslims abroad many of which have been linked to or d esignated as sponsors of terrorism
921151 and he allah declared whoever is at war with my friends i declare war on them who is a friend of allah your true friend is allah the messenger and those who believe americans and canadians hear it well hear what im telling you the americans are not your friend hear what im telling you hear it well
921152 an appalling lack of awareness of religious history most religious communities have had zealots who have acted violently out of their take on their scriptures including our own christian community
921153 to purposefully condemn and denounce all oklahomans who are members of one religious body is just wrong whether they are muslim baptist or anything else
921154 muslims are one ummah community to the exclusion of all men believers are friends of one another to the exclusion of all outsiders
921155 if anyone disputes with you about jesus being divine flee them and pray allah will curse them
921156 those who reject islamic faith allah will not forgive them nor guide them to any path except the way to hell to dwell therein forever and this to allah is easy
921157 islamic terrorists are already in place in the u s and yes that includes bus drivers cafeteria workers and also airport workers
921158 jihad is noble fighting in allahs cause with full force and weaponry it is given the utmost importance in islam and is one of its pillars by jihad islam is established allahs word it made supreme and islam is propagated by abandoning jihad islam is destroyed and muslims fall into an inferior position their honor is lost their lands are stolen their rule and authority vanish jihad is obligatory duty in islam on every muslim he who tries to escape from this duty or does not fulfill this duty dies a hypocrite
921159 the content standards require that we present information about the rise of islam in the context of world history
921160 after careful consideration of the facts of our current situation
921161 i have decided to announce to everyone that i am no longer a citizen of the united states but a free and independent member of the global community
921162 was that the us kidnaps innocent people and takes them to cuba where they are kept indefinitely and tortured
921163 when it was written the declaration was considered an inflammatory document
921164 merciless indian savages whose known rule of warfare is an indistinguishable destruction of all ages sexes and conditions
921165 with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence notice all the capitols were they some kind of religious nuts or were they just showing off their penmanship
921166 i should say not if spanky and alfalfa had been told about alternative lifestyles in the 2 nd grade they wouldnt have wasted all those precious years on darla it was disgusting those little absurdities they lavished on her they could have spent more time with buckwheat and butch doing boy things in a virile sort of way besides gay marriage is legal in massachusetts and they teach it in the schools so there
921167 by presenting this kind of issue at such a young age theyre trying to indoctrinate our children theyre intentionally presenting this as a norm and its not a value that our family can support
921168 we couldnt run a school system if every parent who feels some topic is objectionable to them for moral or religious reasons their child should be removed from the class
921169 lexington is committed to teaching about the world they live in and in massachusetts same sex marriage is legal
921170 would you be comfortable having this story read to your children as part of their school curriculum
921171 but even second grade should to be exposed to all
921172 tomorrow were going to vote on the hate crimes bill and im sure that those of us in the senate to be there to vote for it
921173 my child is not old enough to understand something like that
921174 what might be inappropriate for one family in another family is a totally acceptable thing
921175 i will disown you i will adopt prince bertie i will say you are an imposter i will send you to lord chomsky to be reeducated you will rue the day you laid eyes on that wench
921176 our unalterable resolution would be to be free they have attempted to subdue us by force but god be praised in vain their arts may be more dangerous then their arms let us then renounce all treaty with them upon any score but that of total separation and under god trust our cause to our swords
921177 war is an ugly thing but not the ugliest of things the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks nothing worth a war is worse a man who has nothing which he cares more about than he does about his personal safety is a miserable creature who has no chance at being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself
921178 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
921179 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
921180 he loyally and steadfastly preaches the gospel but he doesnt shove it down our throats we get on well with david
921181 i have never felt self congratulatory in any way about my involvement because it did precipitate a conflict which eventually claimed 3 500 lives and that is inescapable
921182 it would be very cruel to say that what we have ended up with is a twilight home in east belfast for retired gunmen but are relations today between the communities really that different
921183 im just not convinced that the outcome we do have is any better than what we wouldve had had the march not went ahead
921184 the thought that this would lead to a re emergence of militant irish nationalism which would in turn bring about the resurgence of militant loyalism would simply never even have occurred to us
921185 what this was about and what it has returned to was equality of citizenship history will record the provisional iras campaign as a continuation of the civil rights movement by inappropriate means
921186 between the pomposity of bew and the extravagance of mccann i might look like the sane one
921187 there can be no viler act apart from homosexuality and sodomy than sexually abusing children
921188 a new duty will be placed on local authorities to promote democracy local leaders will be expected to do more to help residents understand how the democratic process works and how they can get involved residents can expect to see information campaigns and town halls being opened up to councillors to hold surgeries new civic champions council staff or former councillors who will go out into the community and work with residents and community groups to increase understanding about how they can raise awareness about civic roles they can take up whether thats volunteering standing as a governor a councillor or becoming a magistrate
921189 in our own informal way weve acted more as a critical friend than fawning acolyte or jaded oppositionalist
921190 wed like to highlight the good things that are happening right now in northern ireland and the awards will aim to reward effort and interactivity with a pat on the back from the blogosphere
921191 i have left the party and the press office as i feel that the current programme for government of the stormont administration will put working class communities under increased pressure at a time when the current global credit crunch is already hurting this vulnerable group in society i also feel that the partys left wing credentials have been damaged by the above and by a continued courtship with the american administration
921192 one of the bad things about the internet is that you pay attention to your commenters
921193 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
921194 yes its a rap about particle physics yes it mentions antimatter and the bbc report an
921195 criminal and anti social elements who are using this bonfire as a cover for other activities
921196 while the provincial man looks to the opinion of the metropolis the parochial is never in any doubt about the social and artistic validity of his parish
921197 these cases are due to come before the tribunals and will be strenuously defended by ofmdfm in the circumstances it would be inappropriate to comment further
921198 the vloggies honor the involvement of the videoblogging community of creators toolsmiths delivery platforms and viewers culminating in one real time real world evening event the awards will be announced on november 4th in san francisco california the evening will be podcast for anytime anywhere viewing through podtech net and itunes
921199 the olympics have been a big part of my life since i was about 14 and started showing some talent

921201 the team at the moment is the most balanced team weve had since the 60s
921202 alicias been at it for a while so all these years of hard work have paid off
921203 its just awesome to see a youngster take a great opportunity when it presents itself

921208 i am always away the most i have been home is three weeks you see a lot of the world

921210 i want them to know we dont want to just get rid of them without providing an alternative
921211 we dont want to move the problem from one location to another
921212 i said to him you cant sit around doing nothing the summer sport was either cricket or baseball and he chose baseball
921213 the students i met with today demonstrated an excellent understanding of the law in queensland
921214 it is important for students who will soon leave school and be important members of society to understand the legal structure we rely so much upon
921215 we discussed the change in the law which now makes the assault of a public servant an automatic serious assault
921216 we also talked about recent changes to the criminal code including the introduction of a new law of abandoning children and the removal of some provisions relating to piracy and duels
921217 who better to talk to our students about the world of law than queenslands top law maker the attorney general
921218 i was very impressed with some of the questions the students had for the attorney and they clearly understood the legal issues and how they relate to young people
921219 who knows some of the students i am visiting may one day become queenslands chief justice of the supreme court or even the director of public prosecutions
921220 i believe it is vital that those who want to become lawyers or barristers gain an early understanding of the law and that is what my visit to cleveland state high school is all about
921221 there are 831 registered jps in the cleveland electorate including the many who generously commit their own time to operate jp in the community sites such as the one at cleveland court house
921222 court processes are unfamiliar to most people and as a result many people can feel overwhelmed and intimidated
921223 it might force the closure of one of the most important outdoor camps in queensland
921224 im tremendously disappointed and i think the decision is not based on accurate information
921225 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
921226 stupid black men how to play the race card and lose

921228 colorados teachers have a right to know what their leaders are doing when they involve their unions in politics
921229 the criticism aired tuesday on dobsons focus on the family radio program comes shortly after an obama aide suggested a meeting at the organizations

921232 its really really really really exciting when im in the doctors office
921233 i want to do a show thats funny and where people can win something
921234 if someone who listens to howard stern happens to turn to the catholic channel one day and doesnt realize for a couple of minutes that what hes listening
921235 sports radio is partly about news but partly about entertainment
921236 and if what people are talking about is unc basketball players jumping off
921237 he earned a loyal following with incisive radio and television broadcasts he was a gifted speechwriter who served in my fathers administration
921238 a mother gave her children sops fables to read in the hope of educating and improving their minds but they very soon brought the book back and the eldest wise beyond his years delivered himself as follows

921364 i would like to apologise to both the parents and family of heidi murphy for what i have done which caused her death
921365 my intention was only to steal because i was pushed by economic needs and the result of that burglary was meant to buy a ring and to fund my marriage
921366 i did that because both of my parents could not afford to give me this and i didnt expect at all that the incident would be something like this
921367 by gods name i didnt have any intention to do this
921368 in this criminal case the defendant clearly had no intention and purpose to kill so that sentence demanded by the prosecutor is unacceptable
921369 i admit to all my mistakes and i realise that my action has violated law which the consequence is jail for me
921370 i surrender mr judge even though it feels so heavy the punishment that i must bear because im aware that this is definitely not as sad as has been felt by both parents and the family of heidi murphy for losing the person they loved
921371 im also aware that my action has tainted and slander bali image as tourist destination
921372 please honorary judges consider being a little bit more lenient with me so that i can have the chance to improve my life and so that i can do good deeds to others for now and for the future
921373 i also beg and ask for the greatest forgiveness from the parents and family of heidi murphy who have lost their most loving daughter
921374 i also offer an apology to my own parents for causing this very deep pain
921375 i didnt know anything about the murder i only knew about the burglary
921376 i would like to apologise to both the parents and family of heidi murphy for what i have done which caused her death

921382 we are sending out requests today to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games
921383 we are also urging video game arcades to pull the games from service
921384 we are committed to supporting family life and stability and commitment in relationships precisely because the secure start in life a stable family background provides is the best guarantee of maximising opportunity
921385 helping adults commit and stay committed not only opens the door to a depth of emotional enrichment which a series of shallow and hedonistic encounters can never generate it also provides the best possible start in life for children
921386 helping families under pressure especially those under economic pressure to commit and stay committed is one of the most effective anti poverty pro opportunity pro equality steps one could take
921387 i believe we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males
921388 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
921389 we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
921390 the relationship between these titles and their readers is a relationship in which the rest of us have an interest
921391 the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
921392 the contrast with the work done by womens magazines and their publishers to address their readers in a mature and responsible fashion is striking
921393 i think that we need to do much more to ensure that fathers play their full part in the lives of their children
921394 cultural signals and social norms do influence behaviour and the costs of relationship breakdown of children left fatherless of men behaving badly are borne by us all
921395 alongside a new emphasis on making sure the small minority of fathers who dont live up to their responsibilities are properly challenged there must also be greater support to help the overwhelming majority of men who are doing a brilliant job for their children
921396 its important that we see parenting as a shared responsibility with fathers playing an equal and complementary role to mothers those societies which help fathers play their full and equal role enjoy greater family stability as a result
921397 it is important also that we ensure fathers play the fullest possible role in those circumstances where relationships do break up

921443 that shows no clear leadership as a global reserve currency
921444 central banks continuing to aggressively reflate the economy will likely maintain pressure on currencies relative to gold and other hard assets this backdrop is complemented by emerging market countries that are facing energy and agriculture inflation which is expected to be positive for gold
921445 the seasonal slowdown for physical gold demand is nearly behind us and we expect increased demand looking ahead to august september and october with the us federal reserve rate cycle on hold for the time being the us dollar drifting and inflation pressures growing around the world particularly in the emerging market economies we believe the timing is right for investors to be buying gold and gold equities
921446 positive correlation between gold and the speculative futures position to continue and look for the long position to remain strong as gold consolidates and makes another run at 1 000 an ounce in september october 2008
921447 over the past 28 years gold has typically outperformed on a monthly basis in the months of april and may this is usually followed by a seasonal slowdown in the northern hemisphere summer months and an upsurge in the early fall with this in mind investors may be able to exploit near term weakness in gold and gold equities before a positive run in the late summer early fall period
921448 have emerged as a meaningful component of gold demand accounting for 7 of total demand in 2007 following a slowdown in mid 2007 the five primary etfs have added almost nine million ounces coincident with the gold price rally

921465 last autumn we made a mistake which was understandable but not excusable a shia prisoner ahmed al fartusi said he could put a stop to the killings we released 120 of their prisoners and withdrew out of town but when we moved out lawlessness took over as 90 per cent of the attacks were against us we thought if we moved out we would remove the source of the problem but actually the jaish al mahdi the mahdi army known to british troops as the jam had been fighting us because we were the only obstacle to their total control
921466 as if the problems were more about a few criminal tribes and families than religious groups baghdad thought basra was easy to solve and didnt fully understand the extent of the problem plus the americans with their obligations in mosul and elsewhere believed basra could look after itself it was compounded by having little guidance from above as to whether we were right to accept the deal

921582 if anybody asked me to plant grasses in those three places
921583 during the summer when temperatures and humidity are high and the grass is stressed by the heat the potential for disease development increases

921595 based on what im seeing today i think a new market would be good
921596 with that agreement i doubt that the project will move forward
921597 maybe people arent understanding the full ramifications of what these two deals can do to the city
921598 ive got to re evaluate the direction this city is looking to go and what direction we see it wanting to head
921599 it goes beyond just a new city market which on its own is just tremendous

921831 i just think the window we are in not that it is a bad idea i just dont think it is a good idea at this time

921841 lo escribo con optimismo y espero no equivocarme pues la noticia significa mucho especialmente para los guanajayenses el teatro vicente mora tiene esperanzas de salvarse un grupo de arquitectos y restauradores de la ciudad de berna suiza ha unido sus fuerzas con el centro nacional de conservaci n restauraci n y museolog a cencrem y en conjunto con el gobierno han manifestado su intenci n de contribuir a rescatar la obra
921842 chi disposto a barattare un po di libert con un po di sicurezza non avr ne luna ne laltra
921843 su una parte di questi provvedimenti il governo aveva chiesto il voto in campagna elettorale e in qualche misura erano attesi
921844 e una manovra depressiva perch non sostiene gli investimenti in un quadro di riduzione delle spese non fa selezione e insieme non sostiene i consumi perch non interviene sui redditi n dei pensionati n dei lavoratori
921845 male non servito per sostenere i consumi di lavoratori e pensionati e sono stati dati segnali di allentamento della morsa sulla lotta allevasione basti pensare alla sostituzione dei responsabili delle agenzie fiscali alle norme sulla tracciabilit e alla rimessa in discussione dei provvedimenti di damiano per far uscire dallillegalit il lavoro sommerso e irregolare
921846 la crisi c ma di fronte al suo aggravarsi il governo ha messo in campo tagli alla spesa molto pesanti come raramente si fatto nel passato tagli che saranno destinati a creare effetti negativi sulla sanit a partire dal 2009 e sui bilanci delle regioni e dei comuni per di pi questi tagli sono indiscriminati spalmati su tutti i settori non hanno un segno di selezione in questo quadro si rinuncia a fare qualsiasi operazione anticiclica e di sviluppo penso ai tagli alle infrastrutture e a quelli in ricerca innovazione e formazione
921847 siamo al paradosso nel nome di una giusta battaglia contro chi nel pubblico impiego fa il furbo e si intervenuti dautorit per tagliare le retribuzioni dei lavoratori e sottrarre fondi alla contrattazione di secondo livello dai musei agli ospedali
921848 male con questo tasso dinflazione il drenaggio fiscale opera un aumento del prelievo superiore di mezzo punto allanno per i lavoratori dipendenti e quindi inevitabile che il carico fiscale del lavoro dipendente sia destinato a crescere per questanno e per lanno prossimo
921849 il governo bravo a camuffare parla di robin hood e ingenera lidea che c attenzione ai pi deboli in realt avviene il contrario si parla di social card ma nessuno dice che i pensionati hanno avuto un aumento del1 6 per cento mentre abbiamo uninflazione al 4 per cento la manovra in realt finisce per allargare le diseguaglianze affronta il problema degli ultimi con misure di tipo compassionevole come la social card e colpisce i redditi medi e medio bassi
921850 il quadro negativo la crescita poco pi di zero e c un elenco che si allunga di aziende in difficolt la cassa integrazione alla fiat quella pi visibile in un paese come il nostro quando la fiat va in difficolt ne risente tutta leconomia anche da questo punto di vista lautunno sar socialmente molto delicato in pi posizioni come quelle assunte dal governo di fronte ai problemi della precariet fanno capire che in questo quadro economico anche la precariet pu essere destinata a crescere

921852 i had to sacrifice many things i am staying in bangalore from past three years and i havent gone to school i only go to school to give my exams i have stayed away from my home even but i knew in order to win an entry in olympic i have to make these sacrifices and i am happy with my decision
921853 he is our future hope hes just 16 years old and he has qualified in 3 4 events in the olympics which is great this is a land of cricket so we now hope that parents send their children for the olympic sports
921854 i thought the second puzzle was great but the work order puzzle relied on what i think of as an illegitimate approach the game world didnt really provide any knowledge although i may have missed something that would enable you to solve the work order unless you act in a way that contradicts the characters motives manny is desperate to get the order signed unless he already knows whats going on with don its not reasonable for him to go outside for the player who knows that there must be some solution to this problem leaving the building is reasonable but forcing the player to use that knowledge breaks the immersion
921855 el periodismo ciudadano no ha resultado exitoso a gran escala
921856 you couldnt really buy the times i had i left every day played here for nine years or something and im happy with that they deserve the money they have a short career
921857 i had a long career funnily enough people who come up to me even now and they say ah yeah youre the qpr man but they forget i played for 17 and a half years even nottingham forest the champions league as it is now they won twice but people dont remember me for that its just qpr
921858 but its very nice youve got to remember ive not played for getting on 27 years and the people still like me here i got on well with the crowd and they liked me and everything some of the players now as soon as theyve finished youve never heard of them again im lucky
921859 no i dont think so with all the new rules and things like that you could get away with murder in the old days people like ronnie harris and tommy smith at liverpool they punched you they kicked you but there wasnt that many cameras there then you got away with it you had to sort it out after the game not with tommy smith though he knew a few faces
921860 a lot of works been done on the ground and a lot of moneys been pumped into it lets hope they can get together a side as good as the one i played in
921861 i didnt realise quite how good our side was its just when i look back theyll be very lucky to get a team like that
921862 i know iain dowie very well because i was friends with him when he worked under gerry francis theyll be a very fit side thats for sure because hes really strong on that theyre favourites to win the league this year but ive not had a bet on them anyway theyll probably win it now
921863 the ground i think is 18 000 capacity theyre going to have to move its going to be a shame to lose this ground because of its history but theyre going to have to really
921864 the feeling i get from the new owners i think they will be a top four side maybe not here but when they move on
921865 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
921866 i put my heart and soul into the job but if i kept on going my career could have come to an abrupt end i think this decision will prolong my career
921867 i thought it might be time to go in new zealand where my body was working well but my mind was not working well i will always cherish the support ive had but this is a weight off my shoulders
921868 i had every ambition to lead the england team to the next ashes series but as england captain i feel ive run out of steam
921869 i believe that the best thing for the team is to embark on a new direction under a new captain
921870 i also believe the best thing for me is to try and get back to being best batsmen i can be ill still have all the experience and knowledge to pass on and i hope to be a valuable player for both my county and the england team
921871 id like to take this opportunity to thank all the fans who have always been so supportive and have provided a huge inspiration to me as captain a captain is only as good as his teams and ive been fortunate enough to captain some terrific players and great blokes
921872 hes led from the front and always led with integrity and honesty hes been the best possible ambassador for the england cricket team
921873 ive made the decision to step down as englands one day captain as i want to give myself the best chance to perform for england and enjoy my cricket
921874 whilst i am humbled to have been given the opportunity to captain englands one day side i feel the captaincy diminished my ability to perform for england across all forms of the game i feel the england captaincy impacted on my ability to enjoy my cricket and contribute to the team
921875 ive always enjoyed representing my country at the highest level
921876 and it has always been my ambition to play cricket across all forms of the game but ive found the extra workload of the captaincy to be very difficult
921877 the last thing i want is for the captaincy to impact my performance and that of the teams which is why ive arrived at this decision after a huge amount of consideration i will continue to make myself available to england for all forms of cricket and look forward to playing a significant role in englands future success
921878 paul feels this is the best decision in terms of benefiting the england team and his contribution to the team across all forms of the game
921879 we were very close to finalising modalities in agriculture and non agricultural market access
921880 a huge amount of problems which had remained intractable for years have found solutions
921881 to seriously reflect about if and when we can jump the obstacle of what was not possible this week
921882 this represents thousands of hours of negotiation and serious political investment by all the members of the wto
921883 most of the key issues of interest to the african continent were not even discussed
921884 africa critically needs to realise development and get itself out of poverty through the establishment of fair trade rather than aid
921885 africas opportunity to achieve fair trade has therefore been gravely undermined by the lack of progress in these negotiations
921886 the major developed members need to play in particular genuine leadership in the negotiations rather than in any unhelpful activities with a view to shifting responsibilities onto others including through the media
921887 some discrete parts of the package that have been negotiated or have almost been negotiated or where there is a consensus that i think you could move them forward
921888 the wto is not a buffet that you pick up what you want and go
921889 the bpk audit detected many fictitious building projects and nonexistent villages we will find out where the funds have gone
921890 hopefully all transactions related to the takeover can be completed by the end of this year
921891 this program will develop an alumni of senior police officers who will be able to share their knowledge with their counterparts in other regional police forces
921892 the jclec is a vital component of a joint policing effort to strengthen the capability and capacity of foreign law enforcement agencies to combat criminal threats that are increasingly borderless and multi jurisdictional
921893 if interest rates go up the real sector will stagnate bi must prioritize the peoples economy
921894 when african american youths and white youths were compared without regard to neighborhood context african american youths were more frequently and more seriously delinquent than white youths when african american youths did not live in underclass neighborhoods their delinquent behavior was similar to that of the white youths
921895 if twos company how many does it take to make a crowd
921896 tien had beaten his son many times before he forced him to drink rice wine which caused the boys death on july 22
921897 tiens wife used to be a prostitute so he thought the boy was not his son and he beat the boy every now and then
921898 a couple of days before the boy died his father had beaten him again and broken his arm
921899 ordinary cosmopolitanism in the global marketplace web based communities as sites of consumer resistance
921900 he had a hold of two of the balls through the bag he leaned over me trying to get the balls and forced me to my knees i buried the balls in my chest and bent over so he wouldnt get them
921901 newman just wanted to look at them just like anybody else
921902 wouldnt you want to see those balls i dont see why everyones making a big deal out of it a grown man a professional baseball player would do that isnt that a little ridiculous
921903 the oil companies need to know that there is a limit on how much profit they can take in this economy
921904 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
921905 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
921906 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
921907 even with the initial problems cuil was able to beat google in a key metric that measures relevancy of search results which is the amount of time a user spends on a site after being referred by a search engine
921908 its not like anybody feels that any of those guys being mentioned in either party has to get it
921909 maybe its hindsight playing tricks on me but it looks like the short lists in some years past contained people of greater stature
921910 one of the great strengths of this campaign from the very beginning has been the cohesion the sense of camaraderie and the lack of drama
921911 and one of the challenges moving forward is to expand and bring in more talent people from other campaigns and other places and still maintain that culture we began with i think its happening but its a process and it fights the normal physics of national politics
921912 specifically sought out people who are going to play by those rules
921913 i dont know that wed get t shirts made that say it but we take pride in not leaking we take pride in not being a typical campaign
921914 when all the layers got peeled back they were actually leaking
921915 there is a feeling now that were going to win this thing and people are starting to talk about who is going to be what a few months from now
921916 the small team atmosphere has changed and that has caused some frictions on the inside
921917 based on the way were all sitting you cant tell where everybody fits in the hierarchy and thats a good thing
921918 static caused by urgent sometimes vexing or even contradictory information played at too high a volume for too long
921919 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
921920 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
921921 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
921922 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
921923 anyone can make a baby but not everyone can be a parent
921924 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
921925 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
921926 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
921927 theyve taken a loophole in the law and with 15 people they have managed to establish themselves as a fringe party whose sole purpose is to confuse voters that democrats have support from a phantom party
921928 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
921929 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
921930 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
921931 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
921932 the idea that were going to offshore drill our way out of this is just so absurd as to not warrant consideration if youre in a hole stop digging
921933 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
921934 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
921935 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
921936 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
921937 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
921938 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
921939 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
921940 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
921941 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
921942 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
921943 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
921944 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
921945 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
921946 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
921947 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
921948 will attend a weekend meeting with irans chief nuclear negotiator the meeting is part of ongoing efforts to persuade iran to stop its nuclear program
921949 abba and pierce brosnan thats the best movie i have seen in a long time
921950 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
921951 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
921952 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
921953 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
921954 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
921955 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
921956 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
921957 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
921958 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
921959 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
921960 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
921961 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
921962 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
921963 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
921964 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
921965 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
921966 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
921967 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
921968 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
921969 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
921970 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
921971 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
921972 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
921973 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
921974 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
921975 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
921976 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
921977 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
921978 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
921979 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
921980 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
921981 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
921982 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
921983 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
921984 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
921985 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
921986 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
921987 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
921988 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
921989 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
921990 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
921991 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
921992 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
921993 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
921994 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
921995 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
921996 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
921997 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
921998 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
921999 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
922000 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
922001 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
922002 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
922003 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
922004 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
922005 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
922006 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
922007 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
922008 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
922009 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
922010 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
922011 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
922012 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
922013 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
922014 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
922015 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
922016 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
922017 im gonna get me so of that reward and shut that mans pie hole up once and for all
922018 i never heard a man moan so much about anything much less about global warming and the coming judgment day he done scared the hell out of my chickens now they dont lay as many eggs as before
922019 when im done thinking up something that will finally shut that man up i just know my chickens will be laying like the used to
922020 but for now theyll have to wear ear plugs you best get a pair too because its gonna be a long ten years of hearing that man talking without them
922021 gore new yorker cover way too far over the top
922022 a political promise to do something 40 years from now
922023 because everyone knows thats meaningless ten years is about the maximum time that we as a nation can hold a steady aim and hit the target
922024 are the very same measures needed to renew our economy
922025 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
922026 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
922027 in one month than an average american family uses in an entire year
922028 burned through enough electricity to power 232 average american households for a month
922029 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
922030 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
922031 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
922032 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
922033 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
922034 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
922035 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
922036 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
922037 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
922038 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
922039 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
922040 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
922041 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
922042 weve tried to maximize the use of these moments with our founder and chairman al gore so that we can continue the momentum not just for our campaign but to keep the cause at the top of the news
922043 the challenge gore laid down today becomes a focal point and a rallying call for pr efforts around the campaign it gives our grassroots effort something to rally around
922044 these national conversations about oil prices energy and what are people going to do the idea to drill more as a solution thats the reason we needed to do this today to start to put a different framework around the issues
922045 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
922046 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
922047 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
922048 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
922049 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
922050 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
922051 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
922052 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
922053 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
922054 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
922055 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
922056 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
922057 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
922058 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
922059 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
922060 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
922061 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
922062 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
922063 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
922064 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
922065 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
922066 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
922067 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
922068 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
922069 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
922070 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
922071 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
922072 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
922073 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
922074 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
922075 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
922076 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
922077 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
922078 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
922079 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
922080 i choose to reach across the aisle with john kerry to protect homeowners against foreclosure
922081 kerry advocates all kinds of additional socialism at home appeasement abroad and what that means is weakness for the future
922082 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
922083 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
922084 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
922085 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
922086 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
922087 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
922088 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
922089 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
922090 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
922091 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
922092 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
922093 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
922094 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
922095 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
922096 can you please tell me what the lottery numbers will be in the next drawing
922097 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
922098 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
922099 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
922100 i heard people say that they didnt have a right to vote from abroad
922101 a vote is a vote regardless of where you are for anyone who says they dont have a right to vote you do
922102 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
922103 i do think theres an opportunity for us to shine a light on some of those questions
922104 i think youll see that we will answer the call
922105 when theres news we will deal with the issues as they come
922106 we arent going to go there as the guests of the chinese government and deliberately poke sharp sticks in their eyes
922107 were not going to go out of our way to do it but we think there are going to be a lot of opportunities to bring the subject up based on the events of the day
922108 we are iraqis and you shouldnt say such a thing
922109 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
922110 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
922111 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
922112 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
922113 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
922114 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
922115 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
922116 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
922117 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
922118 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
922119 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
922120 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
922121 we have seen the books but they are incomplete and so we dont believe they are accurate
922122 accounting is problematic owing to the point blank refusal of the former head of administration to account for large amounts of expenditure
922123 the party leader has sole control of and responsibility for administration and finances
922124 overall income fell by over 100 000 from 726 455 to just 611 274 distinctly odd in a party clebrating a 56 membership increase
922125 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
922126 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
922127 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
922128 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
922129 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
922130 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
922131 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
922132 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
922133 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
922134 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
922135 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
922136 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
922137 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
922138 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
922139 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
922140 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
922141 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
922142 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
922143 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
922144 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
922145 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
922146 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
922147 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
922148 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
922149 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
922150 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
922151 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
922152 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
922153 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
922154 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
922155 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
922156 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
922157 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
922158 the message that needs to be communicated to these people is your problem is not global warming
922159 your problem is not global warming your problem is your nuts
922160 theyre going to the gore movie an inconvenient truth and being fed all this its ridiculous
922161 well look back on all of this in 10 or 15 years and realise how foolish it was
922162 the human impact on the atmosphere is simply too small to have a major effect on global temperatures
922163 it bothers me that my fellow scientists are not speaking out against something they know is wrong
922164 but they also know that theyd never get any grants if they spoke out i dont care about grants
922165 this is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back to where we were in 1930
922166 human rights activists everywhere to condemn this violation of mr juarezs civil rights child rape is one of the basic civil rights guaranteed by the un civil rights commission
922167 the united states our future colony refuses to recognize that child rape is an important part of our superior mexican culture
922168 mr juarez is missing work at the factory farm of one of my big campaign contributors so i have asked president bush to pardon him so he can get back to work where he belongs he will be whipped for missing work while he was fooling around with that girl
922169 because we say so since we duke professors are smarter than anyone we know
922170 mr juarez is doing the kind of raping that americans wont do we have many 10 year old girls in the us but not enough skilled us rapists my proposed legislation will grant mr juarez full citizenship upon payment of a fine of 50 00 payable to the republican national congressional committee which desperately needs the money if mr juarez doesnt have enough money to pay the fine he should go rob someone
922171 if she had taken the ride in my car that i offered her she would not have been home to be raped by this future democrat voter we offer him sanctuary in massatwochits hic
922172 the girls family didnt buy carbon rights i bought from a chinese farmer who promised not to burn a million tons of coal this year so there was a cyclone which caused this rape
922173 conservatives say that we just need to focus on maintaining free markets and let everything sort itself out through the miracle of the invisible hand but the political tide is turning against unfettered free markets and toward greater regulation
922174 this is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back to where we were in 1930
922175 a dog takes a lot of training and a person has to be with them all of the time
922176 a dog doesnt work seven days a week and maybe will get into a bad mood
922177 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
922178 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
922179 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
922180 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
922181 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
922182 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
922183 this is like having a personal assistant for your memory
922184 our daily routines are overflowing with situations where we gain new information through meetings advertisements conferences events surfing the web or even window shopping instead of going home and using a general web search to find that information pensieve helps the brain recall those everyday things you might normally forget
922185 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
922186 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
922187 you know its not about you its about your country

922192 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
922193 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
922194 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
922195 but i resent when you throw out stupid allegations that have no merit and really no purpose other than to inflame

922198 cleve youre wrong chet was back there behind the rail and i was standing by him when he answered his answer just wasnt heard
922199 you have a talent for leadership bob the country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation
922200 after about a year i became disinterested quit paying my dues and dropped my membership in the organization during the nine years that have followed i have never been interested in the klan
922201 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia and in every state in the nation

922209 i would never fight in the armed forces with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels

922274 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
922275 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
922276 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
922277 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over

922292 it is good to get off to a good start
922293 the boys have performed well and it is good to come in and get off to a winning start
922294 it has been a bit of rollercoaster to be fair
922295 i think i signed on thursday then got my first bit of football in training and straight into a tournament situation it was really good for me
922296 i was working hard on my own at blackburn and the people at blackburn helped me out and kept me fit

922298 the talent is here you can see it on display the players are here as well it is a good set up and lets hope this season can be a good one
922299 all the claims of bjp leaders have been proved wrong

922304 it was an attack on the friendship between india and afghanistan we will fight it unitedly and with determination
922305 scolari said nothing to me when i was with portugal but this is significant as it means the work i have been doing at atletico is positive
922306 on an average on a daily basis cancellation as affected about ten rooms so on an average about a lakh a day has been lost for the last five to seven days i dont think you can take it as a loss it is postponement of this kind of a business of source ome might not come but a majority of them will come back
922307 i want to stay and prove i can cut it in the premier league
922308 its not happening at the moment so ill probably knock the offer on the head
922309 as i looked to exit the video plug in business to fully concentrate on our photography photoshop products i approached red giant software to help ease the transition for our users
922310 this is an exciting milestone for our company we entered the plug in market nearly six years ago and we are now are one of the largest providers of tools to production professionals we are dedicated to providing innovative tools for broadcasters film designers and independent filmmakers and digital anarchy s video toolset expands our palette we look forward to providing digital anarchy film video users and future customers with the best support and on going updates to these new tools and we re already working on updates and compatibility enhancements
922311 i was never interested in reality shows or dance shows as they have become so common moreover i was never keen on taking up siddharths show and never said yes to him i actually asked them to let me think about it
922312 i had never made any commitments to them but its true that at one stage i thought of doing it because it sounded at least different from playing a weepy daughter in law
922313 it was rude on shilpas part not to attend the awards function
922314 the news report is completely false and baseless there are no such plans
922315 im excited by the new season of course i am
922316 i had to sacrifice many things i am staying in bangalore from past three years and i havent gone to school i only go to school to give my exams i have stayed away from my home even but i knew in order to win an entry in olympic i have to make these sacrifices and i am happy with my decision

922318 we have incurred loss of crores since shrine board agitation before this even we had incurred losses our trucks were loaded with pear and apples were looted in samba vijaypur and udhampur
922319 i had apples and pear loaded in my truck but i had to return back half way the owner of the fruits was even shocked that i had returned with the fruits and every thing is rotten i left three days ago but no one allowed us to cross lakhanpur
922320 we are incurring a loss of crores daily the growers have to either sell their land or commit suicide
922321 the cause of this can without doubt be attributed to traffic shaping the practice of prioritising one type of traffic over another
922322 this suggests that the policy is applied universally regardless of product and regardless of usage volume
922323 on bt were seeing http traffic running at very high speeds but other p2p port ranges see massive dips at peak hours
922324 this traffic shaping helps its http tests to perform so well
922325 the 2mb sec and 4mb sec products maintain their full speed consistently and the 10mbps product does a good job too apart from the occasional dip
922326 the 20mb sec product is where the issue lays with significant dips seen every evening
922327 significant variation was seen between individual 20mb sec lines with many running at 20mb sec during off peak hours but some dipped down to below 10mb sec
922328 the 20mb sec product doesnt come close to 20mb sec on average

922338 my job is to call balls and strikes not pitch or bat
922339 a discourse on roe v wade and a challenge to law professors this fall
922340 if any law student or a practitioner of law objectively reads roe v wade the opinion must surely seem like a proclamation from planet bizarro world the opinion is unlike all other legal opinions that law students study in school and that lawyers encounter in practice it suffers from next to no analysis of legal precedent it contains no examination of the constitution or of legislative intent
922341 may force upon the woman a distressful life and future
922342 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights at among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
922343 since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts their consciences also bearing witness and their thoughts now accusing now even defending them
922344 however rude it may be these days to say so there are some moral truths that we all really know truths which a normal human being is unable not to know they are universal possession an emblem of rational mind and heirloom of the family of man

922351 the daily movement of our life is choreographed by the music in our head
922352 our strategies for dealing with teenage pregnancy need to be focused more on young men and their responsibilities
922353 thats why i believe we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males

922365 democrats are in favor of the largest tax increase in american history
922366 the virginia republican party which dominated the state just a few years ago has placed the raw pursuit of power over its principles and in the process has lost both power and principles it will not return to power until it returns to principled conservatism

922375 as i looked to exit the video plug in business to fully concentrate on our photography photoshop products i approached red giant software to help ease the transition for our users red giant software is recognized in the industry for taking care of its customers with a solid record for support and marketing it was important to find digital anarchys film video users a good new home red giant software fits that bill

922421 it is sensible for the states to reach as much of an amicable consensus on non smoker protection as possible and to prevent a patchwork of regulations across the country

922433 these are very complex molecular signals and the authors have very nicely shown that there is one molecule laminins 511 that is a very important signal to tell the hair molecule to move through the process its part of a basic biological understanding
922434 mice are not just little men and women they are different than us and also different in their hair
922435 so laminin 511 is an early epithelial message to the dermis to say lets start producing hair
922436 hair is formed as a result of cooperation and communication between the two layers
922437 we knew that the two layers of the skin are important in hair formation and we knew that there was some early epithelial signal hypothesized a long time ago but no one knew what it was until now
922438 the hair follicles are still there but they get stuck in the cycle so its not well understood why theyre stuck and how do you get them unstuck
922439 the hope of course is that you can apply this to humans but there are some cautions in all that biology is very complex there are a lot of checks and balances you dont want hair follicles and cells in hair follicles to be growing too much or not enough the on and off signals that are dampening that and controlling that are very very complex and not well understood this is far far from humans

922446 theres something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays camping trips with my dad and stepmother and my very large family
922447 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to
922448 people who are not afraid to stick their neck out people who are not afraid to stand up for things and be unpopular to go against the grain think outside the box

922450 what are you going to do for the public schools
922451 we are increasing a plants efficiency for water uptake plants that can sense water in a better fashion will be higher in economic value in the future
922452 we are developing plants that are more efficient in sensing water
922453 the idea was to measure which levels of weight support and speeds give us the best combination of aerobic workout while reducing the impact on joints
922454 we showed that a person can run faster in the g trainer at a lower weight and still get substantial aerobic benefits while maintaining good neuromuscular coordination
922455 if you can decrease the intensity of these peak forces during running then you probably will decrease the risk of injury to the runner
922456 it might be important for the parasite to know when the host is flowering so it can flower at the same time
922457 were trying to figure out the plane of division when cells are placed in oddly shaped chambers
922458 is it in the same place or way off the middle
922459 the figure is still quite impressive and i estimate this will rise substantially in the next few years
922460 china has become a notable factor in the scientific landscape usually scientific development in nations does not show such a strong acceleration as we have seen in china so it will be interesting to see how it responds and develops in the future
922461 the china gt move over us china to be new driver of worlds economy and innovation
922462 with this new contrast medium we were able to visualize five to ten times more foci of inflammation in comparison to conventional mri images and contrast media
922463 ms is the most frequent cause of occupational disability and handicap in young adults
922464 new therapies have a positive influence on the course of the disease but are often not initiated at early stages since the diagnosis of ms is not yet established
922465 methadone kills sensitive leukemia cells and also breaks treatment resistance but without any toxic effects on non leukemic blood cells
922466 we find this very exciting because once conventional treatments have failed a patient which occurs in old and also in young patients they have no other options
922467 addiction shouldnt be an unsolvable problem if methadone is ever used as an anti cancer therapy
922468 weve found that cb1 expression is lost in most colorectal cancers and when that happens a cancer promoting protein is free to inhibit cell death
922469 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy
922470 turning cb1 back on and then treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention
922471 people have looked at cannabinoids in cancer earlier mainly in cell culture experiments
922472 the molecular mechanisms for loss of the receptor and its effect on cancer have not been previously shown
922473 just increasing the levels of cannabinoids to treat colorectal cancer wont work if the cb1 receptor is not present
922474 this suggests that the flu vaccine doesnt protect seniors as much as has been thought
922475 ours is by far the largest case control study of flu vaccine in the elderly
922476 we tried to overcome the limits of previous studies done by others
922477 those studies may have over estimated the benefits of the flu vaccine in the elderly for various reasons
922478 thats why our study used a control time period after flu vaccine became available but before each flu season actually started
922479 because those who got the vaccine happened to be healthier not because the flu vaccine was protecting them from pneumonia caused by the flu since it wasnt present yet
922480 despite our findings and even though immune responses are known to decline with age i still want my grandmother to keep getting the flu vaccine
922481 the flu vaccine is safe so it seems worth getting even if it might lower the risk of pneumonia and death only slightly
922482 people age 65 and older should still get yearly flu vaccines as usual
922483 at a time when bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to many of our best antibiotics it is an extremely bad idea to risk undermining gentamicins effectiveness for treating human disease by using it to treat a disease in apples
922484 the threat of antibiotic resistance is growing and the number of effective antibiotics is dwindling
922485 our priority must be to save these effective antibiotics for whom they are needed most for humans not for agriculture
922486 final analysis of the data for this discovery was done by a thoroughly international team of researchers including scientists of american belgian british georgian italian and russian nationalities
922487 they worked closely and productively together to achieve this challenging and exciting experimental result
922488 treatment with a potentially cardiotoxic drug may often be inevitable to extend survival for a cancer patient however it is essential to be aware of the risk of cardiotoxicity not only because cardiotoxicity can progress to a potentially fatal out come if not treated but also because it lowers the quality of patient life
922489 if we can better predict who is at greatest risk for toxicity and who is not we may be able to comfortably offer stan dard treatment to a larger percentage of the population
922490 we selected this environment to test our wimax solution because in a normal city or town you have plenty of communications channels such as umts telephony or adsl
922491 it is in extremely remote areas that it makes sense to use this wireless technology
922492 there are some coverage problems with the mobile version of wimax says martufi
922493 when you go indoors for example the coverage of mobile wimax decreases it would be interesting to develop a seamless connection allowing you to move from mobile wimax to your home network that uses wifi

922515 undeniably low maternal vitamin d affects the way the brain develops
922516 over the past four years weve been able to show that low vitamin d intake in animals during pregnancy results in offspring with brain abnormalities similar to those seen in patients with schizophrenia
922517 the danes are only able to give us 1 6 microlitres of plasma so weve had to come up with a method of determining the vitamin d levels in that tiny amount of blood
922518 in collaboration with alun jones at the institute of molecular bioscience weve developed a way to easily measure low levels of vitamin d using mass spectrometry
922519 if we establish the link in this huge patient cohort we will be able to show that having low maternal vitamin d does not necessarily mean a child is going to develop schizophrenia but if a child has a particularly vulnerable genome the low maternal vitamin d may be the environmental trigger
922520 its the combination of gene and environment which triggers the disease
922521 what weve found with miscanthus is that the amount of biomass generated each year would allow us to produce about 2 1 2 times the amount of ethanol we can produce per acre of corn
922522 it wasnt that we didnt know how to grow switchgrass because the yields we obtained were actually equal to the best yields that had been obtained elsewhere with switchgrass
922523 one reason why miscanthus yields more biomass than corn is that it produces green leaves about six weeks earlier in the growing season
922524 one of the criticisms of using any biomass as a biofuel source is it has been claimed that plants are not very efficient about 0 1 percent efficiency of conversion of sunlight into biomass
922525 what we show here is on average miscanthus is in fact about 1 percent efficient so about 1 percent of sunlight ends up as biomass
922526 keep in mind that when we consider our energy use a few hours of solar energy falling on the earth are equal to all the energy that people use over a whole year so you dont really need that high an efficiency to be able to capture that in plant material and make use of it as a biofuel source
922527 our highest productivity is actually occurring in the south on the poorest soils in the state
922528 so that also shows us that this type of crop may be very good for marginal land or land that is not even being used for crop production
922529 in the context of global change thats important because it means that by producing a biofuel on that land youre taking carbon out of the atmosphere and putting it into the soil
922530 keep in mind that this miscanthus is completely unimproved so if we were to do the sorts of things that weve managed to do with corn where weve increased its yield threefold over the last 50 years then its not unreal to think that we could use even less than 10 percent of the available agricultural land
922531 and if you can actually grow it on non cropland that would be even better
922532 we propose a scenario in which standard treatments such as neurosurgery and stereotactic radiosurgery are used to treat clinical metastases and currently unavailable molecular therapeutics are then used to hold the remaining micrometastases in check one possible molecular therapeutic is lapatinib a dual inhibitor of egfr and her2 kinases

922536 to try to suppress nationhood and concentrate power at the centre of a european conglomerate would be highly damaging we certainly do not need new regulations which raise the cost of employment and make europes labour market less flexible and less competitive with overseas suppliers and certainly we in britain would fight attempts to introduce collectivism and corporatism at the european level although what people wish to do in their own countries is a matter for them

922600 i came to work for an israeli businessman he has a big company that he wanted me to work for after a year we thought there was a good potential in the food business so i contacted a friend in israel he is one of my partners and we started with a small coffee place with two local partners but we didnt get a long too well so we went our separate ways and we sold our part the next thing we got another local partner and another partner from holland who is a silent investor and the four of us established this company and now we have this bistro and now we have the bakery and another sandwich bar in the eu building this concept is very similar to what we have back home that is why we did it this looks very similar to places in tel aviv
922601 i notice that a lot of places in prishtina remind me of tel aviv
922602 people like it they come to speak to us they want to be in contact here i didnt see anybody that was negative on the contrary the people are very warm very nice they take islam to a beautiful place not a violent place when they hear i am from israel they react very warmly
922603 kosovars used to identify with the palestinians because we albanians are muslims and christians and we saw serbia and israel both as usurpers of land
922604 then we looked at a map and woke up israelis have a population of six million their backs to the sea and 300 million arab enemies albanians have a total population of eight million our backs to the sea and 200 million slav enemies so why should we identify with the arabs
922605 the conflict is not our problem we are muslims but not really we have respect for israelis because of the u s i have good friends from there
922606 albanians everywhere are aware that jews want to help them in this conflict
922607 and jews are aware and thankful to albanians for saving their lives during the second world war so we have our sympathy for israel i dont think the muslims here are on the side of the palestinians
922608 in albania and kosovo we are in support of israel i would never side with the muslim side to wipe israel off the face of the world 90 of kosovo feels this way the reason why is we sympathize a lot with the people who have suffered the same fate as us we were muslims even in the second world war stronger muslims than we are now but even then we protected them with our lives our grandfathers protected the jews wherever they were in the region
922609 they tell me that in the holocaust they used to keep the survivors inside of shelters
922610 and vice versa in 1999 the first plane that landed in prishtina for support was an israeli plane
922611 the plane was medical support and doctors and some security and they took refugees to israel i know some albanians who live to this day in israel
922612 they took them most of them came back here i have talked to more than five people already that lived between 1999 and 2001 in israel until everything was quiet here then they came back
922613 it is like when israel went to india when they had an earthquake
922614 they went to africa when there was a disaster in mombasa this is what israel does
922615 actually after the tsunami they wanted to send it to indonesia and they didnt let them because it was a muslim country but israel and kosovo have a very good relationship the prime minister visited israel a few months ago
922616 i think that a lot of people in the world think that the war in israel is a religious war
922617 i dont think it is a religious war i think it is totally about lands and the occupied territory and the religion is what leaders try to take advantage to promote their own interests like what yassin did with the suicide bombers and said they will go to heaven they try to make it a religious war but it is not it is about lands i have a lot of friends here and my girlfriend she is muslim i am very serious about her and to tell you honestly most of the israeli people are not religious people the last time i was in synagogue was when i was 13 years old i had to do the bar mitzvah and since then i havent gone if you go to tel aviv 98 percent of the people are super liberal and they will accept you if are a palestinian if you are chinese if you are jewish if things go well i want to bring my girlfriend back home to israel
922618 that the religion and the state are connected you need to be jewish to be an important citizen but now things are changing now we have civil marriage in specific places that are recognized in israel and she can get citizenship
922619 do you know about the wahhabis that are coming here
922620 there are people telling me that people from outside are coming here to try to make religion a bit stronger
922621 nobody has shown any kind of problems against israel on the contrary because everybody here loves the u s and they all know that israel is like a state of the u s that is a good thing everybody knows the support that israel gets from the u s you dont need to be well educated to know that the amount of money israel gets from the u s means israel owes them a lot and thats how it works when israelis wanted to do military business with china they had to cancel it because the u s didnt like it
922622 so you think the primary reason kosovars like israel is because of the united states
922623 i think it is many things they had good relations with the jewish people back in the old days if you go back 40 or 50 years you will find that there were good relations with the jewish people they lived here happily also i think it is what happened in 1999 that showed them that israel cares and wants to help them and the people who came back here from israel say that it was amazing and they are still in contact with the families in israel nobody here is radical it is a muslim country but i think it is a beautiful muslim country i think israel is a more religious country than here
922624 i was in a jewish meeting for all of the balkans about two years ago i usually dont go to these kind of meetings because i feel much more an israeli than a jew but i went because i used to work for this company and my colleague who was also israeli and was a bit more religious wanted company so i went to belgrade and novi sad but since then i havent visited i can tell you honestly i like it better here than in bosnia and serbia i dont know why maybe because i am living here and what happened i was a part of it i dont know
922625 it wont and thats the whole point religion can co exist for example my girlfriend you know i am in love above my head i want us to be together i dont think religion should i think the opposite i think religion should integrate
922626 im sure ill have to deflate it along with my high spirits when nini comes home after raphael i can just imagine what her reaction to this

922630 she was younger than vincent and a very kind very gentle individual
922631 like everyone else i think her response is surprise and shock all of us who had known the family i dont know that anyone could have seen this coming there was nothing predictable about it
922632 she is shocked and very much afraid as to what this is going to mean to her own life
922633 he seemed like a person who was happy to have a job was very committed to doing it well and really there was nothing that would cause him to stand out in any way
922634 ich habe darauf vertraut dass der cas eine gerechte l sung findet

922637 nature has endowed this carnivore with more than enough bite force to kill and eat large and potentially dangerous prey
922638 pound for pound the great whites bite is not particularly impressive but the sheer size of the animal means that in absolute terms it tops the scales it must also be remembered that its extremely sharp serrated teeth require relatively little force to drive them through thick skin fat and muscle
922639 why stop at a top rate of 455 pounds why not go further
922640 there is perhaps a danger that the proposed changes are large enough to be noticed but not large enough to change behaviour
922641 if climate change really is as important and urgent as the government frequently and rightly acknowledges then it would suggest there is a strong and defensible case for much more penal taxes on high emissions cars

922645 they see newcastle as a massive club with vast potential
922646 they know they already attract 50 000 plus crowds and wonder what would happen if they get back into the champions league but they also see india as an untapped market as well
922647 its high time he spoke out to clarify the situation
922648 if he wants to stay and turn newcastle into a successful club then thats great and he should come out and say something sooner rather than later the same applies if he has decided he wants to sell up
922649 there is no limit on the amount of sewage that can come out of these overflows they represent a licence to pollute
922650 it is imperative that we have good water quality for our marine life and for tourism and swimmers everyone needs to see clean beaches
922651 northern ireland prides itself on its wonderful scenery and nice environment but its a contradiction if its not as clean and wonderful as it should be
922652 we dont believe its a crime to meet with others to try to find solutions to the gravest threat that humanity has faced in recent times
922653 equipment we seized suggests some protesters were clearly intent on unlawful action

922655 weve eliminated some planes and were narrowing it down we are looking at aircraft other than the md 80s
922656 i love boeing 737s and i think theyre great planes but that doesnt necessarily mean that were going there
922657 there are a number of planes out there that could work for us and that has changed over the past six months
922658 were doing what we need to do to make this work and well be coming out of the woodwork with an announcement

922661 the airline will maintain a low cost carrier structure while selling items of value to consumers that do not increase the overall cost per available seat mile
922662 if someone is going to save the bay these are the kind of people they need to bring in
922663 its high time they brought someone like bonnie brooks to head the organization
922664 we think there is a void between holt renfrew and the bay
922665 we have a lot of work to do we are going to bring in world class management
922666 she has revitalized the stores physically and stocked them with prestige brands shes very skilled at putting together a merchandising mix of the right brands
922667 bonnie brooks is one of those talented strong go getters
922668 theyre really trying to make this work theyre developing a very senior talented executive which is encouraging
922669 the times demand a radical new phase new labour won three elections by offering real change not just in policy but in the way we do politics we must do so again
922670 i would have sacked him i think hes been grossly disloyal
922671 we continue to believe that the current decline in share price is a great entry opportunity to one of canadas strongest retail brands
922672 we believe tim hortons as a value based quick service restaurant with a dominant brand in canada should outperform other food service operators in the current environment
922673 unfortunately tim hortonss withdrawal of its hot beef sandwich after little more than a quarter of sales is also a painful reminder that competitive products and timing can thwart well conceived plans
922674 i have carried down both living and dead people from the mountain
922675 i panicked when a pakistani fell straight onto my back with his entire weight i was terrified that he would pull us all off the cliff and screamed to him to use his ice axe but he lost his grip and plummeted off a 300 metre cliff
922676 at present it is believed that anyone who is classified as position unknown will not be coming back
922677 mr mcdonnell was one of the strongest climbers in the world and it is with great sadness that we now have to mourn his passing
922678 expeditions had been waiting at base camp for up to two months for good weather
922679 these are big mountains and are dangerous at any time they take their toll every year mountaineering is a calculated risk
922680 many people buy these packages to k2 and especially to everest
922681 they are certainly strong people but they do not have enough experience to react they dont know how to behave in the case of emergencies in the case of missing ropes in the case of bad weather
922682 weve got some momentum going particularly since the prime minister met with president hu hintao at the g8 in japan
922683 weve got a trajectory of diplomatic and other kinds of activities that we are laying out in front of us and i look forward to starting to put that together
922684 i think that the relationship with china is one that weve been cultivating and improving for some time now and my appointment certainly does not get in the way of that but i dont think its a signal of any profound change in foreign policy
922685 emerson is well respected he may well represent the prime ministers voice on this front
922686 as important as he is now as foreign minister probably the most respected senior minister now in all the harper governments but still it is not enough when it comes to china
922687 you need to have the prime ministers direct engagement that is where the key problem is
922688 harper is not committing to visiting china any time soon
922689 why everybody else other heads of state of g8 are visiting china are engaging china for improving chinas human rights for improving economic relations to promote jobs and investments and our prime minister is not doing so
922690 ive believed for a long time in my discussions with the prime minister and he agrees youve got to engage china
922691 weve got issues around human rights rule of law and those kinds of issues youve got to find a way to ensure that we can continue to promote those issues with greatest effect
922692 we have to manage the relationship and thats certainly going to be a top priority for me
922693 i dont intend to be pushing for any great lurching of canadian policy without having done an extremely careful in depth analysis of the gordian knot of all of the related issues
922694 we have strengthened security in all olympic venues and in the olympic village
922695 this is not about transcanada dreaming up the project we think will work its about the five key parties getting together and crafting something here
922696 people were allowed to walk through kids were hanging out
922697 the cops have this serious need to stop anyone from taking photos
922698 it would be a little ridiculous and funny if it was not so sinister
922699 ive been a thorn in their side for quite some time they thought id just drop by the wayside

922799 la coppia funziona perch porta esperienza mirko andato bene pure con tonetto ma le catene nel senso di coppie a prescindere dalle individualit portano vantaggi a una squadra
922800 certo mirko pu giocare anche da centravanti prtendo dal lato pi pungente parte e taglia non per questo rinuncio a un altro esterno ne servono due se io uso vucinic in un momento in cui in calo penalizzo la squadra e magari perdo una partita i devo avere la isera del titolare ed essere bravo a utilizzarli nel giorno giusto a sinistra ne ho uno e a destra con taddei fuori nessuno esposito c ma non ha le caratteristiche di un giocatore abituato ai rientri
922801 stessi pregi e stessi difetti vero noi siamo quelli dellanno scorso e anche per questo dobbiamo scegliere i rinforzi giusti va completato lorganico numericamente con giocatori che non siano diversi da quelli che abbiamo simili tanto che io li possa mettere sullo stesso piano ci chi qui sulla prima punta possiamo anche essere daccordo ma ho vucinic oltre totti e montella lui in questo periodo soffre pi di tutti per il lavoro che facciamo fatica nelle corse lughe un gol come quello di montecarlo quando in condizione non lo sbaglia mai
922802 di sicuro prenderemo due giocatori forti magari poi ne pu anche partire uno saremo competitivi solo con giocatori dello stesso livello proprio per sopperire ai cali di tensione e individuali avuti in passato

922861 there is a growing need for workers who have to deal constantly with the public to manage emotions and this is especially true for those on the phones
922862 when we think about call center workers one of the biggest challenges is remaining resilient to the anger and hostility that can come their way thats the negative side
922863 but what about the positive side if a client is pleasant and cheerful does that infuse you with energy in the way i found it does when a positive mood from home spills over
922864 what we really heard in the calls we listened to and in focus groups was that there is a wide variety of emotions from very negative hostile ones to very sad ones
922865 i found there was more evidence of enrichment where positive emotions from home spilled over and caused people to be more engaged with work negative emotions also spilled over and caused people to be more engaged with their work employers fear spillover from home will cause workers to be disengaged but people try to escape from a negative experience by throwing themselves into another role
922866 my guess is employees are skilled and able to segment that away from themselves but they let in the positive if the customer is cheerful and happy perhaps its a coping mechanism
922867 in the command and control model in essence you set it up so that the customer has to get angry or upset with you before his or her issues can get resolved youre signaling to the customer that talking loudly and screaming gets you what you want
922868 only a small percentage of these workers are in a union with technology a flick of a switch can move their jobs away workers say that they are afraid to complain
922869 if we focus on understanding the job and build a selection system we want to start with the biggest impact and build on that
922870 i think it makes a great deal of difference what product people are supporting
922871 the danger is you have people with great courtesy and presentation on the phone and they give bad information all the time
922872 why dont we do the same thing for the selection process we probably know the manager that consistently makes the best quality hires we should and we can measure that
922873 vendors promote their product on instantaneous results and an easy to read and easy to interpret report great now i can make a bad decision faster and easier
922874 its very costly anything over 5 is pain and ive seen it where the mean is 17 days
922875 on the other hand a misfit at the claim center may have an entrepreneurial spirit theyre not going to be happy campers they wont commit to the organization and they will soon leave
922876 in the business world a lot of people assume they know fit and talk about fit but they really dont put a lot of rigor around it
922877 the moral of the tale is that in an applied sense the person organization fit was a significant predictor of turnover
922878 we see that scripting builds skills and managers have a reason to want them but there is a downside
922879 more scripting is associated with lower job satisfaction greater burnout and a higher intention to quit the job
922880 if you can do that i suggest you will cut turnover and increase efficiency where people dont think scripts are going to reduce their autonomy where they have the big picture they are less likely to be burned out and less likely to quit
922881 helping people understand why they are doing these kinds of things is critical in helping them to survive what can be a really stressful environment
922882 there are members from all 500 of the fortune 500 companies linkedin members comprise 130 different industries and include 130 000 recruiters
922883 by building authentic relationships virtually as well as face to face people will actually make referrals taking the time to think of possible candidates prospects in response to your query or even proactively referring people to you when they hear of a need but they only do that if they have a strong enough relationship with you otherwise youre undifferentiated from the dozens or hundreds of other recruiters theyre connected to strong relationships not large contact databases build this kind of business
922884 linkedin combines job listings candidate search trusted referrals and the power of networks to give you results
922885 she has been part of the linkedin network for over three years during that time she has used the linkedin network in a number of different ways to find employees including searching by employer current past using inmail purchasing advertising and networking
922886 is a great venue to build and develop long term strategic relationships it allows us to proactively network and learn on a continual basis
922887 i have personally been a part of the linkedin community since my early career
922888 first we posted the position and second we viewed potential candidates through second and third party connections via my immediate contacts and requesting an introduction i got great response met with a few candidates and filled the position with a linkedin member
922889 most of our candidates come from either our own internal database referrals cold calling and non online networking associations however when i cant find a very specific candidate through those means i will definitely keep linkedin as a serious recruit networking source
922890 i do advanced searches to identify potential candidates and typically will send inmails rather than trying to get to a person via the introduction route if an individual has an email address posted in their profile i may also send an email directly to the person
922891 i have filled several jobs over the years and typically they are at the executive level i dont see much below a senior manager or director level as being very effective on linkedin but at senior manager director vp ceo levels it is great

922925 the thing we need is an architecture that combines the full programmability of the cpu with the kinds of parallelism and other special capabilities of graphics processors and that architecture is larrabee
922926 it is not a gpu as many have mistakenly described it but it can do most graphics functions
922927 it looks like a gpu and acts like a gpu but actually what its doing is introducing a large number of x86 cores into your pc
922928 larrabee does not require a special api larrabee will excel on standard graphics apis
922929 so existing games will be able to run on larrabee products

922980 you couldnt really buy the times i had i left every day played here for nine years or something and im happy with that they deserve the money they have a short career
922981 i had a long career funnily enough people who come up to me even now and they say ah yeah youre the qpr man but they forget i played for 17 and a half years even nottingham forest the champions league as it is now they won twice but people dont remember me for that its just qpr
922982 but its very nice youve got to remember ive not played for getting on 27 years and the people still like me here i got on well with the crowd and they liked me and everything some of the players now as soon as theyve finished youve never heard of them again im lucky
922983 no i dont think so with all the new rules and things like that you could get away with murder in the old days people like ronnie harris and tommy smith at liverpool they punched you they kicked you but there wasnt that many cameras there then you got away with it you had to sort it out after the game not with tommy smith though he knew a few faces
922984 a lot of works been done on the ground and a lot of moneys been pumped into it lets hope they can get together a side as good as the one i played in
922985 i didnt realise quite how good our side was its just when i look back theyll be very lucky to get a team like that
922986 i know iain dowie very well because i was friends with him when he worked under gerry francis theyll be a very fit side thats for sure because hes really strong on that theyre favourites to win the league this year but ive not had a bet on them anyway theyll probably win it now
922987 the ground i think is 18 000 capacity theyre going to have to move its going to be a shame to lose this ground because of its history but theyre going to have to really

923009 we must learn not to love the idea of the church but the real church
923010 how i wish i could find a church that is unintentially pentecostal while being intentionally biblical where immersion in the word is the focus of the pulpit the community and the believers where worship is a spiritual discipline not an event to pass the time and be entertained by where fellowship occurs in the context of real relationships not merely scheduled events i want a simple church where the proclamation of the transforming word and relational mentoring occurs on multiple dimensions where programs and events take second chair to the growth of the community

923017 we cannot accept people paying money for tickets and not getting them
923018 they have known about these sites for months and months and did nothing
923019 they have dashed the hopes and dreams of thousands of people who have been planning for years to go the games and have already paid thousands of dollars for airfare and what they thought were legitimate tickets
923020 our sympathy goes to them but we certainly arent in a position to step in compensate or find other tickets
923021 we warned folk to only deal with authorised ticket suppliers
923022 the worst thing is that some people dont even know yet that they bought tickets that wont arrive
923023 some were told they could pick up the tickets at an office in beijing and they wont be there my guess is they sold thousands of tickets that dont exist
923024 i havent decided which one yet ill probably make that decision once we have opened in chichester

923068 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
923069 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
923070 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
923071 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
923072 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
923073 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
923074 i think weve got a lot of speed out there and a lot of size with that speed
923075 you dont really know until the first game ive always said special teams 20 percent of it is doing the scheme and 80 percent is just the will
923076 hes more of an open field type using his space same thing with what makes him an effective wide receiver same reason why he doesnt play running back
923077 hes not a point of attack guy where youre going to just try and ram him up inside hes a guy that youre going to utilize the field and try to spread him out some again he brings something to the table in terms of kick return as well but right now we feel really good with what bookers got
923078 hes a guy that has great speed great speed and great vision very similar to the running back position he knows where the reads are on returns he knows where to break off of those reads
923079 one thing that we were questioning there was whether or not he would be able to break the tackles and hes shown out here during the live practice sessions that he is capable of breaking tackles running from scrimmage its obviously a little bit different on the kick return aspect of it youve got guys flying around coming downhill at him but we feel like he could definitely get the job done here
923080 please believe before we go down to pittsburgh for fridays preseason opener i will be having a conversation or two with my guy
923081 hes one of my best friends anyway but the guy is as good at kick returns as anybody
923082 more guys will have an opportunity to hit you on kick return as opposed to punt
923083 you can make one guy miss and be off to the races on a punt return i think it takes a certain toughness to be a kick returner
923084 the biggest thing i see people are coming down on kickoffs full speed you got to see a hole to envision a return
923085 punt returns you basically wait for the ball to come down and once you get it in your hands you can do a little more movement back there punt return is more open kickoffs you have to hit it and go
923086 the suicide theory has become dominant in the investigation but all those who knew ivan safronov categorically reject it
923087 if the opportunity comes again i feel like it would be a definite id think about it wie told the
923088 i think if i played a couple pga events in a row it would be a different story its just hard to play one and then one maybe a year later i think if i played eight in a row and i missed all eight that would be a different story
923089 carl asked what would you do if the track would get cleaned up and wed run the race green i told him we would come in for two tires
923090 i felt you left it up to me when jimmie committed to pitting i thought well go ahead and pit
923091 we were trying to blame one another for the idea of pitting
923092 i had to leave the pit box because i was worried that bob would punch me in the neck but we have a good relationship we can be completely honest with one another
923093 then we get back together and calmer heads prevail we come to terms with what we want to do and 99 percent of the time it works out for us
923094 finally running with the guys up front is a great feeling
923095 there was something wrong with the horse in the belmont but i could see in the mornings since that he was the same horse
923096 i planned to go to the lead but it would have been suicidal
923097 i felt pretty cozy until the leader took off on the final turn i said to myself this wont be easy big brown had to go and get him
923098 i didnt know he had this kind of courage hes a warrior i love this horse hes so intelligent if he was a human being id want to go clubbing with him
923099 since ive been born its been a roller coaster for me
923100 hes a special horse i dont care what anybody says
923101 i saw a dimension of big brown today that i just didnt know existed
923102 he showed more than just his ability he showed his heart thats the sign of a great race horse
923103 the plan was to go to the lead but that would have been suicidal
923104 that guy on the outside was making the lead no matter what
923105 if big brown was a human being id want to go clubbing with him
923106 curlin couldnt win this race we could curlin got beat by a filly we havent our horse is undefeated on the grass curlin isnt i dont know why people think curlin is such a good horse were way better than curlin
923107 if i do it once theyll just expect me to do it again
923108 they had told me they were thinking about giving me a day off so you have to be ready you know youre going to fit in somewhere
923109 ive just got to keep going out there and hoping the team gets a win when i pitch
923110 that teams good man all of them are good hitters if you make a mistake theyll hit it
923111 they were just swinging and i appreciate that it made my job easier
923112 i feel like hes showed us two real good performances in a row now
923113 i knew when i put him in hed come back around to hit
923114 the fear of allah is not there so we have now a polluted earth a polluted water a wasteland
923115 what are the people now crying for the prophet told you hundreds of years ago look after the water
923116 if you look at the last three to six months you will see that nato forces have reviewed their procedures as they constantly do and you see that the issue has become less of an issue
923117 there has been a surge in the number of civilian casualties caused by all sides in the conflict a spread of insecurity to previously stable areas and increasing attacks on aid agencies and their staff

923119 that you only talk to family when death comes why is it that a death must occur for your family to come together
923120 the second one i really rolled into it and protected it
923121 id actually never seen them doing that before i thought ahhh something an old guy can do too without getting injured it was kinda fun you know to catch passes would be more fun but to catch donovans ball i think the golf game would be destroyed
923122 hes a good athlete hes got a little bit of a sore ankle but hes played through that and hes done very well with it it hurts him a little bit when hes being bull rushed because he cant put his foot in the ground like he wants to hes moving around very well hes got very long arms and knows how to use them hes not afraid to play the game out in front of him ive been impressed by the way hes handled himself
923123 wavemakers visual ajax studio for mac comes at a very opportune time apple is gaining momentum in the enterprise and wavemaker gives enterprise users an easy and visual way to build web applications
923124 what we know is that we have never gotten good browser enhancements and tools from the market leader
923125 i said you know what it looks legit because its not some gimmick
923126 it involves actually working hard and changing the regimen all the time
923127 id be real happy if i was able to keep this type of power and consistency through the season
923128 i liked it because it really worked a lot with the explosion of the legs
923129 jumping cardio aerobic push ups pull ups jumping back and forth its crazy yoga stretch tempo its all kind of mixed into one
923130 and he was standing on a chair doing it at first
923131 hes hit them in warm ups hes hit them during our team reps
923132 theyve kind of said through one of their front office guys that if favre did report they would potentially trade him within the division
923133 the bears just kind of are what they are i dont see him in detroit either at least the vikings offense is what hes used to old dogs dont learn new tricks especially in three weeks
923134 hes already carried this thing out too far its kind of a joke
923135 im glad im doing it now as opposed to a couple days from now when we go to pittsburgh
923136 its not bad at all today was a good test to see where im at and i feel good
923137 if you have five rookies on your offense youre going to have some offensive mistakes there and its going to cost you at some point or another
923138 same thing that we ran into with special teams last year we had some great athletes on the field but one guy would make a mistake and it would look like the whole scheme was busted
923139 its a lot easier for the guys that have been out there that have been in the battles to understand the little concepts of the game even a center trying to pick out and rub a guy off
923140 i feel very lucky but i know how much hard work ive put in to get here
923141 ive always wanted to play in the olympics ive scratched and clawed for this moment and now that its here i really want to take advantage and show the world what i can do
923142 i had my parents and my boyfriend come to last years world cup but this is a big time event for me and it makes it a lot easier when there are no distractions one less thing to worry about
923143 its all good though they know i love them and i know theyll be rooting me on
923144 james helped me get to the next level he made me his project and really worked on strengthening not just my physical and technical game but he worked on me mentally
923145 i always had a dream of playing on this u s team and when i heard the doubts of others james was the one that pushed me and made me realize that i could do it hes one person i dont want to let down

923148 have courage to experiment because no one gets it right on the first attempt
923149 the most important community building task is to create heroes within the community
923150 the process of creating a community is still more of a black art than science
923151 dont change the rules in a way which penalizes the community users for their contributions

923157 he threw strikes was very aggressive going after hitters and looked very poised and under control to me
923158 but whether or not well call him up is something we cant discuss publicly we would need a reason to bring him but there is no question he has major league stuff
923159 carrasco has had major league stuff since he was 19 but well evaluate him like we would any pitcher well need him to be more consistent in the strike zone like he was tonight we want him to grow more mature more i like the maturity hes shown tonight i think carrasco will create his own timetable to get to the majors hell let us know when hes ready and when his time will come were willing to be patient and see if he can get major league hitters out consistently
923160 this is the best and healthiest ive been this year
923161 this is definitely the hardest i threw this season i havent thrown 96 until today i feel more mature i want to stay here and get more experience i want to do my job
923162 i just saw ruben outside the clubhouse after the game
923163 but i was having a little tenderness in my right shoulder about 3 weeks ago it bothered the way i threw but i felt great tonight its the best velocity i had this season
923164 whether thats in september or not well see but were pretty pleased with our starters now so i dont know where hell fit
923165 but he showed me tonight three major league pitches with an occasional slider and was consistent with them all
923166 i met with the coaches got a tour of the campus
923167 it seemed to be the right place and the right fit for me
923168 he makes fun of everybody i didnt want to tell him he runs like an old man but you know youve got to be sensitive with the quarterback
923169 ive been there china before and had a great time i thought it was really an amazing composition of old and new youd seen a high rise and passing in front of the high rise was an older guy on a bicycle with so many things piled up on the back im curious to see whats happened since ive been there 3 years ago
923170 from everything from the opening ceremonies to trading pins with athletes its different
923171 i was a big pin trader in my time the sense of togetherness with your teammates is awesome
923172 of course i feel a little bit sorry for felipe i know how he feels with what happened to him today ive had similar moments to him this year
923173 he really hit with a lot of uppercuts but i never felt anything
923174 i usually dont look for anything i usually try and react
923175 he threw a couple fastballs a couple change ups he left the fastball over the plate and i got the barrel to it
923176 thats where youve got to step off and say hey the only thing that matters is this next pitch and im one pitch away from getting out of it one pitch away from giving it up too but you dont want to think about those types of things
923177 angelina w re die perfekte wahl f r diese rolle meine freunde aus dem showbiz haben mir verraten dass sie schon nachforschungen ber die rolle angestellt haben soll welche schauspielerin w rde bei solch einem erfolg am box office nicht bei solch einem flm dabei sein wollen

923180 god loves every one of his human creatures and christ died for all of us so that we all have hope of eternal salvation by his grace alone
923181 yes god became flesh and jesus lived a sinless life and sacrificed himself dying a brutal torturous death all the while restraining himself from calling a legion of angels to rescue him he died and then rose conquering death and the grave showed himself to his disciples and empowered them through the holy spirit to share this gospel and pass it down the generations god did all this but i get credit too because i accepted the invitation im my own co savior
923182 accepting a freely given gift of salvation somehow would make you your own
923183 do whatever it takes so that you gives god all the glory
923184 some not all calvinists believe that gods sovereignty necessitates an absolute determinism in which he predetermines every event that has occurred or will occur
923185 hes hit everything pitches at every location whether its because hes from here and he gets fired up to play us i dont know but hes been very very good against us
923186 i guess i get a little fired up to play these guys
923187 its my hometown team you know everybody back home is watching
923188 it makes me feel like im 15 again with my family coming to see the games
923189 maybe hes more relaxed against these guys because he grew up here
923190 i think hes going to be very serviceable for us
923191 he pitched just like our scouts said he could almost to a t
923192 he commanded everything changed speeds well and made very few mistakes location wise he was just the guy we hoped to see

923196 a slut who was never a slut before a slut who spent 20 years in a sexless marriage the last 12 years of it at least and now is finally having some fun a slut who discovered much too late that her hubby would rather wank than fuck a slut whos finally finding out how to have some fun
923197 and by the way what makes you think im a slut
923198 i usually dont look for anything i usually try and react
923199 he threw a couple fastballs a couple change ups he left the fastball over the plate and i got the barrel to it
923200 ill just tell all of you to say whatever you want and write whatever you want
923201 thats all ive got for you you guys write about it you saw it you write whatever you want report whatever you want

923206 we are sending out requests today to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games
923207 we are also urging video game arcades to pull the games from service
923208 he said he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game
923209 its like wearing a visor except a visor gets wet and fogged up and everything
923210 its a little bit of a red tinge its just like wearing sunglasses its not a huge change it brings out the red and the green takes away the blue
923211 i didnt think i could finish it there at the end
923212 although i was hadnt won i was confident i was going to win
923213 i told everybody that knows me that its just a matter of time its going to come this was a six week run and i was geared up to win im glad that it happened the first week out
923214 to finish with a birdie was special there didnt seem to be any doubt it was going in
923215 als ich aufwuchs war ich kein riesiger fan der serie ich habe sie aber nat rlich gesehen und kannte sie allein schon das bild von captain kirk auf der br cke in seinem stuhl ist kult wenn man das goldene shirt sieht wei man was gerade l uft
923216 oh ich habe gerade wohl etwas ausgeplaudert ich bin gerade etwas ersch pft
923217 ich habe sogar eine version der story geschrieben in der daniel die ganze zeit in der arktis bleibt aber als ich es geschrieben habe hab ich raus gefunden dass ich michael nicht f r das zeug in der arktis haben konnte weil er nicht verf gbar sein w rde also musste ich das script ndern um zu erkl ren warum daniel nicht bei den anderen beiden ist wenn sie ber das eis wandern ich glaube eigentlich dass daraus zwei wirklich dramatische szenen wurden weshalb ich eigentlich ganz froh damit war manchmal sind ver nderungen gut manchmal machen ver nderungen ein script besser
923218 its huge to win your first sort of major tournament and to do it in a match like today makes it more special
923219 i put in a lot of work off the court to be able to win these sorts of tournaments and it makes it all worthwhile
923220 now he knows what he has and where hes going to be
923221 he knows its time to get in the gym 100 percent working hard
923222 this is where he wanted to be we went through the business aspects to see what his value and level of interest around the nba might be but he wanted to stay with the sixers and they were very fair with him hes a very very mature minded 21 year old in his thinking
923223 durch die beobachtungen des mars odyssey orbiters sowie die verschwindenden klumpen die phoenix letzten monat bemerkte haben wir schon belege f r dieses wassereis erhalten dies ist jedoch das erste mal dass mars wasser geschmeckt und gerochen wurde
923224 wir finden schon wege mit ihr zu arbeiten der mars gibt uns einige berraschungen
923225 phoenix ist gesund und die vorhersagen der sonnenenergie sehen gut aus so dass wir diese quelle in der interessantesten region des marses voll nutzen wollen
923226 j j abrams hat deutlich gemacht dass wir dem tribut zollen was diese m nner mit der erschaffung der charaktere geleistet haben und dann unsere eigene herangehensweise finden ich habe mich nie dadurch belastet gef hlt mr shatner hat sehr typisch und einzigartig gespielt und ich habe versucht dem bereits etablierten gerecht zu werden aber zu versuchen shatner nachzuahmen w re nicht klug gewesen
923227 das produktionsdesign wird die leute umhauen es zollt dem aussehen der 60er jahre tribut aber es ist sehr zeitgem und die apparaturen sind unglaublich cool
923228 it was a crazy ballgame but it was a big win
923229 defense is an asset to this club and we just didnt get it done today it was a poor game
923230 i just think they are more exciting this is one of the longest lap times about 55 seconds that we have besides a road course and certainly the longest race we have
923231 to go 500 miles under this lap time is a long long day and it gets pretty spread out i just think we could put on a little more exciting race with a 400 mile race
923232 we need to put on the best show possible for the fans this track is so big we get a separation of cars around the 2 5 mile track
923233 we need to find a way to compress some action so it might be better racing if the fans like it the mattiolis will like it
923234 we still may hold a few guys out in different practices as we go along were getting worn down a little bit
923235 right now we need to get the fluid out of his knee and get that thing settled down a little bit
923236 our governments have failed us both major parties are terminally addicted to coal the situation is dreadful and we have been forced to take this action because the leadership of this country is morally bankrupt
923237 there is no longer any room for vacillation we must act and that is what we are doing today
923238 when faced with an overwhelming problem and a government unwilling or unable to take action to solve the problem it is the duty of all citizens to take action on the communitys behalf
923239 there is no way australia can continue passing the buck on climate change we are the biggest per capita emitter of greenhouse gases and the biggest coal exporter in the world
923240 hundreds of community members have pledged to take direct action to prevent the expansion of the coal industry
923241 we are taking action today on behalf of our children and for all those species that will be pushed to the extinction by climate change it is unconscionable for the government and the coal industry to continue profiting from accelerating greenhouse gas emissions in this way

923246 its okays to have sex with young girls even the government is encourging us by legalising it
923247 prostitution will only result in mass transmission of stds within a society
923248 i often hear now a days the automobile instigated good roads that the automobile is the parent of good roads well the truth is the bicycle is the father of the good roads movement in this country
923249 the league of american wheelmen was formed in 1879 with each state organized as a division the league was the first organization that promoted the building of better roads the league fought for the privilege of building bicycle paths along the side of public highways the league fought for the privilege of carrying bicycles in baggage cars on railroads the league fought for equal privileges with horse drawn vehicles all these battles were won and the bicyclist was accorded equal rights with other users of highways and streets
923250 this stuff that he just did here its totally not in his character
923251 everybodys going to see the bad stuff and thats all theyre going to remember
923252 when he was down hed always get in touch with me
923253 my dads a real smart guy he says i drove to bjs today and i saved 8 cents a gallon hes lost money and he still brags about it
923254 i think the reasons are as different as people are
923255 i avoid citgo because i got water in my gas one time years ago some people swear by shell
923256 he never had one day of married life without a mother in law and a niece
923257 quite frankly the last year or two he didnt do a whole lot
923258 not having a place to come would have killed him sooner

923264 hes the one person i would like in the situation we are in because we know we are in for a dogfight
923265 its probably the most important signing luton have made for some time in terms of his effort his commitment and his desire to play for the club
923266 he made it plain to us that he wanted to come back and try and help the club stay up this season he will be the captain and he has made a big commitment
923267 he was on a long term contract at preston and hes done a deal with them which wasnt very favourable to him
923268 the reason hes come back is to try and help me and luton town get ourselves out of this situation
923269 and thats what we hope to offer our goal is to provide a rough translation of a quality designer polo at a fraction of the cost without compromising quality and style

923273 iedereen kan maria aanvragen voor een weekje steun bij zichzelf of bij iemand anders
923274 belangrijk daarbij is wel dat de aanvrager een goede reden moet hebben om maria te leen te geven waarom hoort maria negen dagen op die plek bij die persoon en wat zou de aanwezigheid van maria teweeg kunnen brengen
923275 na negen dagen halen we maria weer terug en horen we wat haar aanwezigheid met de begunstigde gedaan heeft
923276 daarna is het de bedoeling dat maria weer naar een volgende locatie of persoon gaat voor negen dagen aanwezigheid
923277 bezoekers kunnen er een kaarsje branden voor zichzelf of voor de persoon waar maria te leen op dat moment is
923278 de verhalen worden op de site verzameld en zijn daar voor de bezoekers ter inspiratie te lezen

923310 bruce couldnt think his way out of a wet paper sack so we canned him
923311 a friend of mine knows her from way back they went to high school together seems that shirin and the director got into a huge argument over some development assistant that she fired sounded like he was some pet project of the directors so he was super pissed when she axed him she got an offer from another organization you know the blahblahblah them so what does shirin do when she leaves she shreds half the files
923312 the best part my friend says she does that all the time thats like the fifth or sixth organization whose files shes shredded
923313 well as long as you dont piss her off she does bring in the money

923336 we ask the public not to fall prey to rumors
923337 and then the argument will be made that a sitting president cannot be liable that they should not be liable for a trial or subjected to a trial because it will bring the country into disrepute
923338 i can feel its not appropriate if i know im guilty
923339 why should i feel its not appropriate when im not guilty
923340 obviously the strength of this case and how the courts act in this case and in other cases of a high profile nature will either strengthen our institutions or weaken them
923341 and lets hope they deal with it in a way that respects due process of the law that respects the rights of individuals but also respects the need for justice to be seen to be done
923342 i think deans has got no choice now hes got to throw him in there
923343 weve got one of the best line out exponents in the world in dan vickerman hes been injured and came on as a replacement but weve got to obviously shore that up because the south africans are fairly good in the line out with victor matfield so weve got to get our basics right
923344 it will be tough and im not saying they can do it but theyve got probably more chance of defeating the springboks than the wallabies
923345 itll be a horror trip for the wallabies theres no doubt about it just going on past history as much as were bad in new zealand were probably worse in south africa
923346 i think burgess came on to the scene with a great hullabaloo i think hes played reasonably well i think hes probably a little bit off the pace at the moment
923347 hes only a young guy and i guess like everybody when the forwards are doing well you look okay
923348 but what we want our players to do is under pressure theyve got to rise to the occasion and i think luke burgess was probably missing a little bit and it probably reflected on the way matt played

923385 its quadrupled in the last four weeks to two to three a week compared to one big one a month during the summer
923386 if i had to give you an explanation for the increase in motorcycle accidents id say its primarily due to inexperienced riders not going through the proper training courses that are available
923387 they are getting onto bikes for economic reasons to save money on gas then they put themselves into situations that they are not prepared for

923414 having had the chance to examine in detail the circumstances surrounding richard s death we are now reconciled to the fact that he indeed did take his own life we acknowledge that the amount of suffering and extreme hardships he witnessed at first hand in many harrowing situations throughout the world proved too much for him to bear

923416 according to information before ipi mills died under unknown circumstances mills was in zimbabwe on an undercover assignment that included interviewing on the day of his death a white farmer who was attacked after speaking against president robert mugabe
923417 instead his family was informed that he had died and that the cause of his death was asphyxiation by hanging
923418 such a record triggers profound doubt about the zimbabwean authorities claims as to the cause of mills death we therefore call on you president mbeki to raise this incident in future discussions with zimbabwean authorities and to ensure that it is investigated both thoroughly and openly
923419 we share the deep suspicion of richard mills family over the circumstances of the death of this gifted colleague it casts a fresh shadow over the crisis for democracy in zimbabwe
923420 the dreaded central intelligence organisation has been implicated in the mysterious death of the times newspaper journalist richard mills in harare

923515 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money

923532 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays

923534 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
923535 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
923536 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
923537 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
923538 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
923539 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
923540 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
923541 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
923542 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
923543 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
923544 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
923545 people who vote against this today are voting against me and i will not forget
923546 why would we want to rebuild these homes in an area below sea level

923551 in der eu ist es leichter sich ber standards f r eine k sesorte zu einigen als ber das angemessene strafma f r ein vergehen in polen gibt es f r vergewaltigung drei monate f r einen handydiebstahl dagegen auch gern mal drei jahre f r einen richter ist es psychologisch ungeheuer schwierig jemanden auszuliefern der im eigenen land eine deutlich geringere strafe zu erwarten h tte
923552 wir liefern keine polnischen staatsb rgerinnen aus die f r eine abtreibung zu uns gekommen sind das ist in schweden nicht strafbar
923553 aber dieser polnische bereifer verstopft das ganze system und erzeugt hohe kosten
923554 unsere provinzgerichte stellen ganz routinem ig die haftbefehle aus f r den staatsanwalt ist das nur ein kleines formular und ein knopfdruck auf dem computer doch die kosten f r die berf hrung des verd chtigen f r den transport und die unterkunft der begleitenden polizeibeamten tr gt die polnische polizei nicht die justiz 2006 hat das beinah unser budget gesprengt
923555 wir haben nicht das proportionalit tsprinzip sondern das legalit tsprinzip
923556 wir w rden uns von der eu kommission leitlinien w nschen damit unser gesetzgeber gen tigt w re die umsetzung des rahmenbeschlusses in polnisches recht zu ndern
923557 tschechische staatsb rger liefern wir nur aus wenn das verbrechen nach 2004 begangen wurde und auch bei uns strafbar ist
923558 aber die konservative parlamentsmehrheit weigert sich das ausf hrungsgesetz zu ndern

923568 weve got a number of warrants out on him for burglary assault et cetera
923569 i immediately got into it as soon as i got upstairs
923570 i kept saying okay remember your cpr training you got to do the abcs
923571 so i just went ahead and gave it all i got
923572 cpr performed by a citizen or bystander correlates with double or tripling the survival rate
923573 we really need to penetrate the population for more people to step up and perform cpr
923574 people are afraid to intervene afraid to step up and help
923575 the training builds a comfort level to encourage people to act thats what its all about
923576 he said it charged him from about six to eight feet away he felt his life and well being were in jeopardy so he shot two to three times with a 44 magnum
923577 we tracked it for quite a while it went back to the sterling highway crossed the road and then went up a hillside which is where we ran into her
923578 it was our obligation to end her suffering and it was too close to a populated area like the russian river to have a wounded animal
923579 we heard shooting in the distance while we were dragging these bears out and we saw a good size black bear picking up carcasses in the fly fishing area above the power lines
923580 he was in a public access place and he said he was making so much noise he felt silly about it but he ran into her and he ran into another bear farther up the trail but he yelled at it and ran it off
923581 we need to get a grasp on preventing bears from getting into human generated food items such as carcasses stringers sandwiches in backpacks and coolers in the campground until that issue is addressed were going to continue to see the same thing dead bears
923582 the current system is not working there is a strong educational effort there but its not enough to date few tickets have been written in this area so possibly one way to fix it is we need to step up regulations that will be strictly enforced
923583 responsible fishermen need to speak up in a nonconfrontational way when they see someone doing something wrong and say the right thing to do so that others can follow
923584 we have the organizational ability and the financial ability to compete there
923585 there is a real sense of energy coming off that campaign that is completely lacking from the other side
923586 some of the old givens are no longer true its not how it was 20 years ago or even 10 years ago
923587 it cant be understated that he is from our neighboring state
923588 barack obama coming up here and competing here is going to force john mccain to make a choice
923589 for everything that mccain does up here thats a little bit less that he can do in these big battleground states we always hear about
923590 we all believe were going to win the gold medal so for him to go out there and say that put the pressure on us to go out and compete at a high level
923591 but she definitely came over to talk to him after that as did many people
923592 i think were gonna see that girl win the gold medal
923593 the next day i called my boss and quit my job i decided to raise my daughters
923594 i never had an olympic dream till two years ago
923595 we hope it will not only serve the summer visitors but alaska residents as well at they go into the yukon and points beyond
923596 we are developing a new film to be shown there and an exhibit area and study classroom for environmental education
923597 you certainly want to hold out hope as long as you possibly can
923598 but its probably a one in a million chance we got reports that people saw him fall
923599 coming down they got to the bottleneck where all these fixed ropes are in place
923600 a huge piece of ice broke off from on or near the summit and it took out the fixed ropes and took out anyone on them
923601 we decided when we were doing our set not to mention it
923602 we felt everyone who knew him would know what was going on at that stage
923603 he loved to have the crack as wed say in ireland
923604 very funny he was a philosopher a great storyteller and just a wonderful warm kind loving person
923605 who knows what happened it would be irresponsible for me to speculate
923606 he and his wife were just wonderful people ordinary sweet wonderful people

923610 cdcs first estimates from this system reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known results indicate that approximately 56 300 new hiv infections occurred in the united states in 2006
923611 this figure is roughly 40 percent higher than cdcs former estimate of 40 000 infections per year which was based on limited data and less precise methods
923612 though the number of new hiv infections remains unacceptably high
923613 the analysis shows that new infections peaked in the mid 1980s at approximately 130 000 infections per year and reached a low of about 50 000 in the early 1990s
923614 a large number of prior reports have demonstrated that because of issues of social instability related to illicit drug addiction hiv infected injecting drug users may not be deriving the full benefits of haart hiv drugs
923615 i think about that every day and i say im glad im not a first round pick because that would be a whole bunch of pressure
923616 not that its not a lot of pressure them just drafting me no matter what round because they believe that you can play i just have to work hard to show them that i was worth that pick
923617 mario is not improving the way wed like him to so well just continue to push him
923618 im sure hes probably trying to fire me up because thats his job
923619 im just coming out here to work every day theyre the coaches they know a lot better than i do i still do have a lot to work on
923620 its just that when you come here you dont have any scholarships you cant sit around for four years you better get it now i still can get cut drafted or not so thats the one thing that ive got to keep on my mind
923621 am i naive enough to think nothings going to happen
923622 no it probably will its the competitive nature of these guys and they dont want to be shown up and theyre mad when they are
923623 well try to handle it the best that we can but weve got to be prepared for it if it happens well shut it down if in the first practice theres too much of it going on well shut it down and practice against ourselves

923631 ive made the decision today to resign as leader of the parliamentary liberal party because i believe its in the best interests of the western australian liberal party
923632 there is a massive political opportunity at the next state election and i think i owe it to our candidates to my fellow members of cabinet and to the liberal party to make sure we have every opportunity to win government at that election
923633 most observers of politics would know that my six months as parliamentary leader has not been without its challenges
923634 however during that time i feel that weve done a good job in holding the government to account when theyve made mistakes
923635 im confident that ive made the right decision im confident ive made an honourable decision
923636 i do not want to give the government the opportunity to take the focus off of its failings by engaging in cheap personality based politics
923637 i give an assurance today that whoever replaces me as leader of the parliamentary liberal party will have my 100 per cent support both on the record and off the record

923639 the live export industry employs around 12 000 people in australia so this investment will contribute to the sustainability of the cattle and sheep industries
923640 after almost 80 successful voyages we now know that we can deliver livestock to their destinations happier healthier and heavier than when they boarded
923641 in total we have invested over 330m in new livestock vessels that benefits the animals the producers the shippers and the receivers and we see significant and increasing demand for this standard of livestock carriage which exceeds governmental standards and is totally focussed on animal welfare
923642 using these vessels we know that the animals will arrive in better condition than when they boarded which makes both welfare and commercial good sense
923643 just as australias livestock industry relies on the live export trade the live export industry relies on the fast technologically advanced vessels to ensure their stock arrive at their destination fit and healthy
923644 these new vessels will benefit every participant throughout the live export chain a quarter of a billion dollars isnt just a big investment in shipping tonnage its a big investment in the future of the australian livestock industry

923647 der har fra alle sider naturligvis ikke mindst ejendomsm glernes v ret nske om at l sne op for den meget fastl ste situation p boligmarkedet men det er uvished der pr ger stemningen i jeblikket og i et usikkert marked stiger eftersp rgslen p tryghed og vi ser netop forsikringen som et tryghedsskabende tilbud

923672 milton is one of the most ambitious and prodigiously talented literary geniuses ever to have lived among english writers only shakespeare matches him for sheer imaginative splendour and dazzling command of the language
923673 he was also a courageous and militant champion of the causes of liberty and equality his passionate love of freedom and hatred of tyranny is a message we still need to hear
923674 we hope that this event will not only bring public attention to one of the most sublime poets of the english language but also be fun
923675 rich countries must reduce if not eliminate distortional agriculture and energy policies and help those in the poorest countries improve their capacity to produce food but this is just a start we have treated our most precious resources clean air and water as if they were free only new patterns of consumption and production a new economic model can address that most fundamental resource problem
923676 i have heard that people may become dependent on us for food to me that is good news because before people can do anything they have got to eat and if you are looking for a way to get people to lean on you and be dependent on you in terms of their own cooperation with you it seems to me that food dependence would be terrific
923677 those in the poorest countries improve their capacities to produce food
923678 let us remember that the main purpose of aid is not to help other nations but to help ourselves
923679 the push by some developing countries to become more self sufficient in food may be reminiscent of a bygone era these countries could save money by importing more food from the us
923680 food self sufficiency is a peculiarly obtuse way of thinking about food security there is no particular problem even without self sufficiency in achieving nutritional security through the elimination of poverty so that people can buy food and through the availability of food in the world market so that countries can import food if there is not an adequate stock at home the focus has to be on income and entitlement and the ability to command food rather than on any fetishist concern about food self sufficiency
923681 there are situations in which self sufficiency is important such as during wars at one stage in the second world war there was a real danger of britain not being able to get enough food into the country but that is a very peculiar situation and we are not in one like that now nor are we likely to be in the near future

923722 overturning of section 377 this archaic and brutal law that has served no good purpose
923723 section 377 is a breach of the rights to privacy human dignity and the right to life
923724 when working in the field with sexual minority groups with intervention efforts related to safer sex practices organisations are often harassed by local police and goondas who claim we are promoting the culture of homosexuality
923725 it criminalises a consenting act between two adults discriminating against citizens on the basis of those who can have consensual sex and those who cannot and this is unacceptable in a democracy
923726 it homosexuality is not a health hazard but is affecting the home
923727 deletion of this section would open the flood gates of delinquent behaviour and be misconstrued as providing unbridled licence to the same
923728 morality is not the business of law when certain human rights are being violated in addition there are enough instances to convincingly argue that public attitude toward homosexuality is reasonably tolerant
923729 repeated instances of the culture argument have risks of putting in jeopardy the gains of the womens rights movement or the movement for the upliftment of dalits and other oppressed castes the civil rights movement the social gains that have been made over the years of struggle all of these movements have been conducted in opposition to some or the other prevailing majoritarian belief system
923730 i am open about my sexuality but i dont flaunt it i dont want to hear about what others do in the privacy of their own homes and i dont talk about what i do i dont participate in parades because what i do in the bedroom doesnt matter to the rest of my life why should i parade about it
923731 different christian groups sometimes even within denominations interpret the scriptures differently very fundamentalist groups often claim to be bible based churches while liberal churches claim that being a bible based church is a heresy because christ is the churchs one foundation the bible teaches that god is love thus the question of homosexual marriage doesnt go to the bible but to gods love for his creation many other churches however rejected our basic belief that jesus died for the whosoever
923732 my views on equality for everyone including women and homosexuals definitely sway my vote the land of the free doesnt extend to everyone who lives here as a feminist i notice when women are downtrodden and not treated as equals homosexual couples are not treated as well as heterosexual couples having marital rights would give homosexual couples rights to inherit visit their spouse in the hospital insure each other and many other rights which those of us who are heterosexual take for granted
923733 the same sex bill is not a priority for any conservative government the bill can be easily forgotten pushing our struggle back by 10 to 15 years
923734 the government may or may not be ready to remove all discrimination from society but the city of vienna is
923735 it is very important for young people to watch the parade and to see us celebrate life without fear the parade is an occasion to show our pride in who we are
923736 we have not yet reached full equality but we sense the political will to get there this is not enough you must now not stay silent when other countries that have entered the eu or knock on its door violate the rights of their own citizens never forget those who live around the world in fear and despair who face persecution humiliation imprisonment and death for simply being who they are i hope that foreign guests will be brought to this memorial as well when they are shown the beautiful city of berlin
923737 i am so glad that i am blessed to have a vehicle in which to get around
923738 i am so happy and grateful for my job as i know that many dont have one
923739 i really do appreciate my eyes that see my ears that hear my mouth that tastes my legs that walk my arms that lift my hands that write my mind that thinks my knees that bend and my tongue that talks

923748 als geboren en getogen stadsjongens gebruiken we de stad al van jongs af aan als speeltuin eerst met onze bmxjes later als fietskoerier op baanfietsen en aangepaste mountainbikes voor ons is de de stad het mooiste parcours wat je kunt bedenken druk verkeer snel asfalt scherpe bochten en overal obstakels om daarvan te profiteren heb je een fiets nodig die is afgestemd op de omstandigheden in de stad rat bikes maakt deze fietsen snel wendbaar stijlvol en een garantie voor heel veel fun

923752 its been fascinating to get involved with the fiesta love factory love report and find out how the nation really loves to love i certainly wouldnt have banked on men topping the tables in believing in both soulmates and love at first sight by all accounts men looking for love should move to london and start making more trips across the channel
923753 in celebration of our fiesta love factory and having produced the new ford fiesta with real passion we wanted to delve into europes romantic sensibilities and really find out what else makes people tick our suspicions have certainly be confirmed that our nation is one that loves to love so we certainly hope people fall for the new fiesta too
923754 die spd ist heute falsch gepolt sie hat die reformpolitik nicht verinnerlicht und klammert sich an ein berkommenes sozialstaatsverst ndnis
923755 manchmal knallt clement einfach durch er will mit dem kopf durch die wand bis die zusammenf llt
923756 meine frau meint ich h tte einen leicht cholerischen charakter
923757 die spd und wolfgang clement m ssen einander aushalten dies galt und gilt auch f r manch anderes mitglied der partei f r beide seiten ist das nicht immer leicht aber es dient der sozialdemokratischen sache und nur darauf kommt es an
923758 nach einer gescheiterten beziehung habe ich mich an den weihnachtsfeiertagen an denen meine trauer und frust besonders gro waren bei elitepartner de angemeldet
923759 letztlich wei bsirske selbst am besten dass ihm seine instinktlosigkeit erster klasse nachh ngen wird die h me konservativer und liberaler politiker die jede vorlage aus dem gewerkschaftslager gen sslich verwandeln wird schnell abebben die verdi mitglieder aber werden sich bsirskes ausfall sp testens dann in erinnerung rufen wenn es der pilotenvereinigung cockpit und der unabh ngigen flugbegleiter organisation ufo gelingen sollte h here tarifabschl sse bei der lufthansa durchzusetzen als verdi jetzt erreichen konnte
923760 in der tat hat sich der spitzengewerkschafter damit zumindest den vorwurf der instinktlosigkeit verdient nicht so sehr wegen des kostenlosen fluges erster klasse der ihm als aufsichtsratsmitglied zusteht aber w hrend die gewerkschafts basis und die besch ftigten alle kr fte mobilisieren um nach mageren jahren auch endlich vom h henflug des kranichs zu profitieren erweist sich bsirske als luftikus und genie t samt ehefrau den ansonsten wohlverdienten urlaub in der s dsee das d rfte jeden wartungstechniker zum bedrohlichen luftholen veranlassen berhaupt wirft der fall bsirske erneut die frage auf ob spitzenfunktion re der gewerkschaften in aufsichtsr ten richtig sitzen denn der spagat zwischen arbeitnehmer und unternehmensinteressen wird f r manchen leicht zur zerrei probe
923761 diese form der schadenfreude schl gt jetzt frank bsirske entgegen der verbal seine ganze kraft der arbeiterschaft widmet in der tat aber die sonnigsten seiten des lebens genie t man nennt das links reden rechts leben tats chlich ist die linke auch auf diese weise gespalten es gibt eine linke gesinnung deren reale basis einfache lebensverh ltnisse sind in diesen f llen sind leben und reden aus einem guss also echt und es gibt die profi linke sie macht eine linkskarriere bis hinein in die gro e welt der privilegien
923762 bsirskes gratisflug mag rechtlich einwandfrei sein moralisch hingegen beweist der verdi chef erneut dass instinkt nicht zu seinen tugenden z hlt wer als gewerkschaftschef und lufthansa aufsichtsratsmitglied unmittelbar vor dem streik gratis richtung s dsee abhebt h tte wenigstens eine andere fluglinie w hlen m ssen doch bsirske schw chte fahrl ssig seine position dabei braucht seine gewerkschaft derzeit einen starken chef um die gegen die tarifeinigung bei der lufthansa rebellierende verdi basis zu beruhigen und eine drohende zerfaserung der tariffront bei der lufthansa zu verhindern
923763 in dem verfahren gegen mich ist von meinen bochumer freunden die mich ja mit innigster herzlichkeit verfolgen gesagt worden die agenda 2010 von gerhard schr der sei menschenverachtend das kann doch jemand wie ich nicht stehen lassen

923768 die itf ist angewiesen herrn rainer sch ttler in den herreneinzel wettbewerb der 24 olympiade aufzunehmen
923769 das wurde notwendig weil die itf mich entgegen den eigenen bestimmungen nicht auf die zulassungsliste f r die olympischen spiele aufgenommen hatte und die bef rchtung bestand dass die itf spieler in die einzelkonkurrenz aufnehmen wollte die auf der weltrangliste zum stichtag vom 9 juni 2008 weit hinter mir platziert waren

923775 nicht wir betreiben das internet in china sondern chinas beh rden
923776 ich verstehe nicht warum die chinesische regierung mit der begrenzung des internet zugangs erneut weltweite skepsis geweckt hat
923777 es hat absolut keinen deal gegeben keine vereinbarung mit den chinesen
923778 das ioc und allen voran pr sident rogge haben sich zum komplizen des chinesischen regimes gemacht indem sie bedingungen wissentlich oder stillschweigend geduldet haben die den idealen der olympischen spiele nicht entsprechen

923789 ich bin richtig happy vor allem nach dem bisherigen saison verlauf heute waren felipe und lewis anfangs richtig schnell aber mitte des rennens habe ich gemerkt dass es irgendwie in meine richtung l uft der sieg honoriert das team vor dem ich absolut den hut ziehe
923790 als felipe pl tzlich stehen blieb dachte ich ich sehe nicht richtig es ist unglaublich hier in budapest mit einem so guten auto auf weichen reifen auf das podium gefahren zu sein das ergebnis ist auch zur ckzuf hren auf meine wesentlich verbesserte reaktionszeit am start das ist eigentlich das einzige woran wir gearbeitet haben
923791 ich habe ein bisschen hinter alonso festgesteckt dann bin ich vorbeigekommen und habe gl ck gehabt dass noch ein paar ausgeschieden sind so richtig gut lief es an diesem wochenende nicht weil wir den speed nicht umsetzen konnten aber wir sind sicherlich bald wieder ganz vorne mit dabei
923792 es h tte besser laufen k nnen heute keine ahnung was mit dem reifen passiert ist am ende ist wichtig dass ich immer noch in f hrung liege
923793 der start war nicht schlecht aber wir sind mit einer einstopp strategie gefahren und das auto war dann einfach zu schwer um weiter nach vorne zu fahren im gegensatz zu uns hat bei toyota heute das pendel weit nach oben ausgeschlagen das freut mich sehr f r ihn
923794 mit den finnen haben wir irgendwie gl ck f r massa tuts mir leid aber man muss eben bis ins ziel kommen unser timing hat perfekt gepasst um nach dem sp teren boxenstopp noch vor zu kommen der zweite platz f r timo glock ist aller ehren wert vor allem dass er kimi r ikk nen hinter sich halten konnte
923795 ein gro er sieg f r heikki die letzten runden ist er fantastisch gefahren lewis hat mit seinem plattfu nat rlich ein riesenpech gehabt er h tte wohl gewonnen wenn wir das fr her bemerkt h tten alles in allem war es ein starkes wochenende f r uns schade nur dass kein doppelerfolg herausgesprungen ist
923796 f r mich war es kein rennen zum vergessen sondern eines das wir in aller tiefe analysieren m ssen beide fahrer konnten zu keinem zeitpunkt normale rundenzeiten fahren das rennen ist komplett an uns vorbei gelaufen
923797 das hat timo verdient wir haben an toyota geglaubt und heute gesehen dass das richtig war wir haben gesagt dass wir 2010 weltmeister werden wollen und heute hat man gesehen dass das nicht realit tsfern ist toyota ist ein tolles team
923798 da in der wohnung ge ffnete beh ltnisse gefunden wurden scheint auch ein raubmotiv nicht ausgeschlossen

923859 yes you may be able to save some trout but there are subtle things that can go on that im not sure that fishermen think about
923860 if you look at pelican colonies around the west theyre kind of boom and bust
923861 these two colonies have had a lot of growth over the years but it was just a matter of time before they crashed
923862 from the data we have 80 to 90 percent of their diet is trash fish
923863 it kind of boils down between a fight between whats most important managing a species of greatest conservation need and appeasing the sportsmen that pay for managing the sport fish
923864 the pelicans have really lined up on the banks and rocks of the blackfoot river
923865 its not the ideal time to stock rainbow trout but its the only time to stock them and survive
923866 we are working against the clock not just politically but out there in the real world because every year that passes we get more invasions and those invasions stay forever

923868 you dont know what new or additional invasive species youll pick up
923869 there is no doubt that ballast water legislation that stems the tide of invasive species entering our waters from ships needs to be passed immediately

923881 the london times june 29 2001 muslims say fresco must be destroyed from
923882 merely depicting mohammads self ordained reward and thus natural itinerary really ya gotta love a cardinal actually called biffi
923883 the protesters said that giovanni da modena had shown muhammad being
923884 thrown into hell completely naked with a snake wrapped around his body and a demon next to him about to torture him
923885 anti muslim feeling in northern italy was inflamed last year when cardinal biffi claimed that a muslim invasion was threatening the values of christian europe
923886 absurd to suddenly discover after 600 years that our most famous treasure is offensive to the islamic religion
923887 ah but au contraire nothing is ever absurd illogical unreasonable and dangerous enough for millions of muslims worldwide from saying it demanding it and acting on it it defines their er faith
923888 there are half a million legally registered muslims many from north africa and about another 500 000 are thought to be living illegally in italy
923889 ah sadly the image of big and warm italian families is long gone via neo socialist assisted population collapse the italians have few kids thats unless one worships the peadophile rapist and bandit king then its 3 5 to 10 junior jihadists there is some good news from the great culture that gave us almost everything though and some of it is that there are muslims who agree with real italians and are thus perhaps italians if you can believe it but that aint it the sons of roma have maybe finally regained their famous balls and found their inner frank sinatra and um bulldozed a mosque and while throwing a bunch of egyptian islamists and assorted freaks out of the old country too islamists always like to give the free and open west an offer we apparently cant refuse no no that will never do wrong way round pally now the kicker is that a park will be built in place of the muslim laughing palace and yet another kicker it will be named the piazza oriana fallaci the saints be praised i loved that courageous great passionate and real italian woman oriana and obviously plenty of italians do too nel blu de pinto de blu fallaci de

923898 in the developing child methanol is known to cause birth defects memorandum and i am the impression that it has led to a sharp rise in autism in this country and other diet soda consuming countries around the world
923899 aspartame is quite tricky because it is mostly in sugar free things that i have avoided but if it is in other peoples homes you do not know quite what he has been granted

923936 he was one of the first people who spoke up about the inhumanity of stalins regime with a full voice and about the people whose lived through this but were not broken
923937 i have to say that alexander isayevich lived a very difficult but a very happy wife
923938 during the day everything related to the funeral and the wake will be settled and done in accordance to his will
923939 its been confirmed now that 11 people were killed in the accident its the worst one on any of our peaks
923940 it was raining very heavily and the crowds had swelled immensely and as soon as the rain stopped people tried to rush ahead
923941 there was a man with his child and he was shaking the child to see if he was alive and all the time tears were flowing down his cheeks
923942 no one from the police or administration was helping and it was just people helping each other in the pouring rain
923943 there was total chaos everywhere and i saw dead bodies everywhere and blood soaked survivors crying for help
923944 i am so shocked that i am trembling in my house and terrified to step out and go to work
923945 imi raspunde d ra cand intru in viteza in dormitor si o rog sa imi mingaie usor pieptul si capul pentru ca tocmai avusesem o ameteala cumplita din cauza variatiei de tensiune desi tocmai se oprise din citit era cu lumina aprinsa si nu dormea imi reaminteste ca si eu am refuzat sa ii masez spatele
923946 new short term and long term solutions to the energy crisis that were facing
923947 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good here
923948 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for moving us in the direction of energy independence then thats something im open to
923949 im not giving the gavel away to a tactic that supports the oil companies big oil at the cost and the expense of the consumer
923950 basically cools the passion of environmentalists knowing its not going anywhere while he is open to compromise on a comprehensive package that would achieve many other objectives
923951 barack obama says this weekend maybe eh and if but

923956 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate
923957 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
923958 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
923959 im excited its good to have him back in the house
923960 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
923961 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
923962 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
923963 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
923964 but like i said its not the first time and it wont be the last time
923965 if we played a game tomorrow aaron rodgers would be the starting quarterback
923966 im not going to change any direction that weve gone with this football team based on the information i have here today thats part of our conversation tomorrow and we have all the confidence in the world in aaron
923967 this is on the level of the 432 or the itanium

923969 i get really lost when im not working i dont know what im supposed to do with myself thank god for dance class and the new york times crossword puzzle and american idol but acting is what i really have to do
923970 you cannot persuade me there are not more disturbed or disgruntled persons with a political agenda in such a large group
923971 people given these kinds of responsibilities with this kind of power at their fingertips we have to make sure that they are not likely to do harm to others or misuse that authority be it intentionally or be it because of some mental problem
923972 these kinds of situations cry out for re examination of our standards
923973 they do risky things they drive fast they dont want to do anything that makes them look different and we make them look different we make them lose their hair we give them steroids that make them look puffy
923974 i felt like i was getting back at those guys who were keeping me from my friends and family
923975 for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
923976 the braves family and braves fans everywhere will sadly miss him our thoughts are with his wife paula and his children
923977 hes had some medical issues but youre never ready for something like this
923978 were all very shocked by the timing its a very sad day for family and for braves fans i think the braves fans feel theyre part of skips family
923979 he had a huge impact on a lot of peoples lives and he had a huge impact on my life
923980 during the season we spent more time together than we did with our families and our lives
923981 i know he wasnt feeling good but this was unexpected
923982 it takes time and privacy especially working out the methods which i wouldnt have guessed anyone really knew in the lab at that time
923983 its hard for me to conceive that the council wouldnt approve it
923984 the issue has been the biggest uncertainty i can remember in 24 years
923985 the entire industry has been in a quandary about where were going to be and if were going to be at all
923986 we lost a year in terms of building and creating something spectacular
923987 its not how i wanted to spend my time this year in court
923988 we recognize its a very ambitious approach but we still believe its feasible to get things opened by the 2008 season
923989 the village is making a mistake to vote on this
923990 conned by the threats that the horse show will leave town

923993 i would like to personally thank glenn straub whose cooperation and understanding made this announcement possible
923994 i believe in this vision and want to pass the baton to a new generation of equestrian ownership that will build a world class equestrian facility and bring a new level of u s and international equestrian appeal to wellington i decided i needed to take action to support this project and our community not only because it would stabilize all of our investments but because there are a great number of third party families and business owners getting hurt by this fight and thats just not right
923995 this is truly one of the most unique and impressive equestrian lifestyle communities in the world we have a number of options that we are considering and we are confident we can select a partner whose vision resources and international prominence will fully support the exceptional facility that we now own
923996 i think it would be almost irresponsible at this moment to really forge ahead without enough time to digest this new information
923997 i am reminded of sean connerys line in the untouchables that nobody should ever bring a knife to a gun fight
923998 wed like to be assured on sept 18 we will be able to have a full decision we are racing against a deadline

924005 he is a tremendous asset to the development and maintenance of a vital equestrian future for both wellington and the whole world of equestrian sport
924006 with the huge success of the recent rolex fei world cup finals in las vegas and the upcoming alltech fei world equestrian games in kentucky the attention on equestrian sport will be at an all time high and the development of the pbiec will not only benefit from these great events but will help to create a lasting high performance legacy for the sport in the u s and indeed worldwide

924046 then a thunderbolt pierced the charged atmosphere of the planet disrupting the tenuous tissue of gases forming the space between molten rock and heavy sky it discharged an immense quantum of energy just over the small plasma which was squashed by an accidental electron expelled by the blast that immediately disarranged and rearranged the atomic relationship of the plasma and surrounded it with a new and qualified environment not known until this very moment in this new havoc and as direct effect of the incredible amount of energy discharged plus the chaotic characteristics of earth at the moment this chance electron was capable of creating a frightful and wonderful new being now there was a mindless medium but alone floating in the atrocious surface of the planet there was life ready to climb up the stairs of evolution

924136 im an expert in this field ive identified a lot of pit bulls mainly from seeing pictures of them and reading about them in the newspaper and stuff i saw a film with a pit bull in it too i am a fully qualified pit bull spotter i did a course and i sat through the whole four hours of it so i know what im talking about yeah
924137 i know pit bulls and this is no pit bull a few clues that some of these web speculators have missed for one its not really got any fur on it pit bulls have a special fur that cant be torn off it was bred into them you know because they fight and stuff secondly its mouth is agape no pit bull would have an open mouth they have locking jaws which mean they clamp down and cant be prized open by humans most importantly its just like lying there all placid and stuff no way is that a pit all the pictures of pit bulls that ive seen tend to suggest that pit bulls dont just lie down to have their picture taken like this no way they are fearsome animals and legend has it they can even kill children who they havent even met yet just by thinking about them and clicking their back legs together this is no pit bull no way if you want my expert opinion its pretty obvious what this is its a turtle one of those teenage mutant ninja ones its not a pit no way i know what im talking about
924138 deze modus operandi is erg in bij het dievengilde kunnen we wel zeggen vorig jaar was dat nog echt het flipperen maar dat is hier in de afgelopen zeven maanden maar vijf keer voorgekomen
924139 overigens is het niet zo dat hierdoor nu vaker wordt ingebroken alleen zien we een enorme verschuiving in de manier waarop een woningkraak wordt gezet
924140 ook hier is het met name in een bepaalde wijk van deventer al een flinke tijd aan de gang we zitten er echt mee in onze maag
924141 het vervelende is dat ze heel snel te werk gaan en nauwelijks sporen achterlaten dat maakt het lastig om in de kiem te smoren
924142 we proberen ze op heterdaad te betrappen door patronen te zoeken en daarop te surveilleren maar ook hebben we een heel plan van aanpak gemaakt om mensen te waarschuwen zodat ze het de dieven moeilijker kunnen maken

924147 i sat next to this guy i felt really sorry for
924148 the team has built great camaraderie at the daily record whether we were up or down
924149 some years weve only been around 500 and last year we were one hit from getting in the championship
924150 theyre a good team and i knew they could sneak back
924151 im glad we didnt let it get to us kept our heads on us and made the plays when we needed to
924152 she took over today i was driving back from the outer banks from a wedding and she took over the helm for the day
924153 just glad that the team came through and this was a team effort
924154 if someone did something bad someone else was there to pick everyone up
924155 when i opened the paper on wednesday it was like reading about a death in a family
924156 it was more than an institution people felt close to the store from the time they walked in they were greeted and assisted but not overdoing it it had a very fine reputation all over ohio it was unique the associates or employees were all just one big happy family we didnt have a lot of turnover because people stayed with us
924157 i think the thing that sticks out most about the store to me was herman freedlander
924158 there are so many stories about him because he was such a colorful person he had a heart of gold and would do anything for anybody people would come in with no money and in need and hed give them clothes if someone died and a family member needed a suit he would fix them up he was just that kind of guy
924159 saturday before easter mother counted the money from her sugar bowl and excitedly announced she had enough with a little left over
924160 dad winked and urged her to hurry to freedlanders and added i sure hope that hat is still there
924161 we didnt have malls or things like that but anything you wanted suits clothes you went to freedlanders i was a stock boy part time and when i wasnt doing that i was playing santa its one experience in my life that ill never forget
924162 kids would go up there and you always expected them to be excited
924163 every once in a while youd get one whod see you and run the other way though it was a great job there are a lot of things youll never forget
924164 i remember going to town on saturday to shop for groceries stop at newberrys and freedlanders
924165 my parents would always let me visit the toy department at christmas it was always exciting to see santa and get my pin to wear on my coat showing that i visited santa at freedlanders
924166 it cant be a good thing to be the last of anything
924167 i think the generosity of the freedlander family is what sticks out in my mind about this store i never actually worked for the freedlanders but ive heard so many stories we have 125 years worth of them they never publicized all the good things that they did but the freedlanders supported a lot of people who needed help
924168 the thing about it was that if you didnt need the cake you didnt know about the tokens
924169 if i was on the third floor he was on the third floor checking on customers if i was on the first floor or the basement he was always right there my whole work ethic today is based on what i learned from him i just remember everybody was always so happy to see the customers it was truly customer service something you dont get these days the employees were so special they had so much pride in what they did and really enjoyed working at the store
924170 we always had one in the winter and one in the spring
924171 and they were real sale days they were special days people would call up to find out when those days were so they could arrange their vacations so they could come in and spend time shopping i didnt do any actual selling except on dollar day
924172 i was instructed that i would not be in there unless i was put to work so i did on those special sale days
924173 yesterday people were waiting here when we opened the doors
924174 i went to the mens department on wednesday to wait on people and one man said he was here to get lee jeans and that this was the only place he could get a particular size and style he said he had to stock up for the rest of his life because we wont be around anymore one man was in buying underwear because this was the only place he could get it so he said he was buying enough for the next 30 years thats the kind of thing weve been getting
924175 so thats what the little box that popped up on my screen was telling me to do
924176 how can i get another copy of obviously pirated software mine just died
924177 were really not the best people to talk to about that why dont you try calling the number on the box in which you bought it
924178 the philippines have english as their second language tagalog or filipino is their primary language all my students know how to speak english but the accent that they know are american or filipino english so they might not be able to pick up immediately some of the british or australian accent we would love to hear your voices from australia
924179 i remind my students that they are ambassadors representing their class school state country continent and hemisphere this is especially helpful when doing a recording since its sort of like live t v it was fun to see the smiles from the kids in hawksdale when they realized that the students in claret were in the audience students love working with students no matter what continent they are on
924180 the downward bias should continue and the market is likely to move within a range of 13 380 and 14 900 this week with no major positive trigger in sight
924181 the market may get some boost from the positive developments on the india us nuclear deal front but i think theres still miles to go before the agreement sees the light of the day
924182 there are only four days left so people were taking profits because they all know the start of the games means the end of any rebound
924183 the directors have considered the proposal and believe it undervalues the business
924184 in our opinion the indicative proposal of a 4 40 a share is a low balled bid that significantly undervalues asciano
924185 given all the noise around asciano many market participants have largely forgotten the strategic positioning and value of ascianos asset base and hence allowed the stock to trade down to levels well below fair value
924186 its iran again the iranian issue remains fluid and it looks like more sanctions will be imposed by the world powers and they will likely raise tensions over iran
924187 some reports are saying much of the us offshore oil production facilities are in the likely path of the storm but it is a little too early to say what the direction of the storm is going to be
924188 but to begin again to prepare sanctions resolutions for the u n security council
924189 mofaz a hawkish former defense minister and military chief is a top contender to succeed prime minister ehud olmert who announced last week he will resign in september amid a corruption probe
924190 youve got three supply side worries pushing oil higher today iran the storm and nigeria
924191 expectations for recovering earnings for banks were not high compared with last year when there were prospects for interest rate hikes
924192 flagging net operating profit higher credit costs and indications that profits will be disappointing ahead have continued exerting downward pressure on bank stocks
924193 maybe on the way back we will catch one of those bicycle cab rides they got
924194 all this walking has made me hungry where do you wanna eat now
924195 we always go to either mullens or merkles so i vote for mullens its closer
924196 there was never a deal put on the table that was compelling enough that we as the board could look the shareholders in the eyes and say this is a good deal for you
924197 i think youve overpaid for executive compensation overplayed your hand with microsoft and overstayed your welcome
924198 they can regain my confidence but theyre going to have to prove themselves first
924199 competition is good for the industry and for consumers so i am happy that microsoft did not succeed in acquiring yahoo
924200 yahoo has actively participated in these human rights abuses including the censorship of information and in one case turning over information to the chinese government
924201 i believe you are moral but the only morality you believe in is profit and self interest
924202 he is as some would say a good guy despite the bad things written about him we look forward to him being a productive member of the board
924203 we had to see where these kids were going to be today
924204 its easy to be up when youre winning ive played enough games to know that especially at this level youre going to get thumped at some point and youre going to thump someone we got thumped yesterday they key was how wed respond you have to stay level you cant get too high when you win or too low when you lose
924205 you have to score runs to mentally stay in things and i thought our mental approach was really good today
924206 we hit the ball well today i think our bats finally got here
924207 its a night game and we expect most of the town to be here supporting them
924208 we want to win the next three games because we want to play wednesday we know we have to do that tomorrow
924209 che fornisce gratuitamente le televisioni locali di programmi preconfezionati e sponsorizzati pronti per lemissione
924210 it does look like they have support of the shareholders again but at the end of the day they have to focus on the company goals and execute
924211 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honourable thing and step down from this board
924212 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
924213 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step
924214 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts
924215 a girlfriend who was involved in a break up is now trying to convince the world she was the initiator and not the victim
924216 this is a very global business and yahoo is very well positioned
924217 yahoo has a sad history of complicity with violating human rights by turning over information to the chinese government
924218 what we need to do is get our house in order
924219 icahn is in a better position to force some changes
924220 we decided to avoid a looming proxy battle with carl and frankly we are looking forward to working with him
924221 he is a smart guy and some say a good guy despite the things that are written about him

924234 web 2 0 changes seemed cool at first i could point out a few sites right off the bat but its getting kind of annoying im not really hyped up about web2 0 but i think its cool
924235 the rise in male anorexia actually masked a much bigger problem because men traditionally are less likely to seek help
924236 there has been a rise in focus on the body aesthetic and thats affecting men as well as girls
924237 clinics are seeing many more men as well as children as young as eight we know children are more likely to develop an eating disorder during puberty and puberty is starting on average five years earlier than it did 50 years ago
924238 has been one of the dark places of the earth

924241 the connection between religious intensity and political attitudes appears to be especially strong when it comes to issues such as abortion and homosexuality about six in ten americans who attend religious services at least once a week say abortion should be illegal in most or all cases while only about three in ten who attend less often share this view this pattern holds across a variety of religious traditions for instance nearly three in four 73 members of evangelical churches who attend church at least once a week say abortion should be illegal in most or all cases compared with only 45 of members of evangelical churches who attend church less frequently
924242 the foundations of national morality must be laid in private families john adams wrote in his diary in 1778 here adams was voicing an up to the minute theory of the republican family political thinkers imagined the american family as a factory specifically designed to turn out self governing citizens something quite different from what other kinds of families did they believed that the affectionate ties between spouses led to civic responsibility marriage based on individual choice would promote trust and equality that could then be projected into public life
924243 that the state has an interest in upholding the civil rights of individuals who want to marry doesnt mean that thats the only interest it has in the institution the state also has a strong even a life and death interest in marriage as the environment in which the next generation of its citizens is raised
924244 in other words they are simply advocating gay marriage but they have packaged it in a way that makes it appear more digestible
924245 overly and publicly critical of the church and her divinely appointed authorities
924246 it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea than that he should offend one of these little ones
924247 look when sherman stresses that the sea urchin has in expressed the genes for the eyes and for antibodies genes that are well known and fully active in later species how can we not agree with him that canonical neo darwinism cannot begin to explain such facts
924248 in every age it will be apparent to accurate thinkers that scientific theories being arrived at in the same way i have described are never statements of fact
924249 if ldsblog portals were truly interested in improving the visibility of faithful lds content on google they would be aware of search engine optimization and attempt to use their popularity to help the church in this regard
924250 since the advent of lds blog portals the official church websites have added numerous rss feeds if the portals were interested in building up the church and not just themselves they would find ways to incorporate and promote official church content
924251 that way blogs that only posted once a month or so would have their content up for longer that box has evolved with the need to include more and more blogs
924252 that being said i wonder why you dont simply open another box as opposed to having so many blogs in the bottom one
924253 never show your face anywhere in the bloggernacle ever again
924254 j max if you were at all sincere about withdrawing from the bloggernacle and indeed i long hoped you were you would never have posted your site as part of the largest bloggernacle aggregator there is now is the time for you to prove your sincerity and honesty by never showing your face anywhere in the bloggernacle ever again dont let the door hit you on the way out
924255 exploring the social political and intellectual possibilities of faithful mormonism
924256 never show your face anywhere in the bloggernacle ever again
924257 im very pleased to announce the birth of the mormon archipelago in order to continually add value to your blogging experience a group of high quality blogs have joined forces in a commonwealth as it were if you want to shop at target that is fine i enjoy it myself on ocassion but sometimes you need something more intimate and refined
924258 besides the cool logo and grouped links we are working on a consolidated rss feeds for our menus and for your syndicating pleasure you can look forward to guest blogging and wonders that have yet to be revealed to the children of men
924259 in the meantime well have to live without recent comments and the other goodies i know youre thinking give me convenience or give me death ill see what i can do for you the convenience part that is
924260 the new home page for the mormon archipelago www ldsblogs org go check it out and let me know what you think
924261 the purpose of the new site is to be a useful central place to see whats going on at all of the best blogs in the bloggernacle we hope it will continue to grow more useful over time
924262 not discriminate on the basis of sex orientation nationality or content if you are a latter day saint in any way or associated with lds i will be glad to aggregate your blog irregardless of your doctrinal position
924263 of course connections matter that is how networks work the guys at the ji have amazing content and many bloggers have met them in real life i e they are real people always a question in blogging what more they are exemplary in many many ways why wouldnt we want to move them up
924264 never show your face anywhere in the bloggernacle ever again
924265 any possibilities in the future for user centered edits such as removing a certain blog that i dont care to see posts for
924266 on what basis have you selected these blogs and not others i know youre considering my blog thinking in a marrow bone but i wonder why a compared to these other blogs it is not already included and b why it is something that you are considering as compared to already decided
924267 open criticism of or opposition to the brethren by any of the regular bloggers or by a visible number of commentators is a disqualifying attribute
924268 they dont seem to realize that when they hurl the word divisive out there they have drawn a line themselves
924269 no one is being forced to stand anywhere they dont want to
924270 never show your face anywhere in the bloggernacle ever again
924271 do all you can to support the proposed constitutional amendment by donating of your means and time to assure that marriage in california is legally defined as being between a man and a woman
924272 changing the institution of marriage as it is presently understood between a man and a woman
924273 this puts lds members who support barack obama in an uncomfortable position
924274 do you support affiliate with or agree with any group or individual whose practices or teachings are contrary to or oppose those accepted by the church of jesus christ of latter day saints
924275 can cast off a direct request by the first presidency of the church with such nonchalance
924276 the violence already committed against the coherence of the restored gospel by your own intellectual contortions
924277 so and so was for abortion so we dont vote for them
924278 this doesnt seem to just apply to anti and polygamy clans
924279 a vote for obama despite whatever other merits he may have in other realms of policy may not be easily reconcilable with the churchs exhortation to
924280 given that the vote on the california marriage amendment is the same day as the presidential election im wondering how anyones vote for president will have any impact on the passage of the amendment
924281 many pro obama supporters who are more thoughtful of these issues than you seem to be giving credit
924282 never show your face anywhere in the bloggernacle ever again
924283 here the residents are doing their job and they assume allieds doing theirs
924284 we acknowledge that fact and we want to make that right but to the tune of 1 8 million we wouldnt agree with that
924285 shes had a really good life though much better than she would have had
924286 you look to see how wide they are and make sure they arent stiff legged you want clear eyes
924287 they have tons of personality when she wants to play she gets all jumpy
924288 you understand itll go all along its in the back of your mind but its still hard
924289 but if you buy from here you know its healthy you know theyve been treated well
924290 fortunately we dont have a lot of these claims at least of this scope
924291 it was obvious that his call was not work related as he was having a jolly good time laughing
924292 wanted our officers to set a good example for others to follow
924293 it would be difficult for us to enforce a law if we violate it
924294 after the law went into effect i overheard some officers saying yeah but were exempt
924295 we made sure that they realized that the only exemption was for emergency business and nevertheless it set a negative image having officers on a cell phone when the public is prohibited
924296 their first reactions were thats not fair and why is it ok for police and not the rest of us
924297 can i take down their car number and report them
924298 there are a million and one reasons why officers need cell phones
924299 without them they would have to go into the station over and over again thereby taking them off the street
924300 obviously i am upset and worried for my familys safety in the future
924301 once we rebuild our house and move back in i dont know what more we can do
924302 i dont think the university can do too much to prevent these kind of attacks i would like to see the citizens of santa cruz and our elected officials including the mayor step up and condemn this kind of violence
924303 if their father is willing to continue risking his livelihood in order to continue chopping up animals in a laboratory then his children are old enough to recognize the consequences
924304 this guy knows what he is doing he knows that every day that he goes into the laboratory and hurts animals that it is unreasonable not to expect consequences
924305 to put this on par with any of the human rights issues is an absolute insult to the integrity of the people who fought and went through the human rights movement
924306 this is what people do when they have an inability to articulate their point in any constructive way they resort to primal acts of violence any reasonable person would need a logic transplant to begin to understand this level of degraded thinking
924307 animal abusers everywhere beware we know where you live we know where you work we will never back down until you end your abuse
924308 i question a lot about whether these people really care as much about the cause as they do about bringing notoriety to themselves
924309 we understand their frustration we understand why they are doing that sort of thing
924310 there is still some way to go still some distance between the unions position and ours but this is a step in the right direction towards what we hope will be an amicable solution i dont believe a strike is in anybodys best interests and hopefully with good will on both sides industrial action can be avoided
924311 we want this issue to be resolved as quickly and amicably as possible this is a major step to take things forward
924312 i am gobsmacked for 10 years we have been doing major events but this has probably been the most exciting and enjoyable
924313 we are fully booked we have 23 rooms and its been booked up for a while were putting it down to the status quo gig
924314 our hotel filled up quite quickly our 21 rooms booked up straightaway the majority are going to the gig
924315 once tickets went on sale the eight rooms were taken pretty quickly
924316 weve played all over the world but its nothing to do with statistics venue and size its more about the people and the vibes thats what makes it work for us
924317 if we knew the secret of how to make it happen it would happen all the time but from what weve heard about whitehaven and you cumbrians we hope we definitely will get the vibes up there and it will be fantastic we know its an important occasion for whitehaven we just hope we can live up to it and everybody has a great time
924318 this is very different from the events we have done in the past and a complete first for whitehaven we want people to come along and enjoy the concert and the experience its an opportunity to show the town in a good light for its 300th anniversary
924319 if youre an owner looking to renovate theres no profit potential there
924320 the last thing someone should have to do when they move into a brand new home is make a bunch of costly repairs
924321 this term you will have studied the various world views and belief systems underlying the organisation of societies and the way power is excercised over various groups within societies you will learn to recognise these philosiphies and world views in texts

924452 they may not be eliminated or abrogated by the legislature or by the electorate through the statutory initiative process
924453 their family relationship accorded the same respect and dignity enjoyed by an opposite sex couple
924454 denying such couples access to the familiar and highly favored designation of marriage is likely to cast doubt on whether the official family relationship of same sex couples enjoys dignity equal to that of opposite sex couples
924455 i think gender should be a suspect class but as things stand it isnt so the california supreme court has decided give sexual orientation a higher status than gender i think that shows a problem in the legal reasoning of the court at least to a small degree

924481 one dutch was rescued by helicopter from k2 this morning while an italian is still at an altitude of 7 200 metres
924482 our four high altitude porters left a while ago and it is expected that they will bring the italian climber down this evening
924483 the three mountaineers who survived are suffering from severe frostbite
924484 they are badly affected and it appears that at least one of them would have his hand and leg chopped off this is what our high altitude doctors believe
924485 the rope collapsed and the climbers started falling in various directions some fell in neighbouring china some in pakistan

924508 top tier religious leaders in the muslim world are emerging as major proponents of dialogue with christians and other world faiths with two distinct initiatives this month they are breaking new ground and sending signals to muslims and others globally that interreligious understanding and joint action are islamic values
924509 those involved see the initiatives if sustained as breaking down misperceptions strengthening mainstream religious voices on the world stage and diminishing the influence of extremism
924510 this week yale university hosts the first of four meetings between prominent muslim and christian leaders from across the globe with discussions rooted in foundational principles of the two faiths
924511 it follows a separate initiative held earlier in july in madrid called by king abdullah of saudi arabia who surprised the world by urging 200 muslims christians jews and people of eastern religions to gather together for purposes of dialogue and reconciliation while some people expressed skepticism because of the saudi kingdoms continued restrictions on other faiths many conferees were encouraged
924512 when the king says publicly that diversity is a sacred notion in islam thats a big deal
924513 the christian response was positive leading to planning for four conferences muslims with protestant leaders in new haven conn this week with anglicans at cambridge university in october with catholics at the vatican in november and finally at georgetown university in washington next spring where the social and political implications of the dialogues will come to the fore
924514 the 150 leaders participating include evangelical and mainline protestants i e president of the national association of evangelicals muslims from several continents sunni sufi and shiite including ayatollahs from iran and a few jewish leaders
924515 well isnt that special its just too damn bad that mohammad revealed from allah that christians are blaspheming infidels who will surely go to hell for the sin of shirk but on a positive note if christians actually come to believe that their cursed faith in a triune god will be respected by muslims and this lulls them into a sense of false security then thats all the better preparation for the day when al mahdi wipes them off the face of the planet not to mention the jews those descendants of apes

924558 people move here for two reasons economic opportunity and amenities and jobs have dominated that equation for years now were not creating jobs unemployment is rising
924559 weve developed a dependency on that growth through our tax system
924560 a reduction in growth is tied to a number of things in our economy

924577 you have a large number of employers and a transient workforce and multiple job sites and a project by project dynamic so the jobs are here today and then theyre done and an industry that is fiercely competitive

924579 unions are trying to organize the company so theyre trying to discredit the company and saying we dont have safety
924580 that makes it a lot easier for the union to come in and say were here and were going to protect employees

924626 the labour party is to be commended for introducing this bill because it has brought the issue into sharp focus as deputy andrews stated the government is responsible for being a little tardy in dealing with this issue it puts it up to us as to whether we are prepared to legislate to grant equality to all citizens

924706 the human skeletons as well as the associated artifacts such as pottery ornaments and food remains like shells and animal bones are currently being analyzed in order to extract more information about the burials and lifestyles of the ancient people who lived in the niah subis region during that time
924707 given the continued reliance on nevirapine containing art regimens in africa together with the important role tuberculosis services play as an entry point for art further prospective studies exploring this outcome are warranted
924708 one of the most striking aspects of our study was the demonstration that 40 percent of patients starting art in recent years have concurrent tuberculosis underscoring the public health importance of improving affordable treatment options for patients infected with hiv and tuberculosis in this setting
924709 he hasnt got many other tricks left in his locker he will need to have a cabinet reshuffle and he will need to make a success of the economic relaunch he has got planned otherwise the cabinet will be under heavy pressure to act the crunch time will be late this month
924710 there has been a lamentable confusion of tactics and strategy
924711 they just see it as trendy because people talk about it
924712 unfortunately they glamorise it but theres nothing glamorous about losing your teeth and your hair and the sores
924713 on an average on a daily basis cancellation as affected about ten rooms so on an average about a lakh a day has been lost for the last five to seven days i dont think you can take it as a loss it is postponement of this kind of a business of source ome might not come but a majority of them will come back
924714 we may have to accept less than we wanted if this happens i will be disappointed but a stake in the company of 30 per cent or so still is very useful for us
924715 i had to sacrifice many things i am staying in bangalore from past three years and i havent gone to school i only go to school to give my exams i have stayed away from my home even but i knew in order to win an entry in olympic i have to make these sacrifices and i am happy with my decision

924723 nature has endowed the great white shark with more than enough bite force to kill and eat large and potentially dangerous prey
924724 pound for pound the great whites bite is not particularly impressive but the sheer size of the animal means that in absolute terms it tops the scales it must also be remembered that its extremely sharp serrated teeth require relatively little force to drive them through thick skin fat and muscle
924725 oh but im not really doing anything with any of these issues even though im happy to discuss them and have my opinions
924726 he steve noticed the slightest traces of mortar adhering to pieces of flint in a field near st peters pit and michael and i followed up this sighting with a radar survey of the field
924727 the results were spectacular not only did they locate the building but the radar showed that it survived in very good condition and was quite large not a simple cell or room but something that resembled a small church
924728 it was probably built in the early 12th century and underwent a number of changes in ground plan
924729 one particularly exciting find is a large section of the south wall of the church which collapsed inwards probably when the building was being dismantled for building materials in the 16th century
924730 we have also found small pilgrim badges which indicates that the place was visited by pilgrims on their way to walsingham
924731 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks

924740 the punjab government is providing all kind of assistance to the relatives of victims for transportation of bodies from bhai jaitta civil hospital here
924741 however a large number of prior reports have demonstrated that because of issues of social instability related to illicit drug addiction hiv infected idus may not be deriving the full benefits of haart
924742 although our findings cannot be generalized outside of this cohort as efforts to improve use of haart among idus expand the fact that survival patterns were not significantly different between idus and non idus should help to challenge the increasingly prevalent belief that idus may be markedly less likely to benefit from haart
924743 based on these results we conclude that haart regimens may have effectiveness at a populational level that is not significantly different regarding the survival of individuals with and without a history of injection drug use
924744 the meetings can be a bit lively but what he ferguson is doing is in the interests of manchester united if he wants to keep the player hell do everything he can to do so and hell probably succeed
924745 what wayne did last season was staggering he played out of position a lot he played on the left and sacrificed himself so many times for the team i know the manager wants to see wayne playing in his more accustomed position just off the front maybe that will happen if we sign a striker and then youll see how dangerous he can be

924870 i would like to apologise to both the parents and family of heidi murphy for what i have done which caused her death
924871 my intention was only to steal because i was pushed by economic needs and the result of that burglary was meant to buy a ring and to fund my marriage
924872 i did that because both of my parents could not afford to give me this and i didnt expect at all that the incident would be something like this
924873 by gods name i didnt have any intention to do this
924874 in this criminal case the defendant clearly had no intention and purpose to kill so that sentence demanded by the prosecutor is unacceptable
924875 i admit to all my mistakes and i realise that my action has violated law which the consequence is jail for me
924876 i surrender mr judge even though it feels so heavy the punishment that i must bear because im aware that this is definitely not as sad as has been felt by both parents and the family of heidi murphy for losing the person they loved
924877 im also aware that my action has tainted and slander bali image as tourist destination
924878 please honorary judges consider being a little bit more lenient with me so that i can have the chance to improve my life and so that i can do good deeds to others for now and for the future
924879 i also beg and ask for the greatest forgiveness from the parents and family of heidi murphy who have lost their most loving daughter
924880 i also offer an apology to my own parents for causing this very deep pain
924881 i didnt know anything about the murder i only knew about the burglary

924883 if we werent always late to church this wouldnt happen
924884 what weve seen is other banks move away from closing branches so its certainly created competition
924885 and so i am very sorry for sending you to jail for so long it was bad for me to do this
924886 what do you mean this is good how could it be good that i sent my friend to jail for a year
924887 if i had not been in jail i would have been with you
924888 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose

924895 i think its great that she is representing our country and i hope she continues to make us proud she definitely has my support
924896 its tough for a kid you know theres a lot of pressure coming from the community and your peers its a pretty heavy load when your whole country is rooting for you to succeed and represent the entire race its not an easy show thats for sure
924897 well of course its a different era back then there werent too many child performers now theres a lot of them out there who are starting out so great its good that we now have media tools such as the internet youtube myspace etc whereas back in the days we strictly relied on print radio and tv to get recognition

924906 we do know we have no systemic problem in this company
924907 i mean we are still probably the safest airline flying around
924908 i am quite sure that things are talked about continual issues cause some reputational damage
924909 it is our job to make sure we get that reputation back
924910 were a very very conservative company we turn back on just about everything and so we should thats the way weve operated over so many years
924911 and by the way that is why we do have such a good record and that record is still very very good
924912 it was quickly rectified and there were no safety implications at any time
924913 we experience these sorts of delays right across our business
924914 the pre flight inspections are done as part of the safety systems within qantas and every other airline for that matter for this exact reason to find anything the crew or the engineers are not happy with
924915 there are so many potential problems that can be picked up before the aircraft is in the air it was a hydraulic leak a very routine event
924916 it shows that the safety system is working as it should in fact we should all be encouraged that the systems are working well
924917 we ought to get extra we worked through the heat of the day not like these lazy latecomers

924941 one of the reasons for conspiracy theories is an assumption that people in high places always know what they are doing when they do something that makes no sense devious reasons are imagined by conspiracy theorists when in fact it may be due to plain old ignorance and incompetence

924944 with the writers strike it took so long to get underway and roger avary the writer had a commitment that was in line before working the wolfenstein stuff but ive recently been in contact with roger and hes actually working on the script right now
924945 i think that from a progress standpoint its probably gone a little bit slower than what we would have expected you cant control these strikes and so on
924946 theres some contract provisions and if they dont have certain things done within a certain period of time they cant just sit on the rights forever and not use them
924947 but apart from that me kind of nagging on him hey is it done yet hey is it done yet
924948 its a tossup whether i check gamesindustry biz or make my morning coffee first as both are essential to my early morning routine i find gamesindustry biz a key component of my research with the sites editors and reporters breaking news stories more often than any of its competitors
924949 that may be in the future in the near term we want to launch these with great customization and a great library of accessories this fall i think there is a lot more we can do with them
924950 do you have any details on how new items will roll out will that be microtransactions
924951 no there wont be any microtransactions for costumes and clothing
924952 when we launch it were going to have a bevy of clothing and accessories and what we hope to get into is a regular cadence of new avatar items and what were going to work on next up after weve wrapped up this new xbox experience is how were going to package up these things so that we can have our publishers and third parties able to deliver add ons for the avatars so thats what we hope to have next year
924953 when we launch this fall all of the items certainly will be free on avatars
924954 i check gamesindustry biz every day you have to to know whats going on its definitely the best european news site and is beginning to offer a more global view too theres a ton of information and news on the net but this is the one that matters
924955 obviously as the publisher they had to know what was going on but their internal structure probably wasnt in the right place to buy things at the time
924956 and theyre a single format ok xbox is doing fantastically but who knows whats going to happen in the future
924957 we just got to the point where we were looking forward the club took us about a year to sign up a year is a long time when youve got 50 staff sitting there twiddling their thumbs in early development stages because obviously the publisher has quite an influence into what type of game is made
924958 weve got a lot of money in the bank but that used to be five years worth of money and then three years worth of money
924959 were not big business people we didnt get into the games industry to be all powerful all expanding it got to the point where we werent enjoying it
924960 gamesindustry biz is essential reading i read it daily as my main online source of information about the european games market operating in a fast changing global business i have to have up to date reliable information gamesindustry biz is a great resource the team are highly professional and well regarded

924964 we didnt play well and i think on a perfect pitch we would still have struggled
924965 we lacked the concentration and the overall effort needed to put boland away
924966 it was as if we were going through the motions we went to boland with the aim of picking up the bonus point but we let ourselves down through countless errors
924967 we havent seen our scrum lose ball like that for a long time
924968 we were terrible at the breakdown and really missed guys like heinrich brussow and hendro scholtz zolani mofu and frankie horne caused us plenty of problems in this area

925030 the neuroscientists idea of a game is rock paper scissors which is zero sum whereas economists have focused on strategic games that produce gains through collaboration
925031 from moment to moment the hedonimeter varies the delicate index now flickering with the flutter of the passions now steadied by intellectual activity low sunk whole hours in the neighbourhood of zero or momentarily springing up towards infinity
925032 economics became a deductive science because we didnt have the tools to gather information inductively now better statistical tools and neuroscience are opening up the possibility that economics can become an abductive science that combines elements of deductive and inductive reasoning
925033 curiosity about neuroscience among economists has outstripped what we have to say for now
925034 blood flow is an indirect measure of what goes on in the head a blunt instrument
925035 in many areas of economics it will dominate because it works

925064 who use islam for their own devilish and selfish motives
925065 we the ulama muslim professionals and traditional leaders have come together to declare that islam is a religion of peace harmony and compassion we the silent majority are saddened and pained every time islam is painted and portrayed as a religion of the sword and intolerance by those who do not belong to the faith and even by some who proclaim themselves as followers of the faith it is disheartening that some people who want to give a wrong impression of islam simply select a few words from the quran distort them and put them in the wrong context all in order to show that islam supports violence and evil motives
925066 the time has come for the muslim ummah peace loving citizens to condemn those impostors who use islam for their own devilish selfish motives
925067 there shall be no compulsion in religion indeed truth has been made manifest distinct
925068 may only be imposed in an islamic state or by a duly constituted authorities or government entities with certain conditions and limitations

925105 were really excited with the turn out for this important online gaming data gathering study with other 1000 participants we will meet all quotas for a statistically significant sample which will guarantee the legitimacy of our online gaming study data this is absolutely key to professors liberty kubis and simone cuthill who will be collating the results
925106 i loved the opportunity to meet and greet the online gaming survey takers and speak to them one on one i want to get the most accurate and colorful data possible for my work also i want to get personal ideas and view points that will offer some important perspective about the level of online gaming integration in our society
925107 im very excited about tallying the data from this important online gaming survey
925108 this is the first time weve asked for public participation in our scientific research and were absolutely flattered and grateful by the turn out i expect preliminary results will be tabulated by next month at which point well release general findings about important online gaming trends in this society to the local media
925109 for those surveyees that took part in all three of the online gaming survey sections we offered three different forms of compensation a cash gift of 50 gift certificate to a local restaurant or a gift card for the upcoming holiday season at the local mall

925112 i was impressed with the publics awareness of online gaming trends in their daily lives ive been studying them for months now and some surveyees raised questions that i couldnt readily answer in those cases i referred them to write their comments down and submit them to our directors for further review
925113 usually i just sign off on results and make sure they are published in a timely matter but this time i really wanted to get hands on with this online gaming subject matter so i decided to aide my fellow employees with statistical measurements and data analysis personally im very curious about local online gaming ideas and trends

925165 from the data we have 80 to 90 percent of their diet is trash fish

925275 bila sudah mengenal cinta maka nanti belajar kita akan terganggu
925276 boleh boleh saja salam tapi neng nama panggilannya khawatir salam dariku itu ada buntutnya
925277 ketika kerinduanku muncul pada siapa aku harus mengadu rasanya anginpun tak ingin menyapaku hampa rasanya hati ini cintaku bertepuk sebelah tangan kasih jangan salahkan aku bila suatu saat aku mengatakan rindu cintaku kepadamu lama aku tunggu dirimu seakan tak kenal lelah diriku sudah tidak berdaya lagi namun rinduku belum juga terbalas apakah ini yang dinamakan cinta
925278 bila engkau sudah punya cinta mengapa engkau biarkan aku merindukan dirimu mengapa engkau buat aku jatuh cinta kau buat diriku tersiksa selama lamanya lama aku tunggu dirimu cintamu namun engkau begitu angkuh dengan kecantikanmu kau buat aku terlena tak berdaya
925279 kutahu kau sudah ada yang punya neng aku sudah berusaha untuk menghilangkan rasa cinta ini sekarang apa kau sudah mau bertemu lagi denganku berbicara lagi denganku bila itu yang kau inginkan aku kan korbankan apa yang kau inginkan mau termasuk cinta ini bila itu yang kau mau asalkan engkau bahagia dan mau dekat denganku
925280 aku mencintaimu dengan sangat sederhana dengan kata yang tak pernah sempat diucapkan kayu kepada api yang menjadikannya abu aku ingin mencintaimu dengan sederhana dengan isyarat yang tak sempat disampaikan awan kepada hujan yang menjadikannya air
925281 hasrat cinta yang lama kurasakan kuharap tumbuh dengan mekar subur bersama musim yang membawa mawar yang warna warni itu namun musim subur yang kuharafkan tidak muncul muncul juga yang datang hanyalah musim gugur dengan kerikil kerikil tajam yang menusuk hati ini sehingga kering tak tersiram
925282 sebelum aku mengungkapkan kepada ia ada seseorang temanku sekelas yang menyukainya bahkan jauh sebelum aku mengungkapkan hal itu
925283 bila kau tahu betapa aku mencintaimu mungkin engkau tak akan pernah membenciku aku memang tidak punya apa apa hanyalah cinta yang aku punya bila cinta ini aku berikan kepada sembarang orang tidak ada lagi harta yang aku miliki akan aku jaga cinta ini akan aku berikan cinta ini kepada kasih yang benar benar mengharafkan dan membutuhkannya tidak akan aku lepas cinta ini kepada durjana dan pengkhianat pengkhianat cinta tak akan aku berikan kepada oang orang yang tak menghargai akan betapa luhurnya cinta
925284 jika saya sampai mencium pacar saya maka saya berani bertanggung jawab untuk menikahi pacar saya
925285 sungguh diriku telah tersesat karena cinta sebagai harta berharga miliku telah aku berikan kepada orang yang tidak menghargainya
925286 seiring dengan suara alam yang terdengar awal pagi kelap aku menulis kata kata yang tidak bisa aku ungkapkan kepadamu hati gelisah rindu dan rasa cinta yang kian hari bertambah harus ke mana ke siapa kerinduan ini aku curahkan
925287 belum siap untuk menerimaku untuk berpacaran dan takut memutuskan harapanku atau di balik itu apakah memang engkau tidak sama sekali mencintaiku aku ngerti yang demikian itu demi persahabatan biarlah aku korbankan cinta ini jika memang itu yang kau harafkan kenapa hati ini sampai tersiksa aku mengharaf janganlah engkau dan orang lain mengalaminya perlu engkau sadari betapa sulitnya aku untuk menghilangkan rasa cinta ini cinta yang sudah lama tumbuh tak mudah untuk menghilang begitu saja
925288 mungkin ini suatu kebetulan dan memang ya masing masing tuhan telah mengatur segalanya jika memang takdir mungkin ini yang harus aku terima
925289 lebih baik bersahabat saja dari pada berpacaran jika memang itu lebih baik akan aku jalani apa yang akan aku hadapi tanpa sepi lagi kesepian itulah diriku tanpa dirimu di hati ini dan seharusnya begitulah diriku dari pada harus menanggung beban perasaan cinta dalam bayangan bayangan saja oh tuhan sadarkanlah diriku
925290 sekarang tidak ada lagi yang harus ku tangisi tidak ada lagi yang harus aku sesali kenangan tinggalah sebuah kenangan senyuman itulah sebuah masa depan payah susah kalau memang itu sebuah gambaran tataplah masa depan dengan penuh semangat mudah muddahan semua itu mendapat imbalan yang berimbang di sisi tuhan
925291 aku adalah orang dhaif tapi aku ingin berbakti kepada mu dan aku tidak mau tersesat
925292 mungkin aku keliru telah mencintaimu kini aku sadar betapa jauhnya mengharaf bintang di langit aku hanya bias melihat gemerlapnya dan menikmati indahnya kilauan bintang nan jauh di sana sementara diriku tidak mampu untuk membawanya kehadapanku namun dengan begitu aku telah merasakan seakan engkau ada di dekatku dan itulah yang menjadikan kerinduan ini selalu hadir beribu ribu berjuta juta kata yang tergoreskan walaupun khayalan anganan dan impian itu semua tidaklah mungkin mengobati luka di dalam hati yang merindu ini
925293 kini harus aku akui aku bukanlah siapa siapa melainkan aku
925294 bila memang masih ada cinta untukku siapa di mana da dari mana itu adanya aku ingin berkata
925295 banyak orang tertawa tapi aku beredih orang bahagia tapi aku merana orang lain saling membagi rasa tapi aku tidak
925296 kini hilanglah harapan harapanku jalan yang aku tempuh sangat berliku liku tak seorangpun ingin tahu apa yang aku rasakan aku akui jalan yang aku tempuh memang salah
925297 im really pleased to accept this degree when i started my career as a professional footballer i didnt envisage that one day id be made master of arts i grew up in salford and its been a big part of my life for 30 years so its great to be a part of salford university now
925298 we are delighted to present this degree to ryan it is not only his great achievements on the pitch for which he deserves recognition but for his valuable charity work with developing countries
925299 prison staff are genuinely worried for blake and amys management are happy because they feel she needs to move out of town
925300 a studio flat would serve the purpose of sticking your head down for a couple of nights while visiting
925301 there are lots of little modern flats in the town which are low maintenance

925306 aku tahu selanjutnya kau akan lebih nyaman tanpa aku kau tak perlu memaksakan datang jika aku minta ditemani atau mendengarkan cerita ceritaku yang membosankan
925307 tidak aku bukan orang seperti yang kau pikir aku hanya lukisan yang disobek pembuatnya dan percuma kau menatapku teliti yang akan kau lihat hanya wajah seseorang yang kau pikirkan bukan wajahku sendiri
925308 ada sebagian orang yang mampu mengundang napas ke atas kanvas dengan tangan dan cintanya seperti yang selama ini kau percaya
925309 haha tak mungkin tak ada hal semacam itu yang perlu kau temui adalah mahluk dari jenismu yang memahami ilmu jiwa lagipula kenapa kamu sampai dirobek pembuatmu sendiri kenakalan apa yang kau telah perbuat

925315 kau harus segera melakukannya kau harus melakukannya dengan suka cita

925317 throughout the investigation and prosecution of this case the anc president has had his rights repeatedly violated by institutions of state
925318 the incidence extent scope and costs associated with crime are increasing this alone reflects the societal changes which are taking place
925319 since our last survey the level of crime perpetrated against small business has increased by 11 per cent the business community is under constant attack from planned professional criminality
925320 there is an enormous psychological price being paid by business people as crime is now more organised more professional more ruthless and more pervasive

925322 recent data on drug trends in this country show that teens see abusing prescription drugs and over the counter medicines as safer than street drugs in fact nationwide teen abuse of prescription drugs is on the rise while the use of street drugs such as heroin or marijuana is declining
925323 and i listen and i think time doesnt seem to pass here it just is a remarkable place altogether
925324 this period has been the best time of my life
925325 the main target here is to prove that palestine exists to have a flag among all the other flags of the world
925326 if the israelis have a bad memory i will say only that we have many more of them from 1948

925336 be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of god
925337 train up a child in the way he should go even when he is old he will not depart from it
925338 you shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up
925339 i have always found that when i have played against yorkshire they have always played it hard but very fair
925340 my first ever ball in first class cricket was from arnie sidebottom
925341 they were fair here as well led by darren gough
925342 there are lots of emotions i got my first 100 here and i remember it very clearly to get my 100th here seems like fate
925343 its impossible to put a 20 goals prediction on any player but what we know is that if we give him a couple of chances he will score goals
925344 im confident he will score but its difficult to predict how many
925345 he has shown in pre season and in other games last season that not only can he score he can score two or three in a game thats an asset any team needs
925346 hes got an instinct and a composure in front of goal he likes the challenge of the premier league and of coming up against defenders so i think the league games will bring even more out of him
925347 afonsos attitude to preseason has been excellent he was quite cool about the goals he scored at hibs but im sure he will be quite chuffed to get a couple before the start of the season
925348 it was a good work out i have learnt a lot from the game so in that sense it was a really good exercise
925349 we had johnson and alves on the bench and to know that we have got impact substitutions to alter the course of the game like that is pleasing we didnt really have that last season
925350 i so like her shes an example for the guys shes like a crazy worker without stop thats very good motivation
925351 ive always wanted for the olympic games to feel im going into it feeling good and ready
925352 they have to know that put that aside and still push ahead anyway you have to understand shes dianne never seen elyse compete outside canada and almost outside this province
925353 it makes me so proud that i can finally give something back to them
925354 they can go somewhere that they havent been before and they get to watch me at the same time so thats really great
925355 when youre younger everythings a lot easier you weigh less youre strong
925356 just the ratios of strength to body weight type thing
925357 it really is a competition the judges are all there they run it strictly by time you present you do your one routine you move on
925358 being in gymnastics was a perfect sport for me because its all about that one moment in front of the judges
925359 all the preparation its important but not as important as those seconds that youre on the apparatus
925360 in guyana our wireless revenue decline reflects the continued impact of competition that entered the market in late 2006 and a decline in subscribers from 305 000 as of june 2007 to 277 000 as of june 2008
925361 on the fixed line side of our business we were pleased to see another quarter of growth we increased the access lines in service in guyana had strong increases in high speed data subscribers in the virgin islands and guyana and continued to add business customers in vermont and new hampshire
925362 if you dont use your treatment right it causes resistance resistance is the major headache the major worry you have what will happen to your population should there be resistant strain viruses out there being transmitted we dont know we dont have the resources in testing that because i mean it is very expensive
925363 after that we would take the list to all the other treatment sites to see if the persons are accessing treatment
925364 we have realised that patients would have given us incomplete address incorrect addresses wrong names and wrong telephone numbers and that is a problem a major problem
925365 we tried it departmentally to see if it was going to work but in a way people were a bit hesitant to come forward but that is one of the ways we would have to go
925366 but you cant do that with hiv treatment because what you do you develop drug resistance you are going to die faster
925367 if you are having unprotected sex a lot of people are still have unprotected sex even though they are hiv infected and they keep re infecting themselves and others
925368 defaulting on treatment having unprotected sex they are exposing other people to resistant strain viruses meaning that those persons they infect from day one the treatment would not work
925369 when we asked them they admitted having unprotected sex and those who transmitted to partners we started them on first line treatment and over a three month period we did not see any improvement and we did not want to waste time anymore we have already started them on second line treatment
925370 so you have to deal with more issues and more problems when you are on second line treatment
925371 you can be walking down the street and people coughing and you dont know what form of tb they have
925372 you can be sitting on an aircraft and someone having resistance tb coughs and you can become infected
925373 the mere thought of having those type of cases it is a public health alarm because we need to make sure that we get those patients
925374 we had about eleven cases from what i was told five of them died so at least we have about four or five of them still alive and we dont know they would have been infected since
925375 but i always tell patients if they had to go to the us embassy or had to go somewhere else they would have found that money to go
925376 as long as that initial two months pass you can have two months five months sometimes six months treatment depending on their cd4 count
925377 i am sure that there are prominent people in this country who have hiv who can stand up on the bandwagon and start talking about hiv the government is making an excellent contribution but people need a role model and it is not happening
925378 we can refer it to them but it has to be concrete
925379 they said they saw him at the top with his briefcase and then he slid down the chute and walked away as though nothing happened
925380 well i dont know for sure i have not been focusing on them
925381 what about if they have been saving the government money you never check on that
925382 i dont know why they are taking a hands off approach
925383 they are afraid that their contracts would be withdrawn or when they bid next time they get no contracts that is what is stifling this country and that is sad
925384 we have to deal with the media left unbridled they will be a permanent thorn in the side of the ppp come 2011
925385 since mr persaud is deceased the government may seek to introduce recordings as to which no participant would testify regarding who shortman refers to as is ordinarily the case
925386 we write at this time to call the courts attention to the fact that the references on the persaud tapes to shortman underscore the materiality of the information sought
925387 he didnt have a single scratch to any other part of his body
925388 hit and run fatal accident that occurred about 7 15 pm on saturday
925389 in the interest of the game and for the love of it
925390 as an administrator i am compelled to posit this advice because i prefer to live with a clean conscience
925391 may i say as a word of caution and advice that a former member of the gfas executive had externalized local football administration grievances matters which have solution strategies articulated in the gffs constitution and was sanctioned for so doing may i suggest that as a member of the gffs general council you utilize the avenues available to you to achieve the purpose you seek
925392 we will know within 24 hours the exact damage one way or the other so fingers crossed but ill be saying a few prayers tonight
925393 were still hopeful of two or three players to come on board weve got to remember that weve got two or three weeks to play with but we dont want to get backed into a corner come the end of august
925394 i thought he did very well today in terms of performance i thought he was very good
925395 i thought all of the new players looked very assured today very comfortable and they will only get stronger and better
925396 they can all deal with the ball which is the kind of player i want at the club and i have to say i am delighted with them
925397 said keane who saw his sides profligacy in front of goal punished early in the second half
925398 there was no way we were going to risk kieran
925399 but id be very surprised if he wasnt on the flight to ireland we didnt want to take any chances with him its as simple as that
925400 ive been struggling with my tempo and my rhythm lately but the longer i batted the easier it became
925401 its nice to bat with someone like andrew gale who can help me and give me the opportunity to get runs i think we batted perfect
925402 the situation regarding tommy wright is still up in the air
925403 i think it could possibly be 50 50 at the moment aberdeen have not pushed the deal ahead as theyve been away in holland so if the deal doesnt get done by the end of the week then well knock it on the head
925404 i cant go out and sign anybody until tommys wages are freed up i can only get a player in if tommy leaves if he doesnt leave then great
925405 ill speak to aberdeen on monday and get their thoughts on it
925406 hes had his contract paid up at rochdale and ive known ben since his days at man united and i had him at loan at doncaster
925407 hes an option hes a wideman and weve only got a couple so this is an ideal time to have a look and hell probably play for us again on tuesday
925408 wed like another winger if we can get one so well have to see how ben does and see what weve got left in the budget
925409 crap either all football players are injured one way or another him playing on the third string and struggling says a lot about the talent now on the chiefs roster
925410 with older more veteran players to suit up and get after it on the offensive line obviously that gamble failed miserably and now there is this quote from herm
925411 you are taking a gamble any time you go with as many young players as we are
925412 there is always a risk but what you build in this case is something that will last not a one year wonder
925413 come on herm chiefs need a new pair of shoes
925414 we have simply witnessed a bit of window dressing put forward to camouflage the continuing exploitation of the nations resources control of the bank and its assets remains firmly in foreign hands
925415 your needs have been many and varied but we have always been there in the fields with the farmers in the factories turning the wheels of production in the board rooms giving advice and counsel in the homes keeping the family together through hard times and in the schools ensuring our future through education

925435 merlin has invested massive resources in creating the dungeon concept over many years and has built an enviable reputation for the brand
925436 we also invest significant resources to continually update the london dungeon to ensure both its quality and that it delivers very high levels of customer satisfaction we will therefore fiercely protect the goodwill in the london dungeon brand particularly from such blatantly parasitic behaviour
925437 while we believe in fair competition the type of illegal activity we have seen from the london bridge experience is totally unacceptable and is not something we will tolerate our proposal for a consensual resolution having been rejected we have no alternative but to put a stop to this behaviour through formal legal channels in order to protect the london dungeon brand
925438 we are very disappointed to find ourselves at the mercy of the merlin group ever since we opened they have made repeated demands to us to restrict our activities because the london bridge experience is located close to their
925439 had we agreed to merlins original conditions which included not doing any promotions within 200 metres of the london dungeon we would not have even been able to go into our own attraction it is ludicrous we would love the public to support us in our fight

925442 ik heb zoiets nog nooit eerder gezien ik doe aangifte tegen de mensen die de verschrikkelijke dingen over mij schrijven
925443 returning is not easy 3 000 houses belonging to the displaced in different regions of the iraqi capital are still occupied by strangers and they refuse to leave despite the incentives provided by the government including the payment of 300 000 dinars dh919 or 250 per month for six months to urge these outsiders who have seized the houses of displaced people to leave
925444 the iraqi government has embarked on a strategic policy for the return of the displaced to baghdad this policy includes ensuring the voluntary return of the displaced and providing effective mechanisms for reintegration into society and providing them with proper services and freedom from sectarian religion or denomination
925445 painful memories and fears in the hearts of the displaced may prevent their return to their homes in large numbers
925446 do not install the sip cx gateway on the lcs server as this will lead to problems with lcs setting up trusted sites
925447 the sip cx gateway can be installed on the tms server the lcs server or a dedicated server the only difference is that if installing it on the lcs server the default sip cx port 5060 cannot be used for the lcs sip cx gateway communication as it will cause port conflicts with the lcs software
925448 yes we had a meeting but i cannot disclose any details
925449 we intend to move zee next to asia today ltd the plan is to get a foreign investor in zee next and kids programming that we will be stepping into
925450 atl will invest in convertible debentures within five year period to be issued by zee next the shareholding of atl for the purpose of consolidation prior to conversion of debenture would be 45 per cent and post conversion of cd within 5 year would go up to 55 60 per cent
925451 we are looking at an investor who is willing to put 80 per cent funds atl will put in 20 per cent but the shareholding will be disproportionate to the investments
925452 this is also why we are structuring the holding in such a way 45 per cent that it doesnt get reflected in the consolidated results

925480 i played the best summer hard season in my life so im very happy for that
925481 in the second set i felt well and in some moments i felt i was playing better than him finally he beat me i just congratulate him because hes playing well
925482 day after day im getting stronger in the segment of my game which is really important coming up to the final stages of the tournament
925483 rafa always gives 100 percent in every match and on any surface it was a challenge and i accepted it
925484 i just went out and gave myself some great chances
925485 you can score out here if you are playing from the fairway it gets tougher from the rough
925486 shayne bannan called me with the news and i was on the table getting treatment with my knee all bandaged up in ice and an electro stimulator attached and he said weve got that second place
925487 every day im doing the physio and treatment on my knee and every day its getting better but well decide on monday today morning whether i go or adam hansen goes in my place
925488 then beyond that for me to go and start the time trial id have to have a pretty stellar ride in the road race i dont want to go unless i can do a good result for myself and the team or contribute to a good result for the team so if i dont recover from my injury and am not close to my best i dont mind staying at home
925489 treatment on cadels knee has been going well and were hopeful that on monday hell get the all clear to fly to beijing
925490 considering the progress of his recovery were optimistic that he can back up after the road race and give the time trial a decent go

925497 commuters took 10 3 billion trips on public transportation last year the most in 50 years
925498 david amp karen bell are among less than 1 of realtors in the greater seattle area to have been awarded by seattle magazine the five star real estate agent
925499 i was just a little bit off missing fairways by four or five yards and then i missed it big on 11 and 13 i was getting misaligned in my set up and it was affecting my swing
925500 my alignment was just not quite square to the target i had been swinging great this week but if youre misaligned youve got to make a compensation
925501 it could have been a better round but youve got to take what it gives you
925502 a few short putts here and there would have made a big difference but i made a few as well so that kind of evens it out i played solid today and if i can do that tomorrow i think i have a chance
925503 i hit a couple of poor iron shots but other than that i gave myself a pretty pain free day under quite testing conditions
925504 i felt really comfortable on the greens today and it showed on the longer putts i was running it at the hole most of the day
925505 this is a significant message from the chinese to say that china is now open to the world
925506 a splendid performance at the olympics opening ceremony is of major importance
925507 specifically on the eighth the weather in beijing will be cloudy and overcast and we will see some rain showers and thunder showers
925508 good weather has a great deal to do with the natural conditions but whether this can be maintained has a lot to do with our pollution control measures because they also have a lot to do with the improvement
925509 the conditions you were working in on tuesday were not good
925510 i am not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china
925511 i am sure that come the ninth of august the day after the opening ceremony the magic of the games and the flawless organization will take over
925512 commission member chou and other members mentioned in the meeting that there was a gap between the acquittals of the two cases and the expectation of the public

925520 since 25 percent of our bodys total energy goes into moving muscle and 75 percent into regulating heat reducing an athletes core temperature before the marathon or a field hockey match means more energy for the competition itself
925521 the city government violated the law and sacrificed peoples rights
925522 a growing number of people are receiving prostitution related information from messages posted on the message board found on web logs
925523 some pimps post pictures of sexy girls in online photo albums and leave their contact information
925524 the number is 3 8 percent already from january to may this year
925525 we found on these web sites words like how to have exciting sex in the car late night live sex and images of women wearing only bras or ads for sex toys there were no restrictions
925526 aside from sex related messages we also discovered violent movie preview clips which are restricted on tv but are broadcast freely over the internet
925527 we logged onto yahoo sites simultaneously at 4pm on june 23 and found two descriptions with words hinting at sex on yahoo taiwan one on yahoo china but none on other countries yahoo sites
925528 the yahoo taiwan site also had two images of women in their underwear while none of the other yahoo sites did
925529 studies have shown that the more children and young adults view inappropriate material the more likely they are to have twisted values
925530 i call on all internet content providers to be considerate and guard our children against such inappropriate internet content
925531 lawmakers should amend the laws or create a cross ministry body to take charge of internet content
925532 i had to leave the pit box i was afraid he was going to punch me in the neck
925533 carl said what would you do if you thought we would get the track cleaned off and keep running
925534 we argue we get mad we walk away and then we come back together and cooler heads prevail we have arguments and discussions but then we have handshakes and hugs and we come to terms with what we want to do ninety percent of the time it works out for us
925535 today mr jalili will talk over the phone with mr solana
925536 when it comes to our inalienable rights we will press ahead
925537 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying
925538 they leave the security council no choice but to increase the sanctions as called for in the last resolution passed
925539 when it comes to sanctions experience shows that it is ineffective especially when it comes to the nuclear issue
925540 of course in the event of a possible war we will aim to prolong its duration so as to be able to take advantage of all our missile and non missile capabilities

925552 im a huge national park fan and often get a yearly pass that 80 will be hard to recoup this year
925553 i also want to say i soured a great deal on the pass after recent trips i found i had to pay at

925555 of all parks and monuments along with admission fees parking fees additional fees etc that would be so informative and so easy to implement
925556 for many of our mountain commuters it is the only form of transportation that these people have
925557 everything that we do is being undermined by the fuel crisis
925558 you would put a lot of people out of work if you took their bus away from them
925559 it takes time and privacy especially working out the methods which i wouldnt have guessed anyone really knew in the lab at that time
925560 people given these kinds of responsibilities with this kind of power at their fingertips we have to make sure that they are not likely to do harm to others or misuse that authority be it intentionally or be it because of some mental problem
925561 these kinds of situations cry out for reexamination of our standards
925562 youre basically going to scare off any scientist from wanting to work in this field if it becomes even more stringent
925563 it is a balance its a policy decision about how stringent we want to be
925564 but when girls were down there he would just stare at them from the bridge

925568 the wide adoption of tp3001 by so many terminal vendors within a short time span speaks volumes on the successful commercialization of the product and we thank our strategic partners smic and infineon for their support throughout the process
925569 as the leading chipset provider telepath is proud to contribute to the launching of the domestically developed cmmb mobile tv network for the 2008 beijing olympic games in anticipation of the significant ramp up of the cmmb industry telepath will be introducing a series of new products with more advanced features together with smic we are committed to providing the best chipset solutions for all cmmb mobile device vendors

925572 smic congratulates telepath for its achievement and for the success of cmmb a home grown chinese satellite tv innovation created under the leadership of many government and industry organizations
925573 the mass production of the cmmb demodulator chip and the successful commercial launch of mobile tvs and handsets during a highly visible event such as the olympics showcases the significant role that chinese innovations can play in creating technology solutions for china and provides the international community an opportunity to consider adoption chinese solutions such as the tp3001 are the product of leadership and cooperation and smic is proud to have been involved in and supporting this project since day one by enabling its success smic demonstrates its continued support for chinese innovation and the development of china controlled intellectual property and standards
925574 meltdown the inside story of the north korean nuclear crisis
925575 its interesting that the transcript remains classified but it appears that a north korean offical used much more ambiguous language and also tabled an offer to negotiate which kelly rejected
925576 there are parallels and differences obviously with the way the intelligence became a source of controversy in iraq but unlike iraq the actual intelligence that the americans had in north korea in the spring and summer of 2002 was pretty solid
925577 but the combination of internal politics and media generalization created an impression that it was somewhat different from the reality
925578 they wanted to use this as a flaming red star cluster into the sky that the north koreans cheated abrogated the agreed framework we always told you this was a bad idea
925579 there is an irony here that the hardliners attempt to pressure the north koreans to give up the bomb in fact created circumstances where the north became a nuclear power and made the whole process of undoing their nuclear program much much harder than had they adopted a similar approach at the beginning
925580 the fact that remuneration must correspond to the true value of performance constitutes an essential element of the social market economy
925581 we oppose the visit by bush who sells u s beef with its risk of mad cow disease that threatens the health and lives of the public
925582 just as lee paid a big price to stay at camp david in april bush will be looking to go home with a big catch
925583 we have no concerns in terms of this development in current market conditions
925584 it is sad news local companies are having to cut back
925585 we want to give the message to people locally we are very much committed to the project in nairn
925586 i want to make sure that the council and the people of glasgow pay due respect to military personnel and their families
925587 these men and women who risk their lives for our country deserve greater recognition for their work and sadly in some cases for their sacrifices
925588 changing our policy on council tax benefit is a relatively small gesture by the council that could have a big impact financially on hundreds of war pensioners and their families
925589 we are working against the clock not just politically but out there in the real world because every year that passes we get more invasions and those invasions stay forever
925590 by the time the ship finally makes it into shore most of what you got rid of will have regrown
925591 you dont know what new or additional invasive species youll pick up
925592 there is no doubt that ballast water legislation that stems the tide of invasive species entering our waters from ships needs to be passed immediately
925593 disappointed that we have not yet been able to move this bill out of the senate
925594 i think we can make this work and all i care about is the end result
925595 and im here for one got to protect the health of the people i represent
925596 negligible value claims section 24 of taxation of chargeable gains act 1992 treat the shares as being disposed of and immediately reacquired at their nil or negligible value at the date the claim is made or not more than two years before the start of the tax year in which the claim is made
925597 any claims submitted in this current tax year therefore can be backdated to 6th april 2006
925598 the claim creates a capital loss that can be set against gains arising in the same year or carried forward until another taxable gain arises

925612 when we need a hit its just not coming right now we have to get that better and thats the bottom line
925613 we had our chances and we didnt do anything with them
925614 this win shows us no lead and no pitching staff should be able to stop us night in and night out like they have been doing
925615 that jose arredondo is dirty too scot shields those are tough pitchers
925616 nady can hit anywhere in the middle of the order
925617 he has power hes good in rbi situations and has been clutch all year in pittsburgh and here
925618 i was one of the happiest ones here when we got the trade because i have seen him over the years being a pain in the butt
925619 this year is another chance for me to get that spot and its another setback im just trying to be positive about it
925620 gerris you never know we dont know whats going to happen with him when is he going to be out there
925621 he was drafted by the franchise youre hoping guys like that have success
925622 i dont know if youd say it that strongly that we want him to have the job we want the best player to have the job but youre partial to the guys you draft youre hoping gerris is what we expected coming out of college i can remember him distinctly i thought hed be a good nfl player and i think he will be
925623 if i want it i got to go get it
925624 i didnt know much about gerris prior to getting here hes an exceptional athlete im excited about competing against him
925625 in the 100 i got her and in the 200 i dont know the 400 shell kill me
925626 would you be comfortable sharing a beer with bush or gore
925627 on behalf of brett on behalf of the packers on behalf of fans
925628 we stole one and they tried to steal it back and fortunately for us we ended up winning
925629 when i say oops i dont question anything i did it was just like uhhh i cant believe it especially after we get two quick outs fortunately our guys fought back and its a huge win for us
925630 i dont think its anything i have to be concerned with or worried about
925631 when he got hit in the knee in st louis on july 1 he wasnt able to do a lot of conditioning and i think that set him back some now that hes back doing that work hes getting back to the point where he can get a little more velocity
925632 the strength is there but when i had to go back out saturday night i couldnt locate a ball inside
925633 i wasnt doing us any good when they dont have finish on them its like throwing batting practice
925634 i dont want to hamper the team and try to fight an uphill battle when were in a close division race
925635 im more than capable of pitching at any time next week
925636 this is not a setback getting a bullpen arm was the more important thing ill pitch every fifth day after i come back
925637 im enjoying it im happy to be here happy to have another shot its cool getting the rust off and getting ready to get back into form
925638 ive never really looked at football as a glorification sport
925639 to some people thats what they enjoy to me ive never really been a spotlight person i take pride in going out there strapping on the pads and giving 100 percent
925640 im a grunt im old school im my fathers son he was an offensive lineman and im a defensive lineman my brothers a defensive lineman we take pride in doing the dirty work and we dont need the glorification
925641 on the first day of hitting he popped some punch
925642 he is an amazing physical player he has size and speed and i dont know what his official weight is but i know its a lot more than i am
925643 this is a great opportunity for both of us to get better its something thats exciting for my development and for the team
925644 i think i caught nick a little off guard but he stepped up to the plate quick it was cool to let him know that even though i am a vet whos starting to get old in age ive still got it
925645 its hard to practice without pads on because football is a violent sport
925646 final season contributions of pettitte and mussina and whether wang get back on 19 win or something like it beam will all be big factors in how ths plays out
925647 i had a long and difficult childhood as one of the last lifers in the american orphanage system but ultimately i found hope
925648 it was that hope helped me rise above my childhood to become whole emotionally psychologically socially and spiritually
925649 most of our images of orphanage life are all fictional characters oliver twist anne of green gables little orphan annie
925650 and yet in all of those cases the children are rescued by someone who is rich the reality for most like in my case is that were not rescued in castaway kid i wanted to take the reader into the confusion the frustration the anger the loneliness of the abandoned child
925651 its fun to be rejuvenated and be part of this
925652 it just makes it fun to be in the park
925653 after last year i didnt know where i was going to be come aug 1 this year
925654 i think that the play that he scored on is a really good look on how a tight end can affect the defense
925655 deep down the middle of the field he gets over the top catches it you miss one tackle and you go the distance
925656 this is just a precaution its to give me some more time and to help the bullpen
925657 while miles has held his cards closely on this matter it seems clear the no 1 quarterback on the depth chart entering camp is andrew hatch thats largely because the 6 foot 3 214 pound sophomore is the only quarterback on the tigers roster who has taken a college snap completing one of two attempts last year for a 4 yard gain

925676 i would appeal to anyone who was in the area at the time and may have seen something to contact police as soon as possible
925677 their information could be crucial and will be treated in the strictest confidence
925678 i believe we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males
925679 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing

925797 cdcs first estimates from this system reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known results indicate that approximately 56 300 new hiv infections occurred in the united states in 2006

925799 though the number of new hiv infections remains unacceptably high

925833 higher oil prices and the lack of adequate fiscal policy reactions amidst high pent up price pressures are putting the burden of macro economic adjustment on the monetary authorities
925834 as a result policy as well as market interest rates could rise and a sharp deceleration in growth may follow
925835 if the fiscal policy response remains inadequate amidst heightened external shocks or resulted in an intensification of domestic inflation then ratings pressure for a change in indias sovereign ratings outlook from stable to negative would increase
925836 while moodys overall assessment is that the current constellation of risks is captured in the prevailing stable outlook downside pressures could emerge
925837 firstly they could involve deterioration in the governments general debt metrics and its access to external liquidity given intensified commodity price shocks and an inadequate fiscal response
925838 secondly such pressures could be due to the rising risk of fiscal spillovers to indias external accounts
925839 such spillover if large enough could weaken the case for the two notch gap between its foreign currency and local currency ratings
925840 the governments fiscal difficulties relate partly to its inability to raise retail fuel prices and reduce the growing off budget fiscal cost of reimbursing downstream oil companies as part of its subsidies program
925841 greater government borrowing needs while not leading to a material deterioration of its key credit metrics would likely prevent an improvement in the remainder of fy 2008 09 contrary to our earlier expectations

925854 les r formes structurelles qui commencent par g n rer des co ts avant de produire des avantages peuvent se heurter une opposition politique moindre si le poids du changement politique est support dans un premier temps par les ch meurs en effet ces derniers sont moins susceptibles que les employeurs ou les salari s en place de constituer une majorit politique capable de bloquer la r forme dans la mesure o ils sont moins nombreux et souvent moins organis s
925855 structural reforms from which costs arise first whereas benefits come later may encounter less political opposition if the burden of the policy change is borne initially by the unemployed the latter are less likely than employers or incumbent employees to form a political majority capable of blocking the reform since they are less numerous and often less organised

925953 racial profiling may explain why incarceration rates are so high among young african americans law enforcement officials may be targeting blacks and other minorities as potential criminals and are using the vehicle code as a tool to stop and search them

926012 comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices and whats even worse than the shift itself yes sometimes compromise is necessary is the ridiculous claim that it will bring gas prices down its never necessary to say something you know isnt true
926013 repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
926014 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
926015 i think its important for the american people to understand were not going to drill our way out of this problem
926016 its also important to recognize if you start drilling now you wont see a drop of oil for ten years which means its not going to have a significant impact on short term prices every expert agrees on that
926017 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
926018 the presidency would like to place it on record that president mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from man ferrostaal
926019 the sunday times or anyone who has evidence that the president or anyone else received bribe s in the procurement process should as we have emphasised before approach the law enforcement agencies
926020 no evidence was found of any improper or unlawful conduct by the government
926021 selling off our nations coastlines to the oil and gas companies wont make a dent in gas prices if you started drilling tomorrow you wouldnt even see a drop of oil until 2017 this is a fraud policy and a false choice
926022 my interest is in making sure that weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done

926026 barack obama has played the race card he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
926027 i dont look like the president on a dollar bill or a five dollar bill
926028 theyve decided they cant win on the issues so now theyre going to try to destroy his character
926029 i want to have a campaign not of insults but of ideas
926030 obamas like the guy at the country club with the beautiful date and a martini and a cigarette in his hand
926031 i dont think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president
926032 selling off our nations coastlines to the oil and gas companies wont make a dent in gas prices if you started drilling tomorrow you wouldnt even see a drop of oil until 2017 this is a fraud policy and a false choice

926037 i try and plan always opportunities for our deaf and hard of hearing kids that they wouldnt have otherwise
926038 one of the songs is already in five languages and so now its in five languages and being signed
926039 these kids can do everything that any other kid can do and they prove that over and over again
926040 that made me feel really really good and i would love to meet her someday
926041 antonia gave me a whole different viewpoint about the deaf
926042 she taught me that anybody can do anything if they put their mind to it i still cant believe she nailed every step
926043 if theres any other deaf person out in the crowd i am hoping to be a good example for them to come out to try and get involved dont just sit there because youre deaf
926044 i dont want the hearing to say that poor thing she cant do anything i rebel i get crazy i get nuts we the deaf dont want pity we dont want mercy we are in control of our lives
926045 i want to teach the deaf in academics sports or dance so they understand wont be scared and give up
926046 i just felt like she was a very special woman
926047 it didnt matter to me if she was deaf or not shes one of a kind
926048 we were never given the option to attend as a public patient and this was an issue in direct contradiction with the information provided on the health ministry website
926049 if anything breaks which happens quite a lot with an eight year old child we would have to foot the bill some of the parts like the system itself including the internal part is anywhere up to 20 000
926050 the reason for the eligibility criteria is the demand for cochlear implant services exceeds the available resources

926055 my family friends and my boyfriend kept saying that it was once in a life time opportunity which i should grab
926056 after a while i agreed with them and took the opportunity
926057 if it wasnt for them i wouldnt have won miss deaf world
926058 i communicate with them the timing of the music so they can keep pace
926059 for some music i give them the eight counts for them to dance to
926060 the fact that we won trophies at our first hearing competition was awesome for us
926061 i have to pinch myself to believe that they won all the awards

926224 les propuse realizar una jornada el lunes que consiste en una movilizaci n con el fin de no confrontar sino por el contrario de reunir a distintas congregaciones religiosas cat lica jud a ortodoxas evang licas para que los pastores hagan una especie de llamado a la reconciliaci n a las partes que est n en conflicto
926225 reci n estamos a medio a o y ya se han perdido 20 d as de clases con el agravante de que los docentes mantienen un paro por tiempo indefinido que perjudica a los ni os de manera irreparable
926226 a las distintas entidades religiosas a participar de la concentraci n
926227 el fin continu el funcionario es orar por eso no hablamos de confrontar sino de que en esta concentraci n tratemos de reflexionar y pedimos a los participantes que lleven velas
926228 un acto que no va llevar m s de 15 20 minutos
926229 ya tenemos algunas congregaciones religiosas que se han comprometido a participar y hacer una oraci n en conjunto para que este conflicto finalice lo antes posible
926230 se llegue a un fin realmente bueno y feliz y que los ni os la semana que viene tengan clases
926231 no queremos que haya ni vencedores ni vencidos sino que esto se arregle por el bien de la comunidad y por el bien de nuestros ni os que son el futuro de esta provincia
926232 queremos que la tierra del fuego vea que hay otro peronismo
926233 fue una auto convocatoria de los compa eros en funci n de dialogar sobre todos los temas de la realidad de la provincia y tambi n todo lo que tiene que ver con el mbito nacional e institucional
926234 todos hemos sido coincidentes en esa reuni n con el desacuerdo que tenemos con la actual conducci n del partido y tratando de generar acciones en funci n de que la sociedad de la provincia de tierra del fuego y los afiliados peronistas vean tambi n que hay otra dirigencia
926235 muchos de los que estaban all tienen afinidad con el proyecto del compa ero n stor kirchner y la presidente cristina fern ndez de kirchner
926236 queremos que la tierra del fuego vea que hay otro peronismo
926237 quiere otro tipo de conducci n y est luchando por un recambio en la conducci n del partido
926238 siempre hemos coincidido por una cuesti n generacional y tambi n por una situaci n de estar luchando codo a codo respaldando un proyecto nacional y llevando las banderas de este proyecto en todo sentido tanto en lo interno del partido como en lo institucional hace muchos a os que nosotros venimos ligados con una idea com n al presidente del partido justicialista n stor kirchner y a la presidente del pa s cristina kirchner comulgamos la misma visi n de ellos desde el punto de vista de proyecci n del pa s como de la proyecci n de lo que es el movimiento peronista
926239 por los tiempos porque se vienen las elecciones a diputados nacionales en octubre del 2009 y el peronismo necesita rearmarse lo antes posible con una nueva dirigencia que genere confianza en lo que es internamente en el movimiento y tambi n en la sociedad de tierra del fuego y que el peronismo comience a marcar posiciones sobre diferentes temas que hacen a la realidad de tierra del fuego y pueda ocupar diferentes roles en los ejecutivos y en los cuerpos colegiados
926240 es un peronismo amplio moderno y abierto a todos los que se quieran sumar y sobre todo que la gente vea que hay otros dirigentes peronistas que quieren otra forma de peronismo en tierra del fuego en funci n de buscar el crecimiento de la provincia y el crecimiento del movimiento peronista para mejorar la calidad de vida de todos los fueguinos
926241 la amenaza m s grande para la seguridad se halla en las regiones tribales de pakist n donde los terroristas entrenan a los insurgentes que van a combatir a afganist n no podemos tolerar un santuario terrorista y como presidente no quiero tolerarlo necesitamos una alianza m s fuerte y sostenida entre afganist n pakist n y la otan para asegurar la frontera eliminar los campos terroristas y adoptar medidas en rgicas contra los insurgentes que cruzan la frontera necesitamos m s tropas m s helic pteros m s sat lites m s aviones teledirigidos predator en la regi n de la frontera afgana y debemos dejar claro que si pakist n no puede o no quiere actuar acabaremos con cuantos terroristas de alto nivel como bin laden se nos pongan por delante
926242 fuimos a ushuaia en la fecha que ten a que presentarme fui a tesorer a y all no exist a ning n dato sobre esto
926243 iba con la expectativa de cobrar porque la gobernadora se comprometi hace dos semanas atr s de que se iba a arreglar la situaci n a m me toc una parte por la parte de la obra que hice y que este viernes 1 de agosto deb a recibir yo la orden de pago para que se deposite el dinero
926244 son cuotas que yo no las pude levantar porque no estoy cobrando lo que me est debiendo gobierno de ltima voy a terminar debi ndole yo al gobierno no solo el cr dito sino tambi n la deuda que tienen conmigo
926245 hace un a o largo que albanesi no cobra esta gesti n ya lleva siete meses para tratar de ver un expediente en este caso el del propio albanesi
926246 los meses pasan y no hay soluci n la propia gobernadora mantuvo un encuentro con los proveedores y la nota autorizando el cobro en tesorer a es la palabra oficial de fabiana r os que se comprometi a dar una respuesta concreta y efectiva
926247 es el agente financiero del estado provincial entonces nos encontramos con que por un lado el estado no paga desde hace un a o y medio y por el otro lado el mismo estado ejecuta ante dos cuotas ca das
926248 ac nos encontramos con proveedores y estamos hablando del esfuerzo privado y fuentes alternativas de producci n cuyos cr ditos son el acceso a fuentes de desarrollo ac nos encontramos primero con cr ditos impagos porque el gobierno como en el caso de albanesi est propiciando que unos setenta productores y empresarios pymes queden en la calle afectando a unas 270 familias por una determinaci n pol tica
926249 hay personas que ten an el cr dito crece para ser otorgado y tampoco se los otorga
926250 estas obras tranquilamente se las pod a haber hecho con empresas grandes pero hubo una decisi n pol tica de la anterior gesti n de que las pymes participen porque de ese modo se generaba mayor mano de obra ocupada
926251 no se pudo probar absolutamente nada en los presuntos perjuicios fiscales adem s en democracia no se puede hablar de presunto ya que somos todos inocentes hasta que se nos demuestre lo contrario hablar de presunciones de culpabilidad y de culpar como se est haciendo en este caso no solo culpar sino condenar porque estamos condenando a albanesi a que tenga que subsistir en una condici n de miseria esto es grav simo porque es violar los m s elementales derechos amparados por la constituci n
926252 hace siete meses que este gobierno est buscando acusar por presunciones y no ha logrado encontrar ni probar absolutamente nada y es m s los expedientes se pierden las rdenes de pago desaparecen
926253 estos proveedores cumplieron con el estado y no es verdad lo que dice la se ora fabiana r os respecto a que por el tribunal de cuentas est n siendo observadas esta gesti n envi todo al tribunal de cuentas esta gesti n est enviando todo a la justicia para no pagar esta gesti n est llevando a 270 familias a la miseria solo con la presunci n nosotros no queremos m s presunciones

926264 theyre making every single play in the field and were making none like today first inning the ball is hit at me and i should at least knock it down and i cant even do that
926265 as long as they ask permission which they did its fine with me

926304 everyone in yorkshire said the castle we shot in was haunted that a single old man stayed there and his wife died and her spirit still lives on there

926306 we have formed a three member committee of experts that will see the movie and based on their feedback further action will be taken
926307 the films promos showed a sikh character wearing a turban while sporting a french cut this is not a positive sikh image the screening should not be allowed until its makers make changes in the portrayal of sikh character

926316 we had to manage this horses program because of a couple of little niggling problems that young horses are prone to but we also opted to geld him recently and i reckon thats whats made the world of difference to how he performs at the races
926317 our vet art meeker was the one who suggested we spell him for six months ands we took that advice and then he suggested we geld him and the horse has since turned the corner
926318 we always believed he possessed above average ability but the task has been figuring out how to get the best out of him and i think were winning that battle
926319 ulittledevil has really turned it around of late and i expect him to keep improving
926320 i kept telling the owners of ulittledevil to be patient and thankfully the horse lived up to my expectations

926394 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
926395 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

926398 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
926399 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

926457 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
926458 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
926459 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs

926473 i dont think theres anyone there who would have the foggiest idea how to do it you would need to have the opportunity the capability and the motivation and he didnt possess any of those
926474 as well as we knew each other and the way the labs were run someone would discover what was going on

926477 thats not the bruce we knew he was sweet friendly i mean he was into grass recycling
926478 as far back as the year 2000 ivins has actually attempted to murder several other people including through poisoning
926479 he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted especially towards women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
926480 because he was about to be indicted on capital murder charges he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him

926486 there is perhaps a danger that the proposed changes are large enough to be noticed but not large enough to change behaviour
926487 if climate change really is as important and urgent as the government frequently and rightly acknowledges then it would suggest there is a strong and defensible case for much more penal taxes on high emissions cars

926490 how to deploy and use these kinds of substances so you start to piece it all together
926491 hoe ben je er toe gekomen om met een weblog te starten

926494 if you give hives a thump you get a little roar coming back and i didnt get any roars
926495 some had bees but the mysterious ones had virtually nothing everything had disappeared
926496 we have all the components here of the american style disorder in terms of disease
926497 probably these sorts of losses havent been seen since the early 1900s there is clearly something taking place over and above the normal vicissitudes of beekeeping
926498 because bees pollinate a third of everything that we eat most fruits and nuts vegetables and seeds the plants we use for cattle feed wed end up with a food shortage and very high prices
926499 in the sum of the whole of the agriculture business its a drop in the ocean
926500 theres insufficient allocation for research and bees are so fundamental to our environment
926501 what is most important is that we have a clear understanding of disease threats and how to tackle them
926502 that is why we are developing a bee health strategy which will set out the objectives and priorities for the bee health program over the next 10 years
926503 the bee health strategy is proving to be a delaying tactic
926504 its a fig leaf for not spending the money thats really needed
926505 this years probably the biggest business year that weve ever had
926506 thats in terms of demand for bees and the amount of people who want to re queen their colonies
926507 the bees are not behaving as they normally do something has upset them

926538 the adipositivity project aims to promote size acceptance not by listing the merits of big people or detailing examples of excellence these things are easily seen all around us but rather through a visual display of fat physicality the sort thats normally unseen the hope is to widen definitions of physical beauty literally the photographs here are close details of the fat female form without the inclusion of faces one reason for this is to coax observers into imagining theyre looking at the fat women in their own lives ideally then accepting them as having aesthetic appeal which for better or worse often translates into more complete forms of acceptance

926562 i think the country may well vote mmp out but i think they will vote in another proportional system
926563 i dont think theyll go back to first past the post
926564 its two quite specific areas and when you see them the way that we are funding the tax cut programme it is very clear and its not ambiguous
926565 everyone knows where the labour led government stands on the issues that matters there are no hidden agendas
926566 you will be in a position where nationals tax cut programme effectively when combined with our changes will be the same cost as labours
926567 any argument that national is borrowing for tax cuts well if that was the case then labours borrowing for tax cuts

926578 were not a proxy for broadcast media so there can be a shift as weve seen in the quarter between very measurable marketing services which are the largest part of our company vs what is spent in broadcast or some of the other media areas so we have seen shifts we havent seen reductions to our revenue base
926579 for the first time in its history theyre going to have a magazine that is going to make money when a newspaper is bleeding and you have something that will lift the newspaper immediately why not
926580 actually the magazine turned profits in the early 1990s and in 2004 but the underlying problem was always the advertising department in the early 1990s ad sales staff had financial incentives to sell the magazine they worked then ad department rivalries reasserted themselves and the incentives were killed readership surveys consistently found the magazine was the third best read section on sundays behind a section and calendar the problem wasnt readership the l a times magazine failed for lack of a separate sales staff

926589 all our work tells us they are pretty keen to keeping sic the bit theyve got and we call them labour plus voters and theyre sitting here thinking that man mr key is pretty smart hell get me a bit more
926590 so were sitting here saying the punters are keen to keep it
926591 the last thing we want is to spend the whole election campaign with families of four on tv saying mr keys taking money off us you cant do that

926685 virtualising this gives you a couple of new ways to tackle those traditional problems
926686 on the desktop we are seeing people place great value in being able to abstract the desktop from actual physical hardware

926696 hes still a premier offensive player i would guess hed play hard but hes still a run producer
926697 griffey can be pitched to and its going to be fun to watch him play centerfield i dont think he can but were going to find out
926698 is the combination of diminished ability and the fact that he doesnt play both are issues
926699 now if he goes out and busts his butt its different it may happen for a week or two weeks or three weeks but at one point in time hes going to get comfortable and go back into being a one gait player

926717 within the microsoft environment we have struggled for years with applications that are written so poorly that they will not work with others
926718 virtualising this gives you a couple of new ways to tackle those traditional problems
926719 on the desktop we are seeing people place great value in being able to abstract the desktop from actual physical hardware
926720 people take their application the operating system they want to run it against package it up along with policy and security they want and use that as a virtual client
926721 the value of microsoft windows of what that product is today will diminish as more applications move to the web and microsoft needs to edge out in front of that
926722 i would be surprised if there was definitive evidence that nothing like this was not kicking around
926723 eighty percent of windows sales are made when a new pc is sold
926724 thats a huge amount of money for them that they do not have to go out and get
926725 we are sad to bring you the news that our upcoming shows are going to be our last as a band
926726 we thank you for all your love and support these past few years its been a blast but the time has come for the four of us to go our separate ways
926727 i think theyve had more struggles within the band than we notice their original drummer left between the two albums and that has to be hard no matter what the circumstances second album get awkward was fucked up because of the label maybe theyre just done they started the band as teenagers its a lot to go through at that age a crazy rocknroll life maybe theyre just growing up
926728 benefiting from early detection through a doctor ordered mri the cancer is not life threatening christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery
926729 gradually be layered on top of existing methods of assessing quality and generating scholarly reputations and they will over time merge with and influence them someday hiring committees may pay less attention to journal placements and more attention to page views
926730 the result may be a downward spiral in quality importance and attractiveness of the law reviews both to authors and to editors
926731 disconnected from the flow of real time political and legal events
926732 few tend to think it is a good thing that second year students are the gate keepers to our most important research vehicles and i doubt very many think it makes no difference to what gets published in the top journals
926733 unfortunately some find the practice of law is not for them
926734 however it is our experience that a legal education is a tremendous asset for a variety of professional paths
926735 this blog would become the online authority about the case and its ramifications
926736 if done well an hvm blog would provide immediate benefits to the entire legal profession prosecutors and defense attorneys across the country would rely on it as a resource and judges might even cite the blog in a court opinion
926737 its proving to be useful enough were really going to take advantage of it and use it as a business tool

926744 if law schools are fabricating data for the rankings they are also submitting fabricated data that their own accrediting body requires them to submit each year
926745 having to lose eight people in a community is very traumatic and this was one of the worst shack fires i have ever witnessed
926746 seeing those charred bodies lying there was an awful experience
926747 four boys and a pregnant girl were discovered in one shack by firefighters after extinguishing the raging fire the security gate was locked and the children were unable to escape
926748 the municipality will assist with material so that those who lost their homes can rebuild their shacks as we are still busy with a housing development plan in cato crest
926749 we will be talking to the bereaved families and will assist with the funeral arrangements
926750 the situation is getting out of hand shacks cannot just keep burning like this i would like to issue a strong warning throughout the province that shack dwellers need to be careful when using candles and paraffin stoves
926751 alcohol also plays a significant role when shacks are burnt because most of the fires take place during weekends when people are drunk
926752 pemanggilan ms kaban memang hak prerogatif presiden karena tidak ada orang yang kebal hukum tapi saya minta agar pemanggilan ms kaban bukan permainan atau trik politik untuk menghabisi pbb
926753 jika alasan kuat itu ada ms kaban harus nonaktif maka kewajiban presiden untuk tetap mengangkat penggantinya dari pbb entah di pos yang mana tetap di menhut atau pos lain
926754 masa jabatan kabinet yang tinggal sekian bulan mungkin tidak banyak berarti tetapi secara simbolis dari sisi partai ini sangat penting cukup sudah presiden buang yusril dan diganti kader partai lain sebagai tindakan yang melanggar fatsoen politik

926863 what happens in practice is that if you look at all the dogmas in all cultures all societies have what i call a hassle free zone it is that area within any culture within each dogma religious economic political etc wherein if you conform to it you are in the comfort zone no ones going to laugh at you condemn you for being different or for expressing your uniqueness because you are locked into the herd mentality and you are conforming to what you are told you should be and do when you step out of this mind set and express your unique aspect of all that exists and refuse to be frightened or controlled you immediately face ridicule or condemnation as i have in england
926864 whatever happened to living the vast majority of people rich and poor on this planet are enslaved enslaved by the systems robotic programming its economic imprisonment and by their own refusal to think question and find the liberation that comes with an open mind we dont live in a free society we live as robots in a society in which you are free to do what the society wants you to do produce and consume thats the reality

926957 we speak mainly english not spanish lebanese arabic chinese japanese russian or any other language therefore if you wish to become part of our society learn the language
926958 most australians believe in god this is not some christian right wing political push but a fact because christian men and women on christian principles founded this nation and this is clearly documented it is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools if god offends you then i suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home because god is part of our culture

926971 es una idea muy antigua pero nadie hab a realizado los c lculos num ricos para ver lo que suceder a cuando un gran asteroide impact en marte
926972 las dos explicaciones principales que se han propuesto para la dicotom a hemisf ricas son alg n tipo de proceso interno que cambi una de las mitades del planeta o un gran impacto en uno de ellos

926991 ring fencing of taxes is seldom done but if government is going to induce behaviour change then producers and consumers must have the assurance that their taxes are being spent on projects that will reduce the countrys carbon footprint
926992 breaking the eskom monopoly and introducing feed in tariffs for renewable energy could unleash a wave of investment into clean energy
926993 it would also allow consumers of electricity greater choice in whom to buy electricity from giving them more options to reduce their individual carbon footprints

927027 islam is to worship allah and not worship anything besides him to offer prayers perfectly to pay the compulsory charity i e zakat and to fast the month of ramadan
927028 ihsan is to worship allah as if you see him and if you do not achieve this state of devotion then take it for granted that allah sees you
927029 that was jibreel gabriel who came to teach the people their religion
927030 there is no harm in rinsing the mouth and cooling ones body with cold water when fasting
927031 allahs apostle used to kiss some of his wives while he was fasting
927032 while i was lying with allahs messenger underneath a woolen sheet i got the menstruation and then slipped away and put on the clothes which i used to wear in menses
927033 the person who gets discharge after casting a look on his wife should complete his fast
927034 we were with the prophet s when a youth came and said may i kiss my wife while i am fasting
927035 the cupper al hajim and the cupped al mahjoum have broken the fast
927036 the prophet was cupped while he was in the state of ihram and also while he was observing a fast

927042 theres a real problem of deforestation thats of great interest to the world and some countries have decided to step up to the plate and help us solve it
927043 global deforestation of about 13 million hectares per year results in approximately 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions
927044 if theres so many obstacles you have to deal with maybe its just not meant to be and you should just go do something else
927045 the messenger of allah salla allahu alaihi wa sallam sent a man on the morning of the day of ashurah to the residences of the ansar saying whoever has spent the morning fasting is to complete his fast whoever has not spent this morning fasting should voluntary fast for the remainder of the day we fasted after that announcement as did our young children we would go to the mosque and make toys stuffed with cotton for them to play with if one of them started crying due to hunger we would give them a toy to play with until it was time to eat

927050 an elderly man is permitted to break his fast but he must feed a poor person daily
927051 and for those who can fast but do not there is a ransom
927052 it is the old man who is unable to fast so he refrains from fasting and instead feeds a poor person with a saa of wheat
927053 whoever reaches old age and is unable to fast the month of ramadan he should give a mudd of wheat for each day
927054 and for those who can fast but do not there is a ransom
927055 it has not been abrogated its ruling applies to elderly men and women who are not able to fast instead they must feed one poor person on a daily basis
927056 come i shall inform you about the fast allah the blessed and most high remitted half the prayer for the traveler and fasting for the pregnant and breast feeding
927057 this is a concession for the elderly as they can fast they are to break the fast and feed a poor person a day pregnant or breast feeding women if they fear for the child can do likewise
927058 ibn abbas used to say to his wives who were pregnant you are in the same situation as those who can fast but do not
927059 and for him who is sick among you or on a journey the same number of other days
927060 verily allah made the fast obligatory upon the prophet by revealing o you who believe fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you
927061 and do not kill yourselves allah is ever merciful to you
927062 he has not laid upon you in your religion any hardship
927063 allah loves to give allowances just as he hates that you commit sins
927064 you may fast if you wish and you may not fast if you wish
927065 and they used to hold that one who had the strength and fasted then that was good and he who was weak and refrained from fasting then that was good
927066 we fought under the leadership of the messenger of allah during ramadan some of us fasted and some of us did not the ones who fasted did not find any fault with those who did not fast and those who did not fast did not find any fault with those who did not find any fault with those who fasted they knew that if one had the strength to fast he could do so and it was good and that if one was weak he was allowed to break his fast and that was good
927067 allahs messenger s traveled in the month of ramadan and he fasted till he reached a place called usfan then he asked for a tumbler of water and drank it by the daytime so that the people might see him he broke his fast till he reached mecca
927068 allahs messenger fasted and sometimes did not fast while traveling so one may fast or may not on journeys
927069 al kadid is a land covered with water between usfan and qudaid
927070 allahs apostle set out from medina to mecca and he fasted till he reached usfan where he asked for water and raised his hand to let the people see him and then broke the fast and did not fast after that till he reached mecca and that happened in ramadan
927071 allahs apostle sometimes fasted and sometimes did not fast during the journeys so whoever wished to fast could fast and whoever wished not to fast could do so
927072 it is not righteousness that you fast on a journey
927073 allahs apostle set out from medina to mecca and he fasted till he reached usfan where he asked for water and raised his hand to let the people see him and then broke the fast and did not fast after that till he reached mecca and that happened in ramadan

927142 from the data we have 80 to 90 percent of their diet is trash fish

927146 integration with the eu is state policy and a strategic decision but it cannot run at an idle speed the process should be hastened
927147 we should take on the eu target with determination the reform process cannot be in tatters there is a need to focus turkey on the eu target and put it in a comprehensive reform process a reform campaign should be launched
927148 everybody mentions the same things like democracy the rule of law and freedoms but when it comes to meeting the eu criteria and their implementation some of them wriggle out thats why a whole reform campaign is a must

927175 as far as we understood even with the smallest golden coin three sheep could have been bought during the excavations a sikke was found near a skeleton of a soldier in those times people were keeping their sikkes in their mouths as there were no pockets whatsoever
927176 these roads are as old as the silk road there is a roman street right under the road covering a lydian road our studies will carry on all these routes

927178 we have more projects in the city but the most important one is to highlight the times when money was first used i believe this project will increase the number of tourists
927179 i heard that the course bo azi i belonged to soleymanists a religious order i did not enter there lest people think i am inspecting it
927180 we have given 18 martyrs on the face of one of our dead bodies was written lailaheillallah there is no god but allah in arabic this is a miracle we will not complain this was the will of allah
927181 will it make a difference if i cry this is fate
927182 we allocated 1 billion for project costs and the monuments board will elect the winner
927183 i do not think the difference between costs of four projects will be more than 100 million
927184 we are establishing a concept with the zorlu center all projects that were submitted to us include social and cultural structures such as conference halls concert halls museum and an electronic library as well as including hotel business center shopping mall and residences
927185 we have not yet set a turnover amount for the zorlu center
927186 we do not know what we will sell and what we will not in this project yet that is why we have not calculated the turnover we will begin to calculate after the winner is chosen
927187 we will make our promise that we would establish a project which befits istanbul this project will be an attractive one
927188 we are waiting for the legal obstacle which was a result of the case that the chamber of architectures filed to be removed said zorlu
927189 as soon as the court announces the decision we will start working on the project we plan to launch the sales by the beginning of next year and complete it by 2010 the project which is expected to be linked with the operations of the 2010 cultural capital of europe for istanbul looms large with the social and cultural areas
927190 our patriotism has cost a lot stockbreeding has come to a halt and incentives have never reached erzurum
927191 we are struggling not to witness the rotting of the computer based facilities located on 12 000 square meters deemed one of the leading facilities in europe
927192 the construction of the plant based on european norms took four years the late president turgut zal opened the facilities which provided jobs for 350 people
927193 in those years we met demand from the iranian army and a substantial proportion of middle eastern countries we offered the domestic and foreign sale of healthy animals bred at an altitude of 2 to 3 000 meters and slaughtered in hygienic conditions there were around 500 tractor trailers in row in front of the gates of the facility
927194 competition between the private sector and the public meat and fish establishment ebk plants was positive for breeders stockbreeding was the only means of living for peasants in erzurum which ranks among the top cities in terms of number of cattle
927195 at present we can slaughter only 100 cattle a month our 16 refrigerator tractor trailers do not operate my heart is bleeding
927196 my patriotism has cost me a lot i would be a king if i had invested this money in the west or abroad before inviting investors to the east they should develop facilities that are left on their own just like ours
927197 we are looking for what we like to term that wow factor
927198 we want somebody to take a drink stop look at the glass and say what was that
927199 a brewery in every town is not so crazy to think about in the future
927200 it all goes back to the movement of consuming products that are locally produced
927201 who would have ever thought that denver colorado would become the napa valley of beer
927202 this hasnt happened because of some half billion dollar advertising campaign on behalf of the big brewers
927203 its a kind of a blue collar connoisseurship anybody can afford to buy the worlds best beers but if you wanted to buy a bottle of the worlds best wine youd have to spend thousands of dollars
927204 your average run of the mill lager will in most states come in around 3 8 or 4 percent alcohol these have got something like 10 or 11 percent so you are getting two and a half times the alcohol delivery with them
927205 youve got to be careful with them but they are self limiting they are very rich it would be like trying to drink a quart of whipping cream your body will reject it because they are so rich
927206 i sell beer for 15 dollars a bottle and i cant make enough of it
927207 i would liken it to the wine industry where people started out liking white zinfandels
927208 then they were ready to move on to things with more flavor like sauvignon blanc then pinot noirs cabernets and other interesting wines
927209 i willfully admit ive got a little bit of an agenda
927210 we are saddled with the same four letter word to describe what we do as what the big brewers do which is b e e r yet it fails to even come close
927211 with more funds on the road than ever before and more established managers taking a larger share of investor commitments private equity real estate fundraising remains very competitive
927212 it is not true that the fire was started by damaged electricity lines
927213 there is always a feeling of anticipation right before you get it all started
927214 there is always anticipation because its the first chance to see the new freshmen you have coming in and to find out what they can do we feel like we recruited well and now well find out just how well we did
927215 thats the no 1 thing we have to figure out
927216 if we can get that position settled it would be a huge deal for us
927217 we cant continue to average just 30 yards on punts like we have the last couple years and keep putting our defense in tough situations
927218 after that the biggest questions we have to answer are probably in our passing game and in our secondary we want to be able to get back to being able to pass the ball the way we did in my first couple of years here and our secondary we want them to do a better job forcing turnovers
927219 we have a whole group of young guys who we will throw out there right off the bat on the first day and see who steps to the forefront
927220 i didnt think i could finish it there at the end
927221 although i was hadnt won i was confident i was going to win
927222 i told everybody that knows me that its just a matter of time its going to come this was a six week run and i was geared up to win im glad that it happened the first week out
927223 it wasnt a good finish for me but i played really well today
927224 im turning 63s and 64s into 70s and thats kind of what happened today i couldnt get any putts to go in then in the end i made some bogeys
927225 i said just cozy it down there if it goes in fine dont leave yourself a 4 footer and i left myself a 4 footer
927226 ive been practicing 4 and 5 footers all week last week and at the end of the day it pays off
927227 i had a putt for what i thought would get me into a playoff
927228 i hit the best putt i could have hit without it going in
927229 our goal is for all people regardless of gender sexuality ethnicity or other such things to have the freedom to create their own identity and be respected for their personal qualities
927230 many parents feel forced to change he to she or she to he and other details as they read stories for their children because so many details in childrens books are so very traditional
927231 based on prejudice or traditional gender roles that rein in individual freedom
927232 break down traditional gender roles and offer children broader role models allowing them to be all they can be
927233 for both vilda and olika their values are the top priority and i think that is simply the wrong approach when you want to make good childrens books
927234 you cannot write a book simply because you want it to be gender equal you can however write a good book that is gender equal but as soon as you can see the thought behind the book i think the artistic side has failed
927235 it is perfectly possible to make good literature that takes these issues into consideration
927236 we have good authors and illustrators and we insist there is a good story that is absolutely the most important thing
927237 our bourse has been losing blood for the last two years a small portion of the exports reaching 200 000 tons is being registered therefore we have decided to get together with exporters merchants agents and brokers to enable voluntary cooperation in particular we want to see exporters purchasing raisins from the exchange
927238 turkish grapes which previously could compete by offering prices below the prices in the united states for years had hard times in competition this season due to high prices
927239 with the decline of the exchange rate europe started to get its grapes from the united states
927240 the decline in prices victimizes producers our aim is to create a realistic market order
927241 the visual history of press photojournalism in turkey from the ottoman period to 1960
927242 the only thing sure other than death and taxes is that deposit insurance premiums will be going up as more banks fail
927243 we are pleased to be in a position to support the fdic in its effort to resolve a problematic situation
927244 a mythic battle between good and evil played out in ancient china
927245 web designers have been given things semantic or at least meaningful class names for years javascript developers have been using class names not to define style but to identify groups of elements that they want to apply dynamic behaviours to
927246 microformats build on the semantic capabilities of the web using existing standards
927247 investors have judged that it is wise to dump shares of toyota and other international blue chips as the u s auto market is now following in the footsteps of the housing market
927248 japanese automakers bleaker output outlooks are certain to affect inventories in a broad range of other related industries including parts makers glass makers and steelmakers
927249 namun di sinilah letak keistimewaan bung hatta ia tidak mau meminta sesuatu untuk kepentingan sendiri dari orang lain bung hatta memilih jalan sukar dan lama yang ternyata gagal karena ia lebih mendahulukan orang lain daripada kepentingannya sendiri

927252 no this is a bar our veg restaurant is across the road
927253 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
927254 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist i think they are cynical
927255 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
927256 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on
927257 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
927258 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
927259 a coalition service member was killed and another wounded when their convoy struck an ied improvised explosive device this morning in kabul
927260 instead of saying we are building on the achievements confronting new challenges we joined in the attack on our own ten years a fatal mistake we junked the tb tony blair policy agenda but had nothing to put in its place
927261 continues to be 100 percent supportive of gordon brown and the government
927262 recently returned from iran and is seeking to re establish his power base
927263 we are discussing with the israelis how to allow the people to return to gaza

927269 we plan to drill in five different oil wells will the partner international company join all of them or some of them if the company considers a strong partnership then its investment could be more than 600 million
927270 production is becoming more and more of a concern for these guys access to reserves is a very big issue
927271 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
927272 we have told the european countries that every country including iran has the right to engage in uranium enrichment and to possess nuclear power stations based on agreements
927273 what matters is that we get a clear answer quickly its not a matter of one day
927274 were in a tight trading range in wheat its at the tail end of harvest and it seems to be well supported
927275 we think around 68 people have died and many are injured
927276 if umno barisan nasional decide to play rough with massive funding and bribery then we will have to be really prepared
927277 voor bedrijven op een specifieke zakelijke hoogtechnologische markt zoals asml is de eigen productie van video voor een relatief beperkte doelgroep van groot belang hier zie je dat de onderneming haar eigen zender wordt we verwachten dat bedrijven meer en meer daartoe overgaan nu nog is de tekst zeer dominant op corporate websites
927278 voor massaproducten is reclame wellicht rendabel maar niet voor de meeste bedrijven en organisaties die zijn beter af met een productie van langere duur tegen lagere kosten waarin ze echt kunnen overbrengen wat hen bezielt
927279 dit is corporate communicatie en geen journalistiek bedrijven houden de regie en huren ons in om de boodschap zo aantrekkelijk mogelijk te brengen
927280 we will expel all the persons of the south side staying in the mt kumgang tourist area we deem unnecessary

927289 only three non eu citizens can play in spanish teams which is obviously a difficult situation for turkish players
927290 but there is something more important than that which is turks wanting and deciding to play abroad
927291 according to the voting results the financial cut was decided by four votes in this case both the court and relevant rules were violated so the ruling is not valid
927292 look 10 of the 11 high court members voted that you are the center of anti laicism so watch your steps from now on
927293 i think i did the best of the worst if you like in the end
927294 i had no idea about the puncture and the team did a great job to help me back into that race and last year i think i lost the championship because of punctures but congratulations to heikki who drove a great race and he deserves his win we have taken points from our rivals today and made the best of things it could have been a whole lot worse
927295 before and immediately after august 8 we will not see persistent heavy rainfall
927296 specifically on the 8th the weather in beijing will be cloudy and overcast and we will see some rain showers and thunder showers
927297 it is impossible to tell at what time the rain will fall on august 8 but we cannot exclude that there will be periodic rain then
927298 and for the moment we can only work with small clouds if the conditions are appropriate we may try to put in some plans
927299 normally a typhoon can affect an area for one or two days
927300 it would not have a long term effect but would only have an effect for a limited period

927302 i dont want to go unless i can do a good result for myself and the team or contribute to a good result for the team so if i dont recover from my injury and am not close to my best i dont mind staying at home
927303 were hopeful that on monday hell get the all clear to fly to beijing

927305 i feel happy because for sure to be no 1 is hard work from a long long time ago
927306 the way he was playing we all thought he was not going to lose any time soon
927307 i tried not to think about his winning streak and his new ranking
927308 during all this tournament i didnt play my best much
927309 the akyatan lagoon is one of the most important wetlands in the ukurova delta climate change and desertification affect the region severely if we add the works to transform the lagoon into farming fields the akyatan is facing death now
927310 starting from the early 1960s wetlands were dried up to prevent malaria projects to convert the land into agricultural fields and the latest drought have negatively affected the amik avlan kestel gavur su la eber and ak ehir lakes as well as the hotam yarma e mekaya and t rko lu reed fields the sultan and ere li reed fields dried up completely right now there are only 500 000 acres of wetlands left the effects of global warming can be seen at the akyatan lagoon which is situated on one of the most important bird migration routes the area should be protected but activities are in the opposite direction
927311 if the political will is there we could achieve an agreement within three or four months
927312 the security issues involved in an agreement i would say are about 95 percent finalized
927313 for to tell the truth we were not expecting with the current situation in washington a real change
927314 it may be that the publicity about our presence here made too many people nervous
927315 we are unhappy to see ourselves demonized whatever we do
927316 at the end of the game you cannot succeed in syria if the perception is you are not trying to change our behavior but change our regime
927317 whether it is obama or mccain the good news is that no one can pursue the policies that president bush tried first its already a stuck policy
927318 anyone who comes next will have to have a different approach
927319 the whole anti secularism accusation against the akp is groundless
927320 the decision of the constitutional court in turkey essentially puts an end to a period of uncertainty and instability in turkeys political life recep tayyip erdo ans government can now proceed with adopting and applying the reforms and adjustments required for the progress toward turkeys course of entry to the european union

927338 if it were not a criminal offense i would say i do not love atat rk i love khomeini
927339 it is a fact that atat rk is not loved by people supporting the return of khlafet islamist radicals and separatists to love or not to love something or somebody is an individual issue if the suspects do not love atat rk atat rk will not lose anything of his importance for this nation because of such an attitude by these girls

927344 moj by emre ny opened its first six stores in turkey the aim is to distribute a further 14 stores throughout turkey the most distinctive aspect of the stores is that they carry only mens accessories

927352 given our positive experience with them on our existing breaking news alert service clickatell was the natural choice to handle cnns beijing 2008 gold medal alerts

927361 the common programme enshrining the hopes and aspirations of all the progressives people of south africa
927362 no government can justly claim authority unless it is based was on the will of the people
927363 existing in a relationship of singularity and externality of transcendence to his principality
927364 the objective of the exercise of power is to maintain strength and protect the principality
927365 science or form of reflection the government of oneself which falls under morality the art of properly governing a family which is part of economy and finally the
927366 these arts of government refer to and postulate an essential continuity from one form to the other
927367 constantly try to make clear the discontinuity between the princes power and other forms of power which involves explaining asserting and founding this discontinuity
927368 the education of the prince assures the upward continuity of forms of government and police assures their downward continuity
927369 the wise government of the house for the common good of the whole family
927370 becoming apparent that the essence of this government that is to say of the art of exercising power in the form of economy will have what we now call economy as its principle object
927371 level of reality and a field of intervention for government
927372 government is the right disposition of things arranged so as to lead to a suitable end
927373 men in their relationships bonds and complex involvements with things like wealth resources means of subsistence and of course the territory with its borders qualities climate dryness fertility and so on
927374 end of sovereignty is internal to itself and gets its instruments from itself in the form of law the end of government is internal to the things it directs
927375 an excessively large abstract and ridged framework of sovereignty on the one hand and on the other a model of the family that was too narrow weak and insubstantial
927376 remained at the level of the formulation of general principles of public law
927377 with the household and the father and the family one hand and the state and sovereignty on the other that art of government could not find its own dimension
927378 the demographic expansion of the 18th century which was linked to the abundance of money which was itself linked in turn to the expansion agricultural production through a set of circular processes
927379 in enabling the specific phenomena of population to be quantified with its own internal regularities of
927380 it will be the object that government will need to take into account in its observations and knowledge in order to govern effectively in a rationally reflected manner
927381 continuous and multiple networks of relationships between the population the territory and wealth
927382 we should not see things as the replacement of a society of sovereignty by a society of discipline and then a society of discipline by a society of say government
927383 sovereignty discipline and governmental management which has population as its main target and apparatuses of security as its essential mechanism
927384 i greatly enjoyed the productive meeting i had with secretary general gurr a at the oecd ministerial council meeting in june i look forward to further discussions with him in melbourne and in particular exchanging views on developments last week in geneva and how the multilateral trading negotiations might be developed from here

927396 oh honey you like it okay well go ask your mom first and if she says yes then ill be happy to paint them for you okay
927397 we are really delighted we finally have justice i want to thank everybody who has supported us throughout these years
927398 we have been fighting for many years and now we need to get back together as a family we hope that the police will look again into the murder of jill dando
927399 i am overwhelmed i want to thank my family my legal team my medical team and all the people who have supported me at belmarsh whitemoor and manchester prisons and all my supporters across the uk
927400 throughout the trial he did not dare to get his hopes up and continually said to me in the dock he believed he would be convicted
927401 his eyes filled with tears and he took a very deep breath
927402 i would be surprised if there was not a claim for compensation for the eight years of suffering plans are already afoot
927403 we are disappointed by todays verdict but especially disappointed for jills family and friends however we respect the decision of the court the investigation into her murder was complex thorough and professional with more than 2 500 statements taken and 3 700 exhibits recovered we would like to thank the members of public who came forward following the murder to give us information in particular those that gave evidence in court
927404 will be reflecting on todays verdict and considering how best to proceed
927405 one of those terrible crimes that will never be solved
927406 in considering a case of this complexity the police and those responsible for the prosecution need to keep an open mind as far as possible as to who is responsible i think they did close their mind after the arrest of barry george
927407 i want to thank my family my legal team my medical team and all the people who have supported me at belmarsh whitemoor and manchester prisons and all my supporters
927408 this is not a time to celebrate barry george an innocent man has spent eight years in prison for a crime he did not commit
927409 those eight years could have been better served by the police in searching for the real killer
927410 we will be reflecting on todays verdict and considering how best to proceed
927411 any result like this is always difficult for family members because it re opens all the old wounds
927412 and that line drawn underneath what happened has now disappeared and there is the prospect of at least a review if not a re investigation into the case

927508 our server systems were about three years old and were reaching their capacity with space and performance which was significantly holding us back in being able to expand the business and cater for the growth the systems did not have redundant power supplies or network cards leaving us open to downtime should a server failure occur
927509 we have calculated that the new system is saving the company 4 000 a week in reclaimed working hours oncore it carried out an annual dr test last month which involved restoring all of our servers and data as if in a data loss emergency and staging a workplace recovery test which all ran quickly and smoothly with no data losses this is very important to us as we store 40 000 job applications on our systems which is highly critical data for our business
927510 all the latest company data is automatically loaded onto the replacement servers ready for us to connect to the new server remotely in a seamless transition to allow for business to continue as usual for further security should the main oncore it data centre fail it has a second data centre in paris that would automatically take over
927511 time consuming minor data losses and server failures as a result of the legacy tape based backup system which did not check that data could be retrieved in a data loss situation
927512 the biggest difference is in the retrieval of the data its all about the restore not the backup data was often corrupt or the tapes were broken when trying to retrieve lost files before so the data would be lost permanently we have not permanently lost a single item of data since oncore its implementation

927532 one of the things ive learnt in my i dont know 40 years or so is the further up the company you go the stupider you become and im probably the living example of that because you start believing your own stuff you start believing youre in touch you know people are just blowing smoke at you all the time so you really are not in touch
927533 the closer you can get down to the consumer to decision making the more ideas youre going to get coming up

927539 this helped us get ready for the start of the school year we bought thousands of books from seven different vendors
927540 it surprisingly turned out to be a very good show
927541 most of us came not expecting a lot i could go home very happy right now two hours before the show officially ends
927542 bookstore owners mostly from independent stores mixed with buyers from small and regional chains kept us busy
927543 hes coalesced the remainders industry into a serious part of the book business
927544 we were surprised and delighted that our sales were as strong as in previous years given the state of the economy there seems to be an unspoken consensus that the bargain book business is particularly appropriate in todays economy if retailers ever needed bargain product its now
927545 we delivered exactly the number of attendees that we had told the vendors to expect almost every vendor said it was a good show especially after the serious decreases in attendance and sales at this years book expo america in los angeles in may and the international christian retail show at orlando fla in july

927551 we have benefited considerably from winlims rentals reporting capabilities our reports vary greatly in format dependent on the type of testing being carried out for each customer winlims was able to cater for this requirement straight from the box and as such has made significant time savings seven hours per week if not more
927552 we typically generate 500 to 600 reports a month with winlims it is all now done automatically we simply select the type of report and based on the type of commodity the system prints out the report we also now have the added benefit that it simplifies trend analysis
927553 reporting had long been a slow part of the process prior to introducing winlims now we get the reports out in less time and with more reliability as well because the report is now automatically generated rather than being generated by a human in the past it was all too easy to try and lash something together in a hurry in word and invariably thats when things could start to go wrong
927554 qsis winlims rental solution offered a cost effective way of obtaining a lims system that was capable of meeting our exacting requirements and also offered a wide range of additional capabilities that would meet our future needs
927555 even if you go and buy a winlims it is still a significant cost up front however with the winlims rental system you can have a really good lims right now

927586 though people come to us with photographs of stars we tell them that what looks good on jolie may not look good on you the various body parts have to be proportionate to the body we use the photographs just to get an idea of what the client wants post operative care is very important and things can go wrong a client who has had breast enhancement has to do some exercises and wear pressure clothing patients who opt for body contouring or liposuction have to watch their diet if they dont follow these procedures the surgery can be a waste
927587 people come with pictures of celebrities and unusual requests we have to bring them down to reality and have a hard time counseling them

927654 most artists work in isolation and rarely go out so this show is a great opportunity for people to display their art and meet other artists
927655 in 1985 we only had about 70 entries so it just keeps growing
927656 we also had a lot of entries from young artists in the region this year which is very promising
927657 there were three separate incidents of supply within 30 days and the pistol concerns me
927658 this was a loaded pistol and even though the medical evidence shows the offender might have difficulty firing it i am sure he could have if he wanted to and there was not much point in having it loaded if it was for show and not to fire
927659 its always disappointing to lose like that but its the injuries we have sustained that is a bit more worrying hopefully we can overcome those in the next couple of weeks
927660 we went into the game with an under strength team because of injuries but there are no excuses tweed wanted to win and they set about doing what they had to
927661 last time they scored a couple of tries on us down the blindside and we wanted to counteract that so we hit it up the blindside ourselves and we found some space
927662 it was a very important game for us we knew it was pretty much make or break for us to stay up the top of the ladder
927663 i cant speak highly enough of the way the boys went about this match
927664 considering we had to chop and change the line up on thursday had players making the step up to the firsts from the lower grades and then had a bout of flu hit us it really shows the commitment and determination within the team and the club to feature in the finals this year
927665 our aim at the moment is just to get a full team on the paddock
927666 weve got some tough games against ballina and another against lennox in the last rounds and weve really got to win them if went want to go all the way through to the semis
927667 any one of the four teams in semis can win it all weve just got to get our best team back from injury

927674 as the fight against aids nears the end of its third decade we are still facing a huge shortfall in resources
927675 the responses to hiv and aids require long term and sustained financing as more people go on treatment and live longer budgets will have to increase considerably over the next few decades in the most affected countries donors will have to provide the majority of the funding
927676 we dare not let down our guard this is an unforgiving epidemic
927677 we are going to be in this for the long haul
927678 every day almost three times as many people become newly infected with hiv as those who start taking antiretroviral therapy
927679 many of us want to be doctors or teachers i want to be a singer but these dreams will only be possible when we have medicines when were accepted in schools and when we can grow up in an atmosphere free from violence stigma and discrimination
927680 we are hoping for more than three million signatures to be sent to the npa the charges against zuma must be withdrawn unreservedly and unconditionally
927681 this sitting of the court has started seven years ago with clandestine guerrilla style tactics by the npa and the scorpions these dirty tricks will not succeed its a political trial theres nothing legal about it
927682 the so called majority ruling by the constitutional court is a minority amongst us because we know that it is a political trial
927683 we will do everything in our power to stop this shenaniganism sic
927684 we are looking forward to making him president of the country next year

927690 we know cristiano ronaldo is an incredible player and we dont have any problem with him joining us
927691 real madrid making an offer is normal manchester united and coach sir alex ferguson dont want this because he is a very important player at united and that is normal too
927692 i think theyre going to have to talk about this and if cristiano ronaldo is coming to real madrid the dressing room is waiting for him
927693 if he came of course the players and the fans would be excited the supporters are used to watching the best players in the world at the bernabeu and cristiano ronaldo is one of the best players in the world
927694 i feel the best of real madrid is the squad and the dressing room and if cristiano is coming here we dont have room for him in the team
927695 but as i said before maybe with the injury to wesley sneijder maybe we need someone else

927716 in the first half of 2008 its premiums were three percent higher than a year ago though this is about half the five to six percent increases which were more widely expected
927717 premiums have been virtually flat in the past five to six years as insurers have used more of their reserves to help keep a lid on prices

927721 het eerste experiment werd gedaan door dr vladimir poponin een quantum bioloog in dit experiment werd een container geleegd er werd een vacu m gecre erd waardoor het enige wat er in achterbleef fotonen waren deeltjes van licht
927722 de distributie de locatie van de fotonen werd gemeten en ze bleken zich compleet willekeurig in de container te vinden
927723 daarna werd het dna verwijderd van de container en de distributie van de fotonen werd opnieuw opgemeten de fotonen bleven geordend in lijn met waar het dna was aangebracht waar zijn de lichtdeeltjes mee verbonden het effect van intentie op de energi n van het universum dus ook op het licht
927724 dit waren experimenten die door de militaire tak werden uitgevoerd
927725 het dna werd in een andere kamer geplaatst en in hetzelfde gebouw
927726 de militaire tak wilde zien hoe ver ze de donor van zijn dna konden scheiden waarbij ze nog steeds dit effect konden behouden
927727 het dna en de donor hadden precies op het zelfde tijdsmoment dezelfde identieke reacties
927728 het derde experiment werd uitgevoerd door het institute of heart math en het uitgeschreven verslag had de titel
927729 dit is het experiment dat direct relateert tot de antrax situatie
927730 wat werd ontdekt was dat het dna zijn vorm veranderde tot relatie tot de gevoelens van de onderzoekers
927731 dit experiment werd later voortgezet bij het testen van hiv positieve pati nten
927732 deze emotionele veranderingen gingen voorbij aan het effect van elektromagnetisme individuen die getraind zijn in diepe liefde waren in staat om de vorm van hun dna te veranderen gregg braden zegt dat dit een nieuw erkende energie vorm illustreert die alles van de creatie met elkaar verbindt
927733 deze energie blijkt een dicht geweven web te zijn dat alle materie verbindt essentieel zijn we in staat om dit web van creatie door middel van onze vibratie te be nvloeden het idee waar we dit hoofdstuk mee begonnen
927734 wat hebben de resultaten van deze experimenten te maken met onze huidige situatie
927735 onthoud dat de wet van het universum is dat we datgene aantrekken waar we onze focus op laten rusten

927754 our research shows that blondes still do have more fun but arent taken as seriously as women with darker hair both at work and play

927761 these findings are significant because the national health and nutrition examination survey shows 58 percent of all current drinkers in the united states reported usual alcohol consumption that exceeded the dietary guidelines and 52 percent of all current drinkers reported at least one episode of binge drinking in the past year
927762 since more than half of current drinkers in our study drank in excess of the dietary guidelines limits and reported binge drinking prevention efforts should focus on reducing alcohol consumption to safer levels
927763 unfortunately few physicians screen their patients about alcohol use or are knowledgeable about guidelines that define low risk or moderate drinking

927775 indeed health physicists and radiation experts agree that most granite countertops emit radiation and radon at extremely low levels they say these emissions are insignificant compared with so called background radiation that is constantly raining down from outer space or seeping up from the earths crust not to mention emanating from manmade sources like x rays luminous watches and smoke detectors
927776 it been receiving calls from radon inspectors as well as from concerned homeowners about granite countertops with radiation measurements several times above background levels
927777 radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking and is considered especially dangerous to smokers whose lungs are already compromised children and developing fetuses are vulnerable to radiation which can cause other forms of cancer
927778 the first sign of a recovery in the housing market will be a rebound in home sales
927779 were not there yet but this is the second month in a row that sales have shown smaller declines than weve been seeing since the last quarter of last year
927780 while the number of sales for both single family homes and condos were down in may these decreases continue to narrow since the start of the year which is definitely a move in the right direction
927781 housing was again the sick man of the industry as levels of activity plunged to a record low
927782 july marked an end to constructors optimism about recovery as spirits were knocked by the persistent and rapid decline in new business and activity
927783 there can therefore be little doubt that the construction sector is now firmly in recession
927784 the construction sector looks to be in for an extended very difficult time this reinforces our belief that the overall economy is more likely than not to contract in the second half of 2008

927788 that autumn i learned from my own experience that a man can cross the threshold of death while occupying a body that is still not dead your blood still circulates and your stomach digests things but psychologically you have completed all your preparations for death and lived through death itself although you have never regarded yourself as a christian sometimes indeed the opposite now you suddenly notice that you have already forgiven everyone who has insulted you

927815 cdcs first estimates from this system reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known results indicate that approximately 56 300 new hiv infections occurred in the united states in 2006
927816 this figure is roughly 40 percent higher than cdcs former estimate of 40 000 infections per year which was based on limited data and less precise methods
927817 though the number of new hiv infections remains unacceptably high
927818 the analysis shows that new infections peaked in the mid 1980s at approximately 130 000 infections per year and reached a low of about 50 000 in the early 1990s
927819 the data really confirm that there is a severe impact of this epidemic among gay and bisexual men in the united states as well as black men and women

927874 there is no minimal age for entering marriage you can have a marriage contract even with a one year old girl not to mention a girl of nine seven or eight this is merely a contract indicating consent the guardian in such a case must be the father because the fathers opinion is obligatory thus the girl becomes a wife but is the girl ready for sex or not what is the appropriate age for having sex for the first time this varies according to environment and traditions in yemen girls are married off at nine ten 11 eight or 13 while in other countries they are married off at 16 some countries have legislated laws forbidding having sex before the girl is 18 the prophet muhammad is the model we follow he took aisha to be his wife when she was six but he had sex with her only when she was nine

927891 he tried to get us into a derelict house he touched me it was nothing horrific but it could have been
927892 it was the start of a sexual assault there were three of us plus a little one and youd think thered have been safety in numbers but we were so frightened of him wed have done anything
927893 this man came up and threatened us saying the nuns wouldnt like to know youre playing here he was right they were scary
927894 we ran into another garden but he followed us he made us stand on a wall said stay there and went looking for somewhere to take us
927895 then he came back and tried to get us into the house he was desperate and really agitated we managed to attract the attention of some people at a bus stop and ran away i thank god those people were there because we were so scared
927896 if the nuns hadnt been so awful wed have told someone i thought it would frighten my parents and didnt dare tell them i only told my mum about it when i was 35

927904 i am very disappointed to learn that luminar are using these tactics to target young and susceptible people to encourage them to drink more

927906 graphene is a great material for electronics but it would be even better if it were possible to create devices with crystallographic edges that is edges where the atoms lie along single lines in the graphene plane
927907 standard etching techniques being used in the semiconductor industry do not allow this sort of fabrication instead they produce rough edges with lots of atomic scale defects that limit the performance of the fabricated devices
927908 top ten reasons youll want to attend the birthday bash
927909 we knew graphene was the strongest material this work confirms it
927910 this is the beginning of a new physics of materials which enables researchers to determine physical parameters and properties in the nano range through highly precise measurements of the atomic spacings this will also provide clues on how these properties may be manipulated in order to gain new functions and better functional performance
927911 we show that antibodies against the t cell cd3 complex anti cd3 adsorbed onto swcnt bundles stimulate cells more effectively than equivalent concentrations of soluble anti cd3 when immobilized on swcnt anti cd3 can activate t cells at concentrations at least an order of magnitude less than antibody alone
927912 stimulation by antibody adsorbed onto swcnt is significantly higher than other high surface area materials activated carbon polystyrene and c60 nanoparticles suggesting unique properties of swcnt bundles for stimuli presentation and activation of t cells
927913 we find that lymphocytes can be effectively stimulated by swcnts
927914 this is important for the field of adoptive immunotherapy which requires efficient activation and proliferation of lymphocytes ex vivo and the generation of large numbers of cells that can be infused back into the patient for efficient immunotherapy single walled carbon nanotube bundles can be adopted as a platform for efficient activation of t cells with patient derived blood when combined with antibody stimuli

927921 this is a fundamental advance in how nanotube circuits are made
927922 now there is no fundamental reason why we couldnt develop nanonet technologies
927923 if you can make a flexible circuit with 100 transistors you can make circuits with 10 000 or more transistors
927924 were using nature as our guide to develop functional stable nanostructures
927925 we have a long way to go but the ultimate goal is to make useful nano structured materials that can function over a wide range of conditions
927926 proteins are precisely folded linear polymer chains of amino acids so we thought why not make a similar polymer chain by linking together non natural amino acids

928027 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program

928033 theres either a significant amount of money behind this or this is state sponsored or this is stuff that was stolen from the former soviet program
928034 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab

928221 that helps them to be the victor instead of the victim of cancer

928243 when i returned to germany last year i found myself really missing the english style of football
928244 that is why i am happy to be here at walsall and cant wait for the season to start

928253 meine aussage im interview bezog sich nicht auf die stasi
928254 in der tat zwei aussagen ihrer mandantin hintereinander gesendet worden beide aussagen stehen jedoch f r sich und sind durch den zusammenschnitt eben nicht manipuliert worden
928255 was haben staatssicherheit und mauertote mit humanistischem erbe zu tun
928256 also jeder staat versucht ja sich sozusagen vor angriffen von au en zu sch tzen
928257 rechtfertigung der stasi und der mauer kein wort zu den opfern stattdessen schl gt die gew hlte nieders chsische landtagsabgeordnete die wiedereinf hrung der staatssicherheit vor wenn nach der revolution der sozialismus wieder eingef hrt wird
928258 ich denke dass wenn man eine andere gesellschaftsform errichtet dass man da so ein organ wieder braucht weil man sich auch davor sch tzen muss dass andere kr fte reaktion re kr fte die gelegenheit nutzen um so einen staat von innen aufzuweichen
928259 wurden die b nder vernichtet verlegt oder gar an staatsschutzorgane weitergegeben

928262 das moderne pr ventiv orientierte strafrecht hat eine blinde stelle die nicht einfach ausgeglichen werden kann ihm fehlt konzeptionell die normative grenze der verh ltnism igkeit von eingriffen das pr ventionsstrafrecht muss deshalb mit hilfe des allgemeinen grundsatzes der verh ltnism igkeit ausgebremst werden wenn es z b im bestreben einer fr hzeitigen verhinderung terroristischer anschl ge zu weit geht dass das immer fter misslingt dass der kriminalpolitische diskurs ma lose forderungen hervorbringt und ein ende solcher forderungen nicht absehbar ist liegt nicht nur darin begr ndet dass die verbrechensfurcht bei uns weit verbreitet ist und als motor f r kontrollversch rfungen wirkt es liegt auch daran dass sicherheitsbed rfnisse strukturell unstillbar sind sicherheit ist nie hergestellt sie ruft immer nach komplettierung denn sie ist emotiv hoch aufgeladen
928263 trotz dieser fortschritte bleibt noch vieles zu tun hierzu d rfte zum einen eine bessere ergebniskontrolle geh ren und hierf r wiederum w re eine fundiertere ausbildung der juristen n tig das bayerische staatsministerium der justiz hat k rzlich in einer internen umfrage bei gerichten und staatsanw lten die auswahlkriterien f r gutachter erkundet die schnelligkeit mit der das gutachten erstellt wird und die bekanntheit des gutachters beim auftraggeber waren jene gesichtspunkte die alle anderen vorschl ge bei weitem bertrafen qualit t der gutachten oder zertifizierung des gutachters spielten bei den antworten praktisch keine rolle

928291 immer mehr kunden tanken nur noch f r zehn euro oder steigen ganz auf ffentliche verkehrsmittel um
928292 die bev lkerung hat jetzt zum ersten mal tats chlich an kaufkraft verloren die inflation ist innerhalb von einem jahr um 3 6 prozent gestiegen die geh lter aber nur um 2 1 prozent
928293 ich glaube nicht dass die franzosen ihr budget f r lebensmittel zur ck schrauben
928294 es ist eine interessante aufgabe einen rechtsrahmen zu entwickeln und fortschritte zu beobachten
928295 die chinesen sind fortschrittlicher als mancher vermutet sie wollen schnell und viel lernen
928296 ich habe da eher eine g nsehaut bekommen wie so viele leute einen messianisch auftretenden politiker so unkritisch bejubeln k nnen da wurde auch beklatscht dass obama mehr deutsche soldaten f r afghanistan gefordert hat das haben viele vermutlich gar nicht gemerkt
928297 wenn die 30 minuten solche allgemeinpl tze verbreitet h tten w ren sie von den medien in der luft zerrissen worden

928300 the mdc wont be swallowed by zanu pf like what happened to pf zanu in 1987 currently there is no government in zimbabwe but just an illegal caretaker government as mdc we are not going to accept any outcome from the ongoing talks in pretoria which doesnt recognize the march 29 elections

928302 you just add the bacteria to btex contaminated water and they go straight to work
928303 glasses are the most viscous of liquids and the most structureless of solids
928304 as such glasses represent the most poorly understood features of both states of matter that makes them a really profound puzzle
928305 if we could understand what it is was in the arrangement of molecules that rendered one patch rigid and another liquid like we would be well on our way to being able to provide a complete account of the glass transition
928306 asaph and i had looked at everything density local structure energy nothing matched the spatial pattern of slow and fast particles it had to be something more subtle
928307 david was interested in looking at the vibrations in these model glasses the results didnt look very promising at first but as we talked about it we began to appreciate there were some real similarities between the pattern of slow vibrations and the pattern of mobile particles
928308 our results strongly suggest that the reason that some children whove been given antibiotics appear to develop asthma is because they had a chest infection and the symptoms of the chest infection in young children can be confused with the start of asthma
928309 antibiotics are then given to treat this respiratory condition which may or may not be asthma and are not a cause as has been previously suggested
928310 however our study still leaves open the possibility that antibiotics have something to do with the development of eczema and itchy skin by four years and allergic hypersensitivity by 15 months

928316 the fact that remuneration must correspond to the true value of performance constitutes an essential element of the social market economy
928317 es ist klar dass die iranische regierung der forderung der internationalen gemeinschaft nach einem stopp der urananreicherung nicht nachkommt und nicht einmal daran interessiert ist dieses zu versuchen
928318 its good for the region that indonesia is setting very high standards for itself because you do need to have in any region a country that says ill be the champion and i think people will be happy to see indonesia as the champion
928319 i think what we have to get used to now is what i call a new democracy in indonesia so therell be different voices therell be critical voices but we have to get used to that at the end of the day im reasonably hopeful that indonesia will ratify the charter
928320 if you dont come together then relatively speaking the capacity for any asean country to provide the balance is limited so i expect asean to become more cohesive because of the new geo political factors in the region
928321 im in charge of the security guards here though there might be some initial difficulties i am willing to learn

928323 first we ensure that these jobs are suitable which is a prerequisite second we explain and clarify the employment procedures and policies in shanghai
928324 but not everyone can come to shanghai because companies need to choose their workers based on their skills and age requirements
928325 but once they register at our employment bureau well keep their details and match them to appropriate jobs when they are made available
928326 im satisfied with their performance but there are some problems for example they find it difficult to adapt to the weather food and they miss their homes
928327 to cope with this i contacted the labour and social security bureau and we invited a psychology professor to help them with any psychological needs they may have
928328 pressures for higher rates are likely to linger on the committee overall we cannot entirely rule out the risk that the committee will sanction higher rates this time
928329 inflationary pressures continue to prevent the mpc from cutting rates in response to the deteriorating real economy
928330 in fact if interest rates change this month they are more likely to go up than down
928331 pubs and restaurants provide plenty of vegetarian options but nine out of 10 coeliac sufferers say they arent being catered for
928332 its easy for restaurants to stock a core range of gluten free foods such as specially made bread biscuits or pizza bases
928333 its difficult to put a price on the new deal but i believe that it could be worth 250 000 within a year it depends on the take up
928334 but when i founded the company i never estimated that there would one day be a market worth 80m in supermarkets alone

928342 da die zeit gegen israel l uft und knapp wird
928343 selbst der amerikanische national intelligence estimate der mit der interpretation furore machte der iran habe sein atomprogramm 2003 wahrscheinlich eingestellt bestreitet nicht da dort eventuell schon 2009 genug hochangereichertes uran f r eine bombe produziert werden k nnte
928344 we judge with moderate confidence that the earliest possible date iran would be technically capable of producing enough heu for a weapon is late 2009 but that this is very unlikely
928345 all agencies recognize the possibility that this capability may not be attained until hervorhebung im original diese passage erw hnt der konkret autor auch nicht
928346 wir nehmen mit hoher gewi heit an da der iran die wissenschaftliche technische und industrielle kapazit t hat m glicherweise atomwaffen herzustellen wenn er sich dazu entscheidet
928347 allein schon da die mullahs ihr atomprogramm berhaupt verheimlichten bis es 2002 von den oppositionellen volksmudjaheddin aufgedeckt wurde l t wenig zweifel an dessen milit rischer ausrichtung
928348 fakten spielen keine wesentliche rolle wenn eine milit rische konfrontation vorbereitet wird
928349 bei den briten und den amerikanern scheinen das berlegungen aus der alten kolonialzeit zu sein oder sie haben etwas mit k nftigen konflikten in der region unter einschlu von china und indien zu tun
928350 south korea is situated astride the main north pacific shipping route with yeosu and ulsan possessing deep water ports and proximity to chinese and japanese industrial centres that make them ideal choices for the oil hub endeavour

928356 information officers will also need to be aware of the myriad concerns of different segments of the population and their potential reactions and sensitivities to any policy
928357 they facilitate and undertake public consultation that allows the government to better understand ground sentiments perceptions and readiness for new policies
928358 take for instance the policy of means testing in public hospitals this was a potential powder keg which eventually gained the understanding and support of the people
928359 through dialogue sessions which reached out to more than 4 000 people strategic engagement of its stakeholders and integrated communications efforts the ministry of health was able to reach out to its target audiences address their queries and concerns and convey its main messages and assurances
928360 two dutch climbers were brought by our people and their colleagues down to base camp from an altitude of 7 300 metres overnight
928361 they were then picked up by army helicopter from base camp this morning and have now been shifted to hospital for treatment for severe frostbite
928362 our four high altitude porters left a while ago and it is expected that they will bring the italian climber down this evening
928363 badly affected and it appears that at least one of them would have his hand and leg chopped off this is what our high altitude doctors believe
928364 at least 11 climbers have died this is one of the worst incidents in the history of k2 climbing
928365 i have carried down both living and dead people from the mountain
928366 i was terrified that the pakistani would pull us all off the cliff and screamed to him to use his ice axe but he lost his grip and plummeted off a 300 metre cliff

928400 penso che non riuscir mai a ripagare i debiti che ho fatto per studiare certi giorni penso che quando morir avr ancora le rate delluniversit oggi ho un piano per restituire il prestito che dura 27 anni e mezzo ma mi pare troppo ambizioso perch il tasso variabile e riesco solo a pagare gli interessi sono sicura che quando compir sessantanni i debiti della scuola di legge saranno ancora l a farmi compagnia
928401 ma ho lo stesso debito adesso di quando ho finito la scuola perch ogni mese riesco a fare soltanto il pagamento minimo che copre a malapena gli interessi sul capitale che mi hanno prestato e siccome la rata anche salita insieme ai tassi dinteresse non ho fatto nessun passo avanti
928402 per sopravvivere ho dovuto trovarmi un secondo lavoro faccio il tutor per alcuni studenti la sera e durante il fine settimana e accetto ogni lavoretto che mi passa per le mani solo cos posso permettermi di vivere da sola prima di fare la scuola di legge avevo lavorato per due anni nel settore non profit ma mi ero subito resa conto che senza un master non avrei mai potuto accedere ai livelli di lavoro che pi mi piacevano e cos la specializzazione in legge mi sembr la scelta migliore ma la mia famiglia non era in grado di pagare la retta n io avevo soldi per farlo cos ho chiesto due prestiti uno pubblico e uno privato
928403 avevo scelto di andare proprio a villanova perch l davano una borsa di studio chiamata public service che copriva ben il cinquanta per cento della retta se tu ti impegnavi a lavorare nel settore pubblico nei primi cinque anni dopo la fine degli studi questo mi impedisce oggi di fare lavori pi remunerativi ma ho anche la met dei debiti dei miei compagni di corso
928404 negli ultimi dieci anni due milioni di studenti meritevoli non hanno potuto frequentare luniversit perch non avevano i soldi necessari
928405 e inaccettabile ripete obama unamerica in cui non puoi mettere a frutto il tuo talento perch non sei ricco di famiglia perfino la retta dei college cresciuta del 40 per cento negli ultimi cinque anni e cos lingresso al college che per generazioni di americani stato il passaporto per un futuro migliore oggi un sogno che per molti sta svanendo
928406 io sono la meno indebitata della mia classe la maggior parte dei miei compagni di scuola che non hanno avuto la borsa di studio e oggi lavorano come avvocati negli studi privati devono restituire una cifra che va da 120 a 150mila dollari io nel settore pubblico guadagno 45mila dollari lordi lanno loro almeno 20mila dollari in pi per chi ha trovato posto in un piccolo studio legale prende intorno ai 65mila dollari ma avendo il doppio dei debiti se la passa ben peggio visto che deve pagare pi di mille dollari al mese chi invece entrato nellempireo negli studi con pi di 500 avvocati guadagna oltre 100mila dollari allanno del gruppo di amici con cui ho studiato eravamo in cinque ben tre hanno scelto di fare lavori che non amano e che anzi detestano per poter estinguere il debito
928407 sto attentissima a come spendo i soldi segno su un quaderno ogni spesa che faccio dal caff al biglietto dellautobus perch devo tenere ogni cosa sotto controllo se voglio arrivare alla fine del mese
928408 non penso esistesse un altro modo volevo davvero andare a quella scuola e leducazione che ho ricevuto mi permette di poter fare il lavoro che desideravo senza la scuola di legge questa carriera non sarebbe stata possibile ma non mi basteranno trentanni per ripagare il debito ho unamica di famiglia che si laureata a villanova 15 anni prima di me e aveva un prestito simile ora ha avuto dei figli e lavora part time e non riesce sempre a pagare le rate
928409 io penso che sia osceno che un ragazzo debba indebitarsi per tutta la vita per poter studiare

928426 although financial stocks rallied sharply during mid july we believe the gains will be short lived we expect that the negative effects of continued home price declines and contracting credit will lead to a decline in consumer spending and in turn a decline in u s gdp
928427 as the economy weakens we expect credit costs will continue to rise resulting in weaker financial earnings the need for additional capital and lower stock prices for financials
928428 will continue to deleverage for the foreseeable future more than likely shedding assets and raising capital until their leverage levels decline well into the teens

928430 he worked yesterday just like any other day then in the evening death came quickly i am in mourning but i also express gratitude to everyone who will remember this moment remember solzhenitsyn
928431 until the end of his days he fought for russia not only to move away from its totalitarian past but also to have a worthy future to become a truly free and democratic country we owe him a lot
928432 like millions of citizens solzhenitsyn lived through tough times he was one of the first to talk about the inhumane stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken
928433 changed the consciousness of millions of people forcing them to think more about the past and the present
928434 we will remember him as a strong brave person with enormous dignity
928435 his intransigence his ideals and his long eventful life make of solzhenitsyn a hero from a novel an heir to dostoyevsky he belongs to the pantheon of world history

928484 as an example finucane describes a patient who came to him with chest pains heart disease an irregular heartbeat and a spot on her lungs that looked like it could have been cancer

928551 mccain and obama were on the same side blasting the liberals decision striking down laws that allowed the death penalty for child rape
928552 yes chloe he was real he came from a real political family he was a real writer of books on subjects beyond himself he was a real war hero and he had real senatorial accomplishments
928553 i echo the sentiment that obama hasnt given me much reason to vote for him to some extent mccain has given me the most reason to vote obama i strongly believe it is absolutely vital that if america is to be the great country we can be we need a period of stark clean separation from the policies of the bush administration and someone smart eager and energetic to get us through the first years of healing
928554 mccain has given me the most reason to vote obama

928558 in case you havent noticed craig is a member of the press and he is reporting it
928559 but even if he hasnt founded cities destroyed monsters or led men into battle obama does share one quality with the heroes of the ancient world an absolute conviction that he is superior to the ordinary run of humanity like them obama believes himself a man of destiny and like them obama will go over the edge what we can be sure of is that obama will not avoid the final reckoning the last and strangest characteristic of the victim of hubris is that he appears to welcome his fate almost embracing it cooperating in his own downfall so it will be with barack obama but he must not be allowed to take the country with him

928586 the lot of negroes in this country has always touched me i have lived among them all my life but for a long time the whole subject of our effect on one another seemed to me so painful so obscure that i did not dare broach it i used to wonder if a white person could ever really know how a negro felt i still wonder

928591 u s district judge john bates disagreed he said theres no legal basis for that argument he said that miers must appear before congress and if she wants to refuse to testify she must do so in person
928592 harriet miers is not immune from compelled congressional process she is legally required to testify pursuant to a duly issued congressional subpoena

928601 i thought the whole 200 000 in germany heil obamessiah thing was fishy because my berlin buddies keep making fun of me for living in a country where a 12 year old coke head is about to become president when i asked them to look into it they told me what really happened reamonn garvey and patrice were playing think of it as the german equivalent a free concert in the park with the red hot chili peppers and ziggy marley the german and belgian beer distributors were running free beer for the first three hours small cup followed by marked up full size cups after everybody was hot and drunk whatever his speech or message was is then completely lost on the drunk club kids waving banners they were given and cant read and american flags because they think the american flag is funny and ironic i e evil they cant display swastikas to be edgy because it is prohibited by german law

928604 while coverage of senator obamas berlin speech provided audiences here at home nothing less that a visual
928605 theres another reason to name clinton vp he needs someone to answer the questions

928609 seagen is a hugely exciting project as well as an historic achievement for both marine current turbines and for renewables in the uk and ireland tidal energy has the great advantage of being predictable and no other system can harness the power of the tidal currents in the way this one can we take great pride and see enormous potential in the technology and hope it will eventually make a significant contribution to the future energy needs of the british isles ireland and beyond
928610 most of the locations where there are good tidal streams are not locations where there are good steady winds
928611 ford supplied the trucks and they asked us to use them as much as we can they wanted to know how their technology would work in real world circumstances
928612 the fuel cell not only powers the car wash but also heats the water we dont use all the power thats being produced so we actually turn the switch and actually send power to the b c hydro power grid
928613 after the conversion there was virtually no performance difference whatsoever the power and torque remained the same
928614 why not just install a fuel cell or gas turbine ice generator on site to recycle electricity
928615 while im not a gm fan the decision to only make the all electric range 40miles is likely an economic tradeoff
928616 our surveys show the public really want better cup holders
928617 whether or not this is a rational concern from an engineering perspective wont matter its the perceived risk that makes the civil transportation application a no no
928618 while exacerabating the most serious problems of capital cost and complexity
928619 it makes a lot more sense to advance this field of research than investing more in fission when there is a finite amount of recoverable uranium
928620 i dont understand why a lot more than 11 isnt feasible
928621 about 10 000 juneau residents briefly lost power after a bald eagle lugging a deer head crashed into transmission lines
928622 its just a matter of taking a little time and effort to get it done rather than talking about why it wont work

928627 the craft fair was very good because it wasnt much of a beach day
928628 i am a strong supporter of affirmative action when properly structured so there it is not a quota
928629 after spending millions of dollars in key battleground states this summer it appears that barack obama has not improved his numbers in any substantial way and may have lost ground in some places polls showing most american undecided about the illinois senator and believe him to be the riskier choice in the contest for president
928630 rather than engage in divisive ballot initiatives we must have a dialogue and cooperation and mutual efforts together to provide every child in america to fulfill their expectations
928631 i cant see this as much of an issue in the context of the other bigger and more pressing issues the campaigns will have to address in the runup to november
928632 one problem with this is that the major contractors will often create a
928633 and why did senators mccaskill and obama reportedly insert the following clause
928634 whereas previous presidential candidates were born outside of the united states of america and were understood to be eligible to be president
928635 people need to stand for themselves if they are good it they have the credentials if they show the ability and promise they will get hired
928636 but i think he still carries a lot of that sense of entitlement without actually having to do anything
928637 she would take a job and stay as long as she liked then move on
928638 there is no friggin way they can nominate this guy hes got recurring malignant cancer for crying out loud
928639 unless the republicans just flat dont care this time out
928640 is it really any surprise that an issue such as affirmative acion amp calling for the ending of racial preferences would not be introduced by the republicans
928641 what these polls indicate to me is that the election continues to be up for grabs
928642 there was and is no evidence of recurrence or metastasis meaning spread of the invasive melanoma nearly eight years after the surgery the prognosis for sen mccain is good because the time of greatest risk for recurrence of invasive melanoma is within the first few years after the surgery
928643 what these polls indicate to me is that the election continues to be up for grabs
928644 remember obama is running on being post racial this is a no brainer for mccain first he loses nothing as obama is going to get all the aas and their supporters
928645 bush got into yale as a legacy barry and michelle got into the ivies via affirmative action
928646 if bo had even won an academic scholarship hed make sure that the world knew about it
928647 senator i knew jack kennedy jack kennedy was a friend of mine senator youre no jack kennedy
928648 senator ron wyden d or wrote to the public interest declassification board pidb last week to request that it review the classified opinions of the foreign intelligence surveillance fis court from the last ten years and make recommendations regarding their classification or declassification
928649 mccain did well in academic subjects that interested him such as literature and history but studied only enough to pass subjects he disliked such as math
928650 this morning we have updated the last stand email initiative to stop the nomination of barack obama has passed the 136 000 mark
928651 in my many years on college campuses i never met a student who was indeed admitted with an affirmative action decision that wasnt qualified
928652 the future is what matters another decade or two of allowing the maggots to hollow out the constitution could make that already dicey future grim indeed avoiding it if that is possible means first off putting away the perfume and inhaling deeply of the stink doing so properly requires not the wussy half hearted half assed wink and a nod investigation that were all too familiar with but a thorough ruthless hard core full bore no questions evaded probe that not only digs deep but also goes as far back as needed to get the whole picture even if that means taking up where frank church left off 33 years ago
928653 while the mccain campaign will certainly be delighted with the results of the survey several caveats bear mentioning first the polls results are at variance with gallups daily tracking poll which shows a 9 point lead for obama second although it is a gallup poll considered the gold standard of presidential polling it is only one result and will likely change several times throughout the summer third in the same poll sen mccain is shown as trailing obama among the larger group of registered voters by 3 points not all registered voters vote however and a lead among likely voters is generally considered by pollsters to be more significant as an indicator of the eventual election outcome the obama campaign can take comfort in some of those same caveats but the polls result has to be very troubling for the illinois senators effort the campaign has been talking openly of preparing for a presidential transition and has been chastised recently by reporters for acting too much like a white house in waiting besides serving as a dose of reality for a campaign that has perhaps been flying a little too high the result should spur the obama campaign to take a serious look at its message obama has been primarily basing his appeal on his personal judgment and potential but voters tend to vote on specifics and the obama campaign has been short on the kinds of concrete plans that voters typically look for from presidential candidates in other words obama will have to demonstrate to voters that he is more than just an eloquent speaker to win the election
928654 i know the republicans havent come out with much ammunition against him yet but lets be realistic you know theyre laying low cause theyre still afraid of hillary at the convention right they know if shes the nominee they are toast so theyre gonna play possum through august 29th but after labor day let the games begin if senator obama is performing this poorly in the polls with his huge financial and press advantage and rock star treatment i wonder what will happen when
928655 the poll showed a surge since last month in likely republican voter amp suggested obamas trip may have helped energize voters who favor mccain
928656 registered voters are much more important at the moment he said mccains lead among likely voters suggests the possiblitys there that republicans can get energized
928657 my wife had to listen to a female passenger talk about her sex life the night before
928658 they get on a cell phone and its like a megaphone who wants to listen to that certainly not when youre trapped on an airplane
928659 theres no reason for the u s to eliminate modern communications or make them inaccessible
928660 if were going to start banning cell phones i think there are a number of other things ipods and dirty diapers would be on my wishlist
928661 greyhound spokeswoman abby wambaugh said 37 passengers and one driver were on the bus
928662 theres another reason to name clinton vp he needs someone to answer the questions
928663 hillary this is barry uh uh could you hold a press confess and explain to them what i meant if you had said that
928664 house panel votes to block cellphone use on domestic flights a bill that seeks to prevent the use of cellphones on domestic passenger airliners was approved thursday by a house panel
928665 house panel votes to block cellphone use on domestic flights a bill that seeks to prevent the use of cellphones on domestic passenger airliners was approved thursday by a house panel
928666 oh mate you didnt give me the right change which they switch with their backs to the worker i hate cell phones i despise them
928667 during the campaign hillary and i didnt have the chance to eat together much because we were usually on the trail in different states now that the campaigns over im glad we can share more meals again
928668 ah luuv breakin bread with hillary not too big on sleepin with her but bread breakin is just fiiine
928669 sometimes we have responsibility to consider the comfort of others beyond just ourselves
928670 they get on a cell phone and its like a megaphone who wants to listen to that
928671 i humbly request you attempt to avoid taking my reply the wrong way
928672 that is why mccain is hammering obama with the off shore drilling it is a winning issue for those of us without a coast it is a no brainer
928673 but is spending a lot in the mn mi pa ohio iowa
928674 his original birth certificate with the name barack h obama was sealed
928675 the issue of iraq is not whether rummy did a poor job of executing the war or that increasing the troops would affect the level of opposition or violence but it was having the good sense and better understanding of not going in there in the first place
928676 mccain is preying on that anxiety of those with no brains by offering offshore drilling as a quick fix
928677 he has shown no interest in doing anything but continuing more of the same failed policies that have produced the highest oil and gas prices ever
928678 the democrats are pushing for shrub to release oil from the strategic reserve
928679 i wonder of mccain has a voodoo doll of bush
928680 maybe she is tough what she isnt is professional in her demeanor or behavior unless of course she is thinking of replacing matthews when he retires
928681 lets face it jamie anyone who doesnt kiss clinton ass you have scorn for frankly i find your assessment absurd
928682 it was a cool summer morning in or about the ides of june when the sun arose slowly stirring the floral inhabitants of an undisclosed region of pennsylvania
928683 so i wonder if the fund for the bombing of the indian embassy came from the aid we provide to pakistan posted by brianinnyc july 31 2008 11 15 pm
928684 if we dont puncture his balloon this summer he will float right out of our hands
928685 still with mccain doing so much of the heavy lifting in his personal remarks and television advertisements he runs the risk of nurturing his own negative narrative as ill tempered and angry
928686 anything in the democratic pipeline that will build the theme that mccain is a decrepit and out of touch idiot
928687 whatever maybe you dont desire to broaden your exposure to people from different ethnic background
928688 i know tim kaine personally he is a catholic whose concern extends to having done missionary work in honduras
928689 a local election watched by abortion partisans across the land
928690 phil kline and steve howe are fighting a contentious republican primary race over who should be the next district attorney in johnson county kan the wealthy suburb just outside kansas city
928691 with mccain doing so much of the heavy lifting in his personal remarks and television advertisements he runs the risk of feeding his own negative narrative as ill tempered and angry
928692 the us attorney could have a warrant issued likely enforced by us marshalls
928693 olmert ill quit as pm when kadima picks new leader
928694 mccain in a deeply cynical ploy to misinform is lying about obama any lie is bad enough but to impugn senator obama in way that also abuses our troops is not only wrong but political slime this is an act of unpatriotic desperation
928695 hidden deep in senator christopher dodds 630 page senate housing legislation is a sweeping provision that affects the privacy and operation of nearly all of americas small businesses the provision which was added by the bills managers without debate this week would require the nations payment systems to track aggregate and report information on nearly every electronic transaction to the federal government
928696 sweeping provision that affects the privacy and operation of nearly all of americas small businesses
928697 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
928698 oh come patsi at your age no one expects you to remember the first time you were called a bitch
928699 when you supported ford for speaker i thought you were a cougar with the fever lol
928700 think we the people are ready for and need a civil president who isnt all repub ill will and rancor
928701 i agree on tin roof blowdown it made it more personal didnt it i love burkes entire dave robicheaux series have you read them too
928702 enter the 75 000 people who will have to come hours early for obamas acceptance speech to get through security most carrying cell phones
928703 there will be a lot of idle time we put idle people to work
928704 hildebrand said the campaign has identified 55 million unregistered voters across the country
928705 as a usenet discussion grows longer the probability of a comparison involving nazis or hitler approaches one
928706 the rule does not make any statement whether any particular reference or comparison to hitler or the nazis might be appropriate but only asserts that one arising is increasingly probable it is precisely because such a comparison or reference may sometimes be appropriate godwin has argued 4 that overuse of nazi and hitler comparisons should be avoided because it robs the valid comparisons of their impact
928707 obama needs to humanize himself his campaign has done too good a job of apotheosizing him a good start would be for obama to apologize to clinton supporters for not coming to her defense during the primaries and helping her battle a torrent of sexist media criticism mccain the soldier conversely needs to get disciplined and promote a rock solid economic message he needs to convince swing voters that he will do a better job of righting the economy than a rookie senator with little by way of a legislative record this race is still the democrats to lose but by going overboard on unity and turning unity to hubris they can still easily lose it
928708 people who yes may be just getting introduced to politics its a good thing and it scares the daylights out of republicans
928709 technical experts techdude and polarik still maintain that the certification of live birth colb published on the obama campaigns official website fightthesmears was forged current theory of events 2 obama was adopted by lolo soetoro in hawaii sometime around 1965 1966 4 mother and son joined soetoro in indonesia where barry soetoro was registered in school as lolos son a muslim and a citizen of indonesia if the above stated hypotheses are correct obamas current birth certificate in hawaii would identify him as barry soetoro and his father would be lolo soetoro unless as stated there was another adoption upon request by the registrant sen obama the state of hawaii would issue a colb in the name of soetoro for child and father is this why the senator has avoided showing his birth certificate and is this why if polarik and techdude are correct the colb published by obama has been altered
928710 we had such a legacy such a history we couldnt escape it even if we tried
928711 we cant seriously be contemplating electing this megalomaniac president can we
928712 this is the moment as nancy pelosi noted that the world is waiting for
928713 i think champ may have a point to talk about the german public
928714 jesus knew what he was doing when he picked peter to build his church
928715 the good old days when hillary was being mercilessly trashed by the obama supporters
928716 returning troops blunt iraq as campaign issue in new hampshire
928717 iraq new hampshire voters second biggest issue in april dropped to fourth place with 8 percent picking it as their top concern
928718 why then didnt hochul get the assignment why did it go to someone whose meager experience fell short of even the minimum posted requirements for the job the answer is as you angry white males out there may have guessed affirmative action only this program wasnt aimed at gender equality or ethnic diversity and it was more aggressively single minded than the standard preferential treatment hochul lost the assignment because hiring practices at the justice department gave an extra boost to a completely different sort of group republicans
928719 secret information that we cant reveal without tipping off the terrorists
928720 the daily iraq violence report is compiled by mcclatchy newspapers special correspondents in baghdad from police military and medical reports this is not a comprehensive list of all violence in iraq much of which goes unreported
928721 i hope congress spits in the face of bush on this offshore drilling
928722 it would appear that in the state of hawaii you can have more than one birth certificate if you happen to have been adopted
928723 measure how a particular choice will be received by the news media their supporters and those in their party who marginally back the presumed presidential nominee
928724 improvement in mentaly impair services has lead to a decline in their rate of homelessness
928725 in general the number of people panhandling on street corners has dramatically increased in the last 3 years
928726 does obama counterbalance his relative inexperience in general and in foreign policy and defense matters in particular and go with a trusted old timer or pick a fresh face someone who can pose as an agent of change a relative newcomer just like himself
928727 some of the information that was put out in my e mail was wrong
928728 as the soldiers where sic lined up to shake his hand he blew them off and didnt say a word as he went into the conference room to meet the general
928729 shunned the opportunity to talk to soldiers to thank them for their service i swear we got more thanks from the nba basketball players or the dallas cowboy cheerleaders than from one of the senators who wants to be the president of the united states i just dont understand how anyone would want him to be our commander in chief it was almost that he was scared to be around those that provide the freedom for him and our great country
928730 i am writing this to ask that you delete my e mail and not forward it after checking my sources some of the information that was put out in my e mail was wrong this e mail was meant only for my family please respect my wishes and delete the e mail and if there are any blogs you have my e mail portrayed on i would ask if you would take it down too
928731 there were discrepancies in the e mail but i am not at liberty to say more
928732 we were a bit delayed as he took time to shake hands speak to troops and pose for photographs
928733 i am writing this to ask that you delete my e mail and not forward it after checking my sources some of the information that was put out in my e mail was wrong this e mail was meant only for my family please respect my wishes and delete the e mail and if there are any blogs you have my e mail portrayed on i would ask if you would take it down too
928734 please note that the back channelers were fast with the links
928735 i may not be a major obama fan but i really hate this stuff and the people who use it
928736 i suspect that there are large numbers of people that will believe that e mail about obama
928737 hey if youre even mildly derogatory toward my messiah youve insulted me too
928738 heres something we are seeing a lot of on the blogs the last day or so speculation that john edwards
928739 about tim kaine i understand that he opposes a womans right to choose wow if that is true then i will not be able to support the democratic ticket sen obama would again be undercutting the rights of women
928740 you dont have to answer post all you want but since you rarely say anything yourself it gets hard to understand who you are in terms of these posts
928741 you dont have to answer post all you want but since you rarely say anything yourself it gets hard to understand who you are in terms of these posts
928742 so it appears that in order to solve the population issue people have to get rich and use a lot of resources and energy per capita so they have less children in order to curb total resource and energy use in the long run
928743 an economic system in which the rich are striving to get richer forever is sooner or later going to collapse in a finite world
928744 taken together these technologies represent what we see as the best in the cellulosic ethanol future and cover the spectrum in science and commercialization demonstrating the viability of sustainable non grain based ethanol is critical to developing the infrastructure to support the flex fuel vehicle market one of the things that attracted us to mascoma was its r amp d team their development of best in class microorganisms and enzymes could lead a transformation to a new era of biofuels
928745 cellulosic ethanol will never be a ghg solution according to recent studies it emits one and a half times the co2 of gasoline
928746 poor down trodden luke more than a billion people on this planet do not have access to electricity and clean water luke whines about the cost of something while communicating on the internet using an expensive computer
928747 abe lincoln never used electricity in that tradition you can not be poor if you have access to a good library
928748 missouri city produces as much electricity from wind as they consume
928749 its generally a good idea to do the math before you go around knocking down imaginary strawmen in my humble opinion
928750 what would happen if we replaced all fossil plants with wind solar without building any more nuclear plants
928751 mjmu will supply rock ports power needs when the wind turbines are not generating at capacity
928752 dont get the idea that ive turned green my business is making money and i think this is going to make a lot of money
928753 the equivalent of building two commercial scale nuclear power plants
928754 a 4 000 mws wind farm runs 20 of the time us onshore average
928755 we are the third largest emitter of co2 in the united states emitting more than 100 million tons last year
928756 we are assessing what it would take to cut our co2 emissions in half by 2030 and the implications of such an effort
928757 pickens certainly thinks big and somebody has to as the u s government is doing little to resolve our compounding needs for new power sources
928758 phes has higher round trip efficiency and is truly a storage system as it does not require external inputs to recapture the electricity phes also has a lower operating cost due to the natural gas input required for caes
928759 eestors game changing energy storage technology is in the advanced stages of commercialization
928760 eestor has publicly committed to commercialization in 2008 and their first production line will be used to supply zenn motor company
928761 based on past performance a wait and see position must be held
928762 for example weve been attributing too many emissions to the northeastern united states and its looking like the southeastern u s is a much larger source than we had estimated previously
928763 when you compare the old inventories to vulcan the new data show atmospheric co2 differences that are as large as five parts per million in some u s regions in the late winter the levels in the global atmosphere only rise one and a half part per million every year so this is the equivalent of three years of global emissions in the atmosphere that isnt where we thought it was this will be important for policy makers and is enormous from a scientific point of view its shocking
928764 the high resolution map from vulcan also provides a picture of emission sources in a way that the public and policy makers can understand which may be helpful in discussing what we will do about the climate problem
928765 provides a picture of emission sources in a way that the public and policy makers can understand which may be helpful in discussing what we will do about the climate problem
928766 these measurements will be combined with data from the ground based network to provide scientists with the information that they will need to better understand the processes that regulate atmospheric co2 and its role in the carbon cycle
928767 doing better experiments is likely to reveal more of reality than doing phony experiments
928768 plant lots of plants burn them in steam turbines generate electricity go to phevs sequester co2 from steam turbines problem solved next problem
928769 resulting in a drop in ph levels and ocean acidification
928770 solar power at 5 cents per kwh would be a world changing breakthrough it would make solar generation of electricity as affordable as generation from coal natural gas or other non renewable sources without requiring a subsidy
928771 in a little more than a year we were able to develop and successfully test xcpv we expect the sunrgi system to become available for both on and off grid power applications worldwide in twelve to fifteen months
928772 system simulation of multiple module arrays within a low profile horizontal two axis frame structure
928773 i wonder if you would consider allowing some of your fans here to post articles if you are pushed for time
928774 polysilicon factories in china are notorious for ignoring basic safe disposal of toxic waste byproducts from polysilicon production pollution is so bad a lot of athletes are worried about clean water air and food at the olympics in beijing
928775 this will depend on whether solar pv modules can reach the price target of under 1 00 per wp that have been promised by some
928776 why the climate is not highly sensitive to co2 warming
928777 invalidate all the concern about global warming and make the future much less of a concern
928778 i find it insane that i am still forced to explain this
928779 ummm even if the connection were to not exist i suggest we could all improve our lifestyles if we ditched our stinking cars and started to design cities that are walkable rather than just driveable
928780 ummm even if the connection were to not exist i suggest we could all improve our lifestyles if we ditched our stinking cars and started to design cities that are walkable rather than just driveable
928781 ummm even if the connection were to not exist i suggest we could all improve our lifestyles if we ditched our stinking cars and started to design cities that are walkable rather than just driveable
928782 the new information coming out does make the issue more grey
928783 the new information coming out does make the issue more grey
928784 we were wrong this new data or analysis disproves what we earlier believed
928785 the esolar power plant is based on mass manufactured components and designed for rapid construction uniform modularity and unlimited scalability rather than over engineering the solution esolars smart scalable solar architecture targets what we see as the four key business obstacles facing the sector price scalability rapid deployment and grid impact
928786 real estate tends to be a premium at the same place where energy demand is
928787 and there are probably sturdy grid ties already in place
928788 when you look east you see areas of south carolina georgia mississippi in the se us a large fraction of the insolation is diffused through clouds so concentrating solar systems are less effective
928789 in january you get 4 to 5 kwh per m2 per hour in july you get 5 to 6
928790 nevada solar one for example is contracted for 98 solar fraction 2 natural gas
928791 the solar day is now 24 hours long according to john odonnell ausras executive vice president he said spanish solar thermal power station andasol is currently running 24 7 and has a 16 hour storage reservoir
928792 taking the path of least resistance policymakers pay little attention to curbing energy consumption until supplies run short likewise despite much rhetoric greenhouse gas emissions are not seriously addressed until major shocks trigger political reactions since these responses are overdue they are severe and lead to energy price spikes and volatility
928793 renewable energy simply cannot be brought up to speed fast enough to meet all our needs
928794 stopping manufacturing these things would not force us to turn out the lights in fact eliminating such things would make it easier to keep the lights on
928795 i believe that congress will recognize that it is critical not only to this project but to renewable energy in this country that they enact a long term extension of the production tax credits
928796 you find an oilfield it peaks and starts declining and youve got to find another one to replace it
928797 it can drive you crazy with wind theres no decline curve
928798 i believe that congress will recognize that it is critical not only to this project but to renewable energy in this country that they enact a long term extension of the production tax credits
928799 state level incentives such as laws requiring utilities to purchase clean energy are bolstering growth in the sector
928800 will permit the united states to become less dependent on foreign oil
928801 that does not mean that stand by spinning coal is likely to be the solution a decade from now
928802 in my area were gearing up for a new wind farm the natural gas peaker standby plants are getting upgraded turbines that can go from a standstill to full speed in less than 15 minutes
928803 if you pick ineffective solutions to solve a problem you will still have the problem decades from now
928804 it has developed software that does an up to the minute analysis of natural gas propane oil and electricity rates and can switch a customer between electricity and fossil fuels whenever the rate is lowest
928805 payback of just three years this is because natural gas tends to be cheaper than electricity during the day but more expensive at night
928806 why do i always run across discussions aimed at monolithic solutions
928807 it would appear that me2 is missing the point energy facilities must meet higher standards than his daddys farm
928808 judging from the number of deaths and significant injuries related to anhydrous ammonia the risk is not easy to mitigate
928809 a properly written eis would describe the feedstock sources for the the ethanol plant and the safety practices that would be followed just for the record many of the farms i have visited meet the highest standards for safety and respect for the environment
928810 biofuels are terrible in that they have a poor overall energy balance
928811 anhydrous ammonia is very toxic to bacteria when you kill the bacteria holding the soil together the first strong wind creates a dust bowl
928812 while ethanol from switchgrass can produce about five times more energy than you put in when you factor in the energy required to make tractors transport farm equipment plant and harvest and so on the net energy output of switchgrass is about 20 times better than corns
928813 bransbys a switchgrass farmer in alabama 6 year average 11 5 tons a year translates into about 11 500 gallons of ethanol per acre an added bonus is the electricity that can be produced from the leftover portions of the crop that wont convert to ethanol
928814 farmers will often transport anhydrous ammonia from fertilizer plants in trailer tanks hooked to pickup trucks or tractors the material is not dangerous when handled properly but if not handled carefully it can be extremely dangerous
928815 producing ethanol from corn requires almost as much energy to produce as it yields
928816 while ethanol from switchgrass can produce about five times more energy than you put in when you factor in the energy required to make tractors transport farm equipment plant and harvest and so on the net energy output of switchgrass is about 20 times better than corns
928817 our business model has been focused on proving the commercial feasibility of the firms algae to biofuels technology during the past eighteen months whether we have arrived at this point in time by a superior technological approach sheer luck or a redneck can do attitude the fact remains that microalgae can outperform the current feedstocks utilized for conversion to biodiesel and ethanol yet do not impact the consumable food markets or fresh water resources
928818 from 1978 to 1996 the u s department of energys office of fuels development funded a program to develop renewable transportation fuels from algae
928819 in 1995 doe made the difficult decision to eliminate funding for algae research within the biofuels program this report is a summary and compilation of all the work done over the last 16 years of the program
928820 when the time is right we fully expect to see renewed interest in algae as a source of fuels and other chemicals the highlights presented here should serve as a foundation for these future efforts
928821 its a game changing technology and will transform the way we think about biofuels on a broad scale
928822 this technology could change the rate at which these feedstocks could be brought into the marketplace
928823 the satellite was only launched in 2002 and it enabled the collection of data not just on temperature but also on cloud formation and water vapour what all the climate models suggest is that when youve got warming from additional carbon dioxide this will result in increased water vapour so youre going to get a positive feedback thats what the models have been indicating what this great data from the nasa aqua satellite and the first time this data has been able to be collected is 2002 so weve got a little bit of data now its actually showing just the opposite that with a little bit of warming weather processes are compensating so theyre actually limiting the greenhouse effect and youre actually getting a negative rather than a positive feedback
928824 when they were first deployed in 2003 the argos were hailed for their ability to collect information on ocean conditions more precisely at more places and greater depths and in more conditions than ever before no longer would scientists have to rely on measurements mostly at the surface from older scientific buoys or inconsistent shipboard monitors so why are some scientists now beginning to question the buoys findings because in five years the little blighters have failed to detect any global warming they are not reinforcing the scientific orthodoxy of the day namely that man is causing the planet to warm dangerously they are not proving the predetermined conclusions of their human masters therefore they and not their masters hypotheses must be wrong
928825 it global warming has stopped for the last ten years but thats a very short timeframe if you look over the last 100 years its mostly been warming over the last 100 years but there was some cooling from 1940 through to 1975 and now there appears to be some cooling since 1998 but if you look at the longer timeframe say since the last glacial maximum well thats going back say 16 000 years then there actually has been significant warming and sea levels of course have risen over 100 metres over this period so the last eight to ten year dip may just be a dip and there may be continued warming into the future or it could be the end of this interglacial wa rm period and we could go into another ice age we dont know what the future holds
928826 a physicist on another blog assured me that the ocean buoy data was caused by melting sea ice like ice cubes melting in a glass cause the drink to cool
928827 a better world could be better post peak oil if we plan and work together
928828 i for one see evidence of global warming all around me let people be skeptical about global warming if it pleases them
928829 you cant point to a local phenomena to prove your case it is the world wide picture you must mind
928830 as an engineer i have a real problem with the sky is falling type prediction made by some scientist
928831 if a full battery pack of 70ah batteries is used the bus has a range of 31 miles on battery only
928832 turbines have very high angular momentum and resist turning when considering the coefficient of friction of pov tires on wet pavement this is not a very desirable handling characteristic
928833 us doe just released their 20 wind energy in 2030 and predicts that wind could supply 20 percent of us electricity needs by 2030
928834 do any of these wind plants have an impact on bird life are they out far enough that it wont be killing birds at a high rate or is that even a problem i read somewhere that this is a problem with wind generators anybody have any stats or solutions on this
928835 how secure would these facilities be i suspect there is a need for a significant maintenance effort to protect monitor the space around these windmills
928836 it might easily cost twice as much to build a nuclear plant in the uk if you could build it at all there are also much greater uncertainty risks in a 10 year project than a 24 month project the uk will need the power long before nukes could be completed and off shore wind is going to be cheaper than blackouts
928837 virent has proven that sugars can be converted into the same hydrocarbon mixtures of todays gasoline blends
928838 the companies next step would be two years of further testing followed by the possible construction of a demonstration conversion plant about one quarter of the size of a full scale commercial plant
928839 we believe this technology has the potential to be cost competitive otherwise we wouldnt be taking this route
928840 farmers are going to do well in the coming decades
928841 this is how many people there are in this world this is how much land we need to be able to feed them all this is how much land is available for biofuels etc
928842 virents pilot plants are currently able to produce only a gallon of biogasoline a day its engineers hope to demonstrate a commercial size plant able to produce around 10 000 liters within the next few years
928843 cant do cant do cant do cant do human nature wont allow it history has proven that it is impossible i can spend endless hours researching alternate energy technology on the web but i cannot spend five minutes thinking about the social and economic reform required to eliminate our dependence on growth because i know in advance that it wont work
928844 the th nk city is the worlds only crash tested and highway certified electric vehicle and is ideal for markets such as california where we will initiate demonstration projects offering an exceptionally safe and fun car to drive
928845 we believe there is a dramatic shift underway of how people think about mobility global consumer demand is forcing the industry to come up with sustainable solutions including the development of zero emission vehicles
928846 the real question is if one can set up solar panels on ones house and get enough energy out for both a car and basic home needs youd probably want the high efficiency panels which are the most expensive
928847 first if we developed no green energy but relied mainly on coal we would most likely get a net decrease in pollutants and we would stop the cash bleed out of our economy
928848 fast powerful car is needed to show you are better than the other guy
928849 fact we ship box cars of money out of the country to maintain our petroleum supply
928850 the possibility exists for a co2 free energy system based on fossil fuels
928851 interesting to see a new investment in thin silicon solar i wonder if dupont and others will start feeling squeezed by nanosolar on price per watt or whether they can be competitive
928852 solar capacity will be exploding over the next decade as a result of federal and state incentives a world class resource in the southwest and significant technology advances utilities signed power purchase contracts for 2 339 mw of new solar capacity in 2006 and 2007 with project completion dates between 2006 and 2014 more contracts are expected to be signed in the first half of this year there are more than 80 utility scale solar plants being pursued in the united states the western governors association projects a potential market in the west of nearly 10 000 mw by 2015 and a long term potential of nearly 200 000 mw

928854 if you compare literacy health life expectancy by ethnic groupings and ses the us does quite well in other words americans of european descent compare well to europeans americans of african descent compare well to africans etc etc by forgetting the multi ethnic nature of the us and comparing it to other places that are much more homogeneous ethnically one commits a common error made by comparing apples and oranges science has long known that ethnic groupings are divergent in several areas medical doctors have to understand that teachers should know it public policy analysts and policy makers should also understand it
928855 small scale nuclear makes a lot of sense to me for city scale baseload power
928856 the greenpower bio oil project is a prime example of thenergos multifuel approach to the production of sustainable energy our strategy to diversify our feedstock base namely biogas natural gas bio oil woody biomass and secondary fuels ensures long term procurement security better management of fuel costs while allowing us to be more reactive to market driven opportunities
928857 biomass and bio energy are modest basically simple technologies that can provide regional and local solutions to many problems that sounds too optimistic we have to attack it before that optimistic attitude sets in
928858 so i was already beginning to move toward environmental activism
928859 and then i saw an inconvenient truth at the music hall
928860 as my husband and i walked home we said we knew we had to change our lives
928861 i could not believe id been intellectualizing the problem for so long i knew i had to do something
928862 because in 20 years our house could be under water but i said we have to stay and work here for me i knew right away it was going to take the form of activism
928863 this was an important step for me on my environmental journey
928864 andrew is not ideologically an environmentalist but he had a product that was sustainable
928865 the advocacy i had been doing was important but i was really tired of preaching to the choir
928866 i kept asking myself how i could reach people who dont identify as environmentalists
928867 it may be summertime in maine but winter is on the mind of many maine people
928868 it is time we begin working together to do what we can before the temperature drops
928869 i know we are in serious trouble this winter especially for the elderly
928870 we have to do something to help these people out
928871 the best part is seeing them all together again playing and having a good time
928872 when i started selling puppies i told each of the owners i would like to check back in and throw a little reunion
928873 i thought it sounded unusual but also a lot of fun
928874 we just wanted to see what the rest of the pups looked like its great that we can all keep in touch

928882 o esporte continua em uma evolu o surpreendente e os clubes procuram tirar a maior vantagem poss vel eles investem muito e t m esse direito
928883 o presidente lula estar em pequim durante dois dias tendo contatos com diversas pessoas para mostrar que a candidatura do rio forte vi vel e que poderemos fazer uma edi o hist rica dos jogos
928884 what has been the shift in wealth caused by the latest economic situation huge no need for leftist dems to drive more tax increase for higher income and the very wealthy to punish the rich for their success
928885 obama cant do it because then it would be obama lama
928886 so what was happening then which is not happening now
928887 part 2 explores the factual basis for barack obamas dual citizenship and concludes that he has been a citizen of at least two countries and therefore is ineligible to be president there is clear prima facie evidence that senator barack hussein obama has held at least two citizenships american and indonesian under article ii of the constitution that disqualifies him for potus and it should he may also have held other nationalities how many it is not clear he isnt eligible unless and until the supreme court rules on dual nationality or the congress passes statute law and the constitution is amended
928888 in reality there are just two types of voters the romantic democrats and the common sense democrats
928889 and it came to pass in the eighth year of the reign of the evil bush the younger the ignorant when the whole land from the arabian desert to the shores of the great lakes had been laid barren that a child appeared in the wilderness
928890 after the vote bartoshevich again said she planned to vote for mccain in november and that she was dropping out of the democratic party
928891 i dont believe senator obama has the experience to run this country
928892 would rather lose the war to win a political campaign
928893 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
928894 remember back in may when media gushed and fawned over a huge crowd in portland oregon supposedly gathered to hear the words of democrat presidential candidate barack obama but chose not to report the free concert given before his speech well it has been learned that before the presumptive democrat nominee spoke to a crowd in berlin thursday two popular german acts reggae artist patrice and rock band reamonn entertained the gathering audience
928895 coincidence or co ordination guess it depends on the eyes of the beholder
928896 im glad elizabeth edwards probably doesnt have to shop for food because the thought of her seeing it is grotesque
928897 likely nominee to be the next executive director of the united nations childrens fund unicef
928898 veneman is expected to get the job because of the defining role that the bush administration plays in the selection process just as u s pressure set up wolfowitz for the world bank position
928899 the notion that veneman would be placed in a position to decide how to feed and care for the planets most destitute children is every bit as alarming as the notion that wolfowitz would be charged with providing aid to developing countries
928900 indeed as ravi narayan coordinator for the global secretariat of the peoples health movement wrote in a letter to un secretary general kofi annan and the members of the executive board of unicef ms
928901 indeed her performance in these positions has been characterized by the elevation of corporate profit above peoples right to food u
928902 just as it is vital for responsible americans to object to the selection of paul wolfowitz to serve as president of the world bank so it is equally vital that we object to the selection of ann veneman to lead unicef
928903 allowed me to send a message to the american people that the judgments i have made and the judgments i will make are ones that are going to result in them being safer
928904 but just coming here to find every conspiracy theory article regarding barack obama and posting them hoping some will stick seems pretty counterproductive
928905 gordo is an acquired taste and i now consider myself an aficionado
928906 a president has to be able to both clearly understand and also shape the context in which he addresses the american people presidential words are effective when they resonate with the countrys political realities whether the media perceive them or not and when a chief executive has the skills to alter the context to fit the words the degree to which obama has these other skills required of a president remains unknown
928907 what a welcome change it would be were presidential candidates in our time to treat each other and the people they seek to lead with respect and courtesy as they discussed the great issues of the day
928908 the american public deserves to know when someone is trying to persuade them
928909 in 1980 she worked on the national staff of the citizens party trying to elect barry commoner president as a vehicle for starting a third party in the us
928910 that our next president could actually end up being a person of intelligence
928911 for barack and michelle obama the biggest blind spot is ego tripping the temptations of boastful grandiosity
928912 only after striking out in trying to grab the brandenburg gate to cast himself in the same light as john f kennedy and ronald reagan did he settle for a speech at the a prussian battle monument relocated by hitler
928913 the dalai lama praised mccain for his concern while emphasizing he wasnt endorsing mccains presidential bid
928914 barack obama made an effort to defuse the flap surrounding a canceled visit to a u s military hospital during his overseas trip but john mccains campaign isnt about to let the matter rest
928915 well no not at all it was scheduled we intended to go and we got wind that there was some concern that this might be perceived as political because we were using campaign resources and at that point the last thing i wanted to do is to in any way distract the terrific work thats being done in terms of treating our troops by getting it fouled up by a bunch of politics i didnt want it to be a distraction
928916 the one thing hes done with the aid of cable television and talk radio is dumb down the country much like brians influence over this blog
928917 im just realizing what ive got to become accustomed to the fact that i was played like that at the gym do you remember the color of money with paul newman and forest whitaker is sort of sitting there acting like he doesnt know how to play pool and then he hustles the hustler she hustled us we walk into the gym shes already on the treadmill she looks like just an ordinary german girl she smiles and sort of waves shyly but doesnt go out of her way to say anything as im walking out she says oh can i have a picture im a big fan reggie takes the picture
928918 i am surrounded by woods amp animal life amp everything gets eaten before harvesting

928926 once again the republicans are trying to get gay marriage on a bunch of state ballots to get out the evangelical vote but i dont think it will work this time
928927 false choices are great rhetorical tricks for junior high debate teams
928928 the media people should make clear what is going on among the politicians among the religious leaders among the business leaders among the scientists doctors every field the media must inform to build healthy leadership and a healthy society in totalitarian society that is lacking the media should be truthful unbiased honest

928930 im going to want somebody with independence whos willing to tell me where he thinks or she thinks im wrong
928931 no matter how many of these events michelle does it will never equal the statement obama himself made when he snubbed chicagos gay pride parade on june 29th 2008 and instead got a haircut and played basketball followed by a luxurious steam at the east bank club that act told us all we needed to know about obamas real support for the lgbt community but if you want another great breakdown on how badly obama has always treated the lgbt community check this out and also remember sam nunn one of the most bigoted and homophobic democratic senators of the past 30 years remains at the top of obamas vp short list the man who fired two gay staffers in the 80s who publicly embarrassed himself and the lgbt community by parading in a submarines shower room to rail against gay sailors in the 90s who concluded his senate career by casting the deciding vote to kill federal anti discrimination legislation when he faced no political backlash or recrimination from doing the just and moral thing to mandate equality for lgbt government employees and their families
928932 quote of the week rbo thinks cqpolitics craig crawford absolutely blows all other analyses of obamas berlin speech straight out of the tierpark
928933 obama has promised a raised minimum wage pegged to rise with inflation that hit a near three year high of 1 1 percent in june together with family tax breaks and increased access to affordable housing

928942 today eating out is as common as eating at home
928943 standing with slobodan milosevic on the veranda of a government hunting lodge outside belgrade i saw two men in the distance they got out of their twin mercedeses and in the fading light started toward us i felt a jolt go through my body they were unmistakable ratko mladic in combat fatigues stocky walking as though through a muddy field and radovan karadzic taller wearing a suit with his wild but carefully coiffed shock of white hair
928944 halfway around the world the obama campaign machine appears as sprawling and seamless as it is on its home turf as the presumptive democratic nominee tours five countries in five days he brings an entourage that would make a pop star envious
928945 oh yeah the anbar awakening was the real reason iraq is improving
928946 you know if his campaign had any smarts they would get supporters out there to greet mccain but apparently they havent thought of that yet

928950 don fowler the former head of the dnc sent a letter to democratic leaders and major contributors this week urging party unity
928951 perhaps barack obama has become desensitized to such expressions of prejudice and hatred
928952 nobody has spoken out more fiercely on the issue of anti semitism than i have
928953 that connection with gluten and dairy and autism is spooky i would hope that is being pursued
928954 the enquirer has been running all kinds of stories on obama

928967 will say that i disagree we live in a theocracy its a plutocracy the neo cons just manipulate the religious right to maintain their power
928968 if we forgot or didnt think of anything or something comes up that we didnt know about that right belongs to the people unless they specifically amend this constitution
928969 obamas efforts to catapult himself into the universe of iconic figures took an especially creepy turn today with this poster which is advertising his speech before a war monument the siegessaule venerated by the nazis give the dude some blond hair and blue eyes and were talking a candidate for the nazi youth the last guy in germany with this kind of cult of personality had a catchier phrase one people one nation one leader but lacked the flash in graphics
928970 the states would not ratify the constitution until they got the bill of rights
928971 superclass the global power elite and the world they are making
928972 inside the network of business government military and cultural elites who are redefining power in the global era
928973 i cannot profess to understand what techniques will be taught at
928974 the only person obama would acknowledge is on his short list of running mates includes senator hillary rodham clinton
928975 and she got elbowed out of the way by the chicago mob
928976 ve had quite enough of republicans in any position of authority above postal clerk
928977 read something about a soldier about to be executed approved by the bush
928978 unlike in the civilian courts a member of the u s armed forces cannot be executed until the president approves the death sentence gray has been on death row at the u s disciplinary barracks at fort leavenworth kan since april 1988
928979 i know that barack obama is a near perfect political package im still not sure though whats in it
928980 i still want to see mc rove and company do their impression of the frogmarch
928981 rangel who has a net worth of between 566 000 and 1 2 million according to his congressional disclosure filings paid a total of 3 894 a month in rent in 2007 for the four apartments the times reports and hes using one as a campaign office even though state and city regulations require rent stabilized apartments to be used as primary residences

928985 i want them to feel that they are somebody and their congressman is somebody
928986 and when they say this is nice it feels good
928987 mccains mean ass side is showing by trying to take political advantage of the situation and is using the wounded troops in a kind of sneaky ass inverse way
928988 is it easier than recognizing the awful campaign gore ran
928989 just think if we were leaders in alternative fuel vehicles and the whole world purchased american made cars
928990 and do you really think your voting for anyone other than mccain will swing sc out of the mccain column
928991 his campaign might want to try to dampen some of this down before it hits the obamazombie level
928992 there is now a growing body of evidence suggesting that barack obama has held and perhaps still holds citizenship in multiple countries dual citizenship raises troubling questions under the constitution about the conflicting allegiances a potus and commander in chief could possess a conflict that the founding fathers envisioned and sought to prevent a two part series by judah benjamin challenging the constitutionality of obamas bid for the presidency based on the dual citizenship problem
928993 the berlin speech appears to have bothered some a great deal i didnt like him acting as though he was already the president but im a little surprised to hear others say it even more forcefully
928994 im actually for dropping the federal gas taxes if they can come up with some way to make up the difference for transportation read mass transit infrastructure
928995 gas taxes are down and they might have to borrow from the mass transportation fund so eliminating the gas tax money might not as brian says be a good idea
928996 this week i am quite disillusioned by the veep discussion coming out of obama hq truly hillary has worked as hard or even more for the nomination and i think real unity would suggest at least offering her the position
928997 in making their case the rand authors assert that american efforts since the sept 11 attacks have been a mixed bag they bottom line it this way in laymans terms
928998 the good news about countering al qaeda is that its probability of success in actually overthrowing any governments is close to zero
928999 the bad news is that u s efforts against al qaeda have not been successful
929000 as evidence the study notes that the number of al qaeda attacks worldwide excluding iraq and afghanistan had increased after 9 11 and spiked last year to nearly double the previous high
929001 when it becomes more profitable to make something here than it does to ship something from thousands of miles away then manufacturing will come home
929002 we are disgusted with the party we have long trusted to represent our interests we are disgusted with ourselves for being snookered again
929003 tell us that obl and aq had been rendered weak and ineffective by the conflated iraq war and war on terror
929004 the larger issue is important if we are angry at the obama campaign do we stay angry to the point of letting the repugs retain the white house i cant think of an uglier scenario this week i am quite disillusioned by the veep discussion coming out of obama hq truly hillary has worked as hard or even more for the nomination and i think real unity would suggest at least offering her the position i am down tom
929005 size and scope of the attacks have been greatly diminished
929006 the day that as a democrat i am not allowed to question our partys
929007 the ones being hurt most are those living on the margin of the poverty line with higher prices at the grocery store and the gas station posted by jamie july 29 2008 12 29 pm
929008 the day that as a democrat i am not allowed to question our partys candidate is the day our party is doomed dont forget that when you read brian ub and dog
929009 i have never told anyone what to think nor have i told anyone on this or any blog how to interpret other peoples posts
929010 the problem with them trying to interfere when youre typing on your laptop is that they often catch the keys with their claws i have the laptop to prove it and getting a new keyboard aint cheap but theyre worth it
929011 oh brian get real other than gordos non stop conspiracy fountain you have heard less here than you might on the evening news and it is usually mixed with lots of praise bitches witches and shrews oh my pathetic sore losers gee whiz chloe those storms you describe sound really ominous but i imagine you get used to them i think of moving from california but i dont know where id like to live other than here im close to the beach the mountains the desert but its so expensive to live in california i can understand why you left because the economy here isnt very good anymore for the chloe ill miss everyone well almost here too but ill be back ive been doing this fair for 17 yrs the third time while on this blog im still here hey there peps can i fly with you or is this a private coven july 29 2008 gallup daily obama 47 mccain 41 obamas surge appears to have peaked princeton nj barack obamas lead over john mccain having reached a nine percentage point margin a few days ago has been reduced for the second gallup report in a row and is now at a 6 point 47 to 41 margin among registered voters in gallup poll daily tracking conducted july 26 28
929012 and it keeps the cost down which benefits us the buyer
929013 there is nothing thats off the table i dont want tax increases but that doesnt mean that anything is off the table
929014 i admit i am a political novice i admit i dont know black people and you take my honesty and turn it into an insult
929015 then stop trying to gain some sort of cosmic superiority
929016 the hauntingly menacing journalist robert novack who outed valarie plame has a brain tumor and wont be writing for the washington post anymore
929017 a daily capsule of rember as the drug is known stops alzheimers disease progressing by as much as 81 per cent those taking rember did not experience any significant decline in their mental function over 19 months
929018 axis of evil world tour an americans travels in iran iraq and north korea
929019 president in waiting barack obama now aspires to be the leader of earth itself
929020 they seem to love having the cohesiveness that overarching rhetoric performed in magnificent spaces generates
929021 but he has grown accustomed to putting on this sort of saccharine show for the rock concert masses and in berlin his act jumped the shark
929022 what is it thats wrong about a leader who is intelligent articulate and inspirational
929023 the golden rhetoric impresses less the evasion of hard choices strikes one more
929024 perhaps americans are so desperate to be liked by the rest of the world that obama is on to something
929025 my posts are for those who treat me with respect only
929026 firstly craig its not that americans are so desperate to be liked as much as it is that the rest of the world longs for america the world leader to reflect the morality and hope that it used to possess before it went bush league secondly to all the nay sayers tell me again what is it thats wrong about a leader who is intelligent articulate and inspirational
929027 clintonites still arent sending much cash to obama why thats good news for the dems
929028 what is there in his past performance in the offices he has held that we can use to predict his future performance
929029 curious as to the spin the bho organization gave to each of the press to make sure a consistent theme is portrayed
929030 obamas speech in berlin was an ad for the war on terror he conjured up the spirit of the berlin airlift and used it to call for german solidarity it is now finally clear to the german government that more involvement and particularly in afghanistan will be expected from berlin the us doesnt see why they should grind away at fighting the taliban while the germans play the nice reconstruction aid workers obama will ask for more hell ask the germans to deploy troops in the dangerous south
929031 althought this has long been clear to the german government obama was still treated like a teddy bear politicians from almost every party projected the feeling that the trans atlantic partnership would automatically blossom with the democratic politician as president
929032 while the government already knows what awaits it the voters for the parties in berlins grand coalition could soon experience a rude awakening once they see that obamas new america is pursuing the same old goals until now the germans have always been able to reject a more robust mandate for afghanistan with the unspoken knowledge that there was no need to run after someone like george w bush but it will be much tougher to reject any urgent requests from a president obama who has just been so widely celebrated here
929033 you didnt need to know everything you just needed to know where to find everything
929034 does the education of women have any effect on birth rate and population control
929035 cell phones for soldiers cell phone recycling program on it it says help our troops call home
929036 experience is a great teacher but not the only one and not a reliable indicator of how an individual will fare once in the arena and faced with decision making
929037 karo i have begged you to stop throwing your racist family in the mix we dont care what sort of upbringing you had
929038 will be called upon to play a greater role in the war on terror and that means contributing more troops to the war in afghanistan
929039 youve heard the talk on television from other se ohio people wv and ky its not about me or my family its an ethnic thing bigotry rules the area its a matter of fact
929040 i thought it was great to hear obama talking about shared responsibility as he said we formed nato to fight communism certainly we can do the same to fight terrorism
929041 the press certainly helped obama get so far so fast the question is how far can he get if his campaign alienates them
929042 so much for obama love mccains web ad this romance has been a prominent story line of obamas entire campaign amp clearly elements of it are true
929043 it seems like mccain can sit there and not be doing much of anything and things stay pretty much the same weird
929044 an obama hillary clinton ticket would eat a mccain mitt romney ticket by 48 percent to 39 percent
929045 reporters who have covered obamas biography or his problems with certain voter blocs have been challenged the most aggressively
929046 the whole obama narrative is built around this narrative that obama and david axelrod built and like all stories its not entirely true so they have to be protective of the crown jewels
929047 wonder why obama is hidding plenty of damaging info dems who want to win the wh should demand answers from obama now this is the calm before the storm the repubs would be ferocious in their attack on him

929050 on friday the german press sifts through the text and subtext of obamas speech
929051 its seems that much of the republican complaints about obamas coverage or this trip is tinged in jealousy in the fact that their candidate doesnt engender the same energy or positive vibrations
929052 how ridiculous is it that mccain goes to a sausage house while obama is in germany
929053 say what you will about obama at least hes working his ass of to get it
929054 couric and i really dont mean to belabor this senator because im really im trying to figure out your position do you think the level of security in iraq would exist today without the surge
929055 obama katie i have no idea what would have happened had we applied my approach which was to put more pressure on the iraqis to arrive at a political reconciliation so this is all hypotheticals what i can say is that theres no doubt that our u s troops have contributed to a reduction of violence in iraq i said that not just today not just yesterday but ive said that previously what that doesnt change is that weve got to have a different strategic approach if were going to make america as safe as possible
929056 i doubt there would be any complaints were it john mccain in front of 200 000 germans giving the same speech
929057 collect pictures and build a shrine but dont expect the rest of us to worship at the altar
929058 dont you have a feeling that the people behind mccain have just stopped trying
929059 its a copy of rise and fall of the third reich

929061 senator obama are you now or have you ever been a member of the nazi party
929062 hey is obamas campaign footing the entire bill or are the american taxpayers on the hook for this trip just asking
929063 of course we love america you guys saved us twice
929064 fresh polls show that he has been unable to convert weeks of extensive media coverage into a widened lead and some prominent democrats whose support could boost his campaign are still not enthusiastic about his candidacy several new surveys show that obama is in a tight race or even losing ground to republican john mccain both nationally and in two important swing states colorado and minnesota one new poll offered a possible explanation for his troubles a minority of voters see obama as a familiar figure with whom they can identify obama also faces discontent from some of hillary rodham clintons most ardent supporters who are put off by what they describe as a campaign marked by hubris and a style dedicated to televised extravaganzas
929065 i hold my nose to vote for obama as i disparage him in the same comment

929069 obama web site has a wealth of information on it regarding issues
929070 article ii of the constitution of the united states does not mean what almost everybody thinks that it means it isnt talking about where the potus is born no the framers were talking about allegiance loyalty the potus had to have only one allegiance there is no way a person who has dual citizenship or who has had dual citizenship should be eligible under article ii as you will see in part two there is good evidence that senator barack obama is such a person that governor bill richardson may also be and that senator john mccain is not by definition natural born born in the sole allegiance of the usa not born on us soil the whole first part of this article cites case law sources precedent and gives the opinion of lawyers the chief counsel for the ins has said that this argument is valid he doesnt like it but he admits it is true

929077 dont lie pissed the pentagon asked him not to visit the troops in germany because they felt it was not appropriate since he was on the political leg of his trip
929078 we made it clear to him that campaign staff amp press would not be permitted to accompany him we relayed those ground rules they made a choice based upon the information we relayed to them it was obamas choice
929079 putting money where mouths are media donations favor dems 100 1
929080 true to form journalists are defending their bias by saying that one candidate obama is more newsworthy than the other it is we the hoi polloi who reveal our bias by questioning the neutrality of these learned professionals in their ivory towered newsrooms
929081 john mccain has been forced to play the pip squeak all week the candidate has been trying to get one word in edgewise while barack obama has been swarmed by adoring officials and supporters overseas even when the mccain camp tried to drum up media criticism around obama canceling a visit to us troops in germany they were silenced and made to look like the ones who had gaffed they criticized obama for canceling the trip only to be told later that it was in fact a long standing pentagon policy that had forced the cancellation

929107 the poll of likely minnesota voters conducted by quinnipiac university has obama up 46 to 44 its within the surveys margin of sampling error meaning the race is considered about even last month the same pollsters put obama 17 percentage points ahead of mccain
929108 obamas approval rating with registered latino voters the nationwide pew hispanic center poll found is at 66 percent versus 23 percent favoring mccain
929109 again like the bar application i understand that the state department takes these investigations quite seriously and requires full and honest disclosure and urges applicants to err on the side of disclosure did obama complete high level professional applications truthfully and fully disclose all potentially relevant information about his past would obama qualify for a top secret security clearance today if he were an average applicant given his background
929110 the poll of likely minnesota voters conducted by quinnipiac university has obama up 46 to 44 its within the surveys margin of sampling error meaning the race is considered about even last month the same pollsters put obama 17 percentage points ahead of mccain

929143 the current gold standard membrane is a polymer that needs to be in a humid environment in order to function efficiently
929144 the efficiency of current membranes drops significantly at temperatures over 190 degrees fahrenheit however the chemical reactions that create the electricity are more efficient at high temperatures so it would be a big improvement for fuel cell technology to make this advance
929145 ultimately by 2020 we figure that 80 percent of vehicles are going to require some sort of level of hybridization we cannot get to 35 miles per gallon with anything resembling the current product portfolio with conventional technology

929153 people think somethings good or valuable and its not you see such a huge variety of things like late victorian paintings that were massed produced maybe theyre of no value
929154 they tell people to act excited on the show but once i had a lady who brought in a painting and i found a similar painting in an art record i told her it was worth 45 000 and she just said well thats nice she wasnt all that excited

929165 r esearch shows that one out of every six women of childbearing age in the united states may have blood mercury concentrations high enough to damage a developing fetus this means that 630 000 of the 4 million babies born in the country each year are at risk of neurological damage because of exposure to dangerous mercury levels in the womb
929166 in the united states 23 600 deaths each year can be attributed to air pollution from power plants those dying prematurely due to exposure to particulate matter lose on average 14 years of life burning coal also is responsible for some 554 000 asthma attacks 16 200 cases of chronic bronchitis and 38 200 non fatal heart attacks each year atmospheric power plant pollution in the united states racks up an estimated annual health care bill of over 160 billion
929167 see i can make a nice long post without calling anyone a nasty name
929168 r esearch shows that one out of every six women of childbearing age in the united states may have blood mercury concentrations high enough to damage a developing fetus this means that 630 000 of the 4 million babies born in the country each year are at risk of neurological damage because of exposure to dangerous mercury levels in the womb
929169 but im not satisfied with stopping where we are when we can do better
929170 in 8 years nearly all perus glaciers will be gone due to global warming and its 27 million people will nearly all lack fresh water with the likely result being chaos conflict and mass migration
929171 a total of 46 nations and 2 7 billion people are now at high risk of being overwhelmed by armed conflict and war because of climate change
929172 what we do in the next two to three years will determine our future this is the defining moment
929173 we have thought through many complex issues around sustainable transportation and our confidence in the future of hydrogen remains high
929174 expressed doubts about the viability of hydrogen fuel cells for mass market production in the
929175 they came to the same bottom line hydrogen will likely fuel the cars of the future although it could take
929176 deploying an unworkable technology is great for the tech purveyors but very bad for policy and the public hydrogen is nothing but an energy medium and pushing hydrogen vehicles does nothing to either provide more energy or make better use of what weve got
929177 the theoretical maximum efficiency that is achievable by fuel cell is 69
929178 we believe we have the most economical way to produce biofuels from cellulosic material
929179 the real question is how best to utilize a limited resource i doubt ethanol is the most effect use
929180 municipal sludges are the natural end products of a microbial food chain in the wastewater treatment process microbes feed on organic components of waste until they can no longer derive energy from it at this point sludge consists of mostly cellular material and stable degradation products that are considered safe for application to agricultural or forest lands if properly managed land application is an excellent way to dispose of sludge waste can be applied at rates to meet crop nutrient requirements without harming the environment both the waste generator and the crop producer benefit from this recycling system humans and animals are natural waste generators and land application makes it possible to recover the valuable components of waste as a usable resource

929183 believes that the development and deployment of advanced nuclear reactors based on fast neutron fission technology is important to the sustainability reliability and security of the worlds long term energy supply
929184 extending by a hundred fold the amount of energy extracted from the same amount of mined uranium
929185 virtually all long lived heavy elements are eliminated during fast reactor operation leaving a small amount of fission product waste which requires assured isolation from the environment for less than 500 years

929187 our mission is to invest in the most vulnerable in our community we realise the desperate need for accommodation for these young men and women at risk at long last we are glad we can offer quality en suite accommodation for both young men and women
929188 we wish to make it quite clear that this delay will not in any way affect the current delivery of services to over 80 young people currently receiving support 24 7 at our st giles premises it does however mean that our second site of 40 new move on units will have to sit on the drawing board a little longer than we had anticipated
929189 we still need to raise around 800 000 to complete the second phase and we are appealing to local people and businesses to help us reach our final target said john

929195 energy storage is key to expanding the use of renewable energy this technology has the potential to reduce the impact caused by the variability and limited predictability of wind energy generation
929196 commercial projects are now underway that use compressed air energy storage
929197 i dont think stored energy is that important solar wind can supplement the existing grid nukes and coal plants and gas fired plants can ramp up in those odd situations where demand peaks but supply is limited

929202 in this case we were struck by the fact that carol pugh of greenland has a history of abusing animals and we think its particularly important that animals be shielded from that
929203 law enforcement gets discretion and its entirely their decision but given the history i hope the judge will decide the dog should be confiscated
929204 if shes found guilty i strongly urge the judge to not allow her to own any more animals
929205 seventy percent of animal abusers commit other crimes from murder to trafficking in drugs and firearms offenses in 1986 only four states had felony animal abuse laws today there are only five that dont arkansas mississippi idaho north dakota and south dakota we hope to have that remedied in the 2009 legislative session
929206 a prosecutor might think the burden of proof is too high to meet a felony charge or there could be other mitigating circumstances

929213 the nuclear industry supply chain in america is mostly non functioning the canadians still have some know how with their candu reactors and could build a few but the americans havent built nuclear reactors for a long time and are facing a baby boom retirement
929214 see what germany is doing using integrated biogas solar and wind power systems
929215 we expect polysilicon supply to catch up with the demand already in 2008
929216 the majority of the new quantities will be supplied to the market by top 4 producers that are expanding their existing production capacities
929217 comparison of capacity factors reveal that nuclear power plants produce 3 to 5 times as much power per equivalent nameplate rated capacity as solar installations do
929218 the net result is the dieoff of solar equipment because it does not work and apparently no one cares
929219 ender you appear to have little concept of the orgization of energy generation nucks are run at fule power not because it is impossible to run them at lower rates but the produce power at lower costs than other energy sources
929220 the problem is not with nuks but with renewables that produce power in erratic unpredictable fashion
929221 renewables with the possible exception of st power are unreliable you need more reliable sources of power than renewables to keep power systems going
929222 the cost of nuclear generated electricity fell by 7 from 1998 to 2001 and is now about eur 3 cents kwh which is very competitive in europe the back end costs reprocessing wastes disposal etc are fairly small when compared to the total kwh cost typically about 5
929223 as far as i know theres no problem with that why would this need a

929259 unlike kate and gerry i was only trying to report a burglary not the theft of my child
929260 one of the things obvious to anyone dealing with the police on the algarve is the sorry fact that no matter what you have lost there simply isnt enough of them to begin tracking it down
929261 that may be one of the worst twists of fate in what happened to madeleine that tragically she went missing in the wrong place
929262 investing in our employees through the delivery of well structured and tailored training we can realise a truly skilled workforce that will improve productivity raise skills standards and improve the quality of customer service
929263 everyone reaps the benefits employees companies and ultimately the wider economy
929264 i urge all employers both large and small to really make it their business this year to find out more about apprenticeships and how they can help their business grow as well as raise the skills level of the northern ireland workforce
929265 these road deaths are terrible tragedies for the families and friends of those killed and my thoughts are with them at this time
929266 so far this year 65 people have died as a result of road traffic collisions 17 during the month of july alone these are not just numbers these are peoples lives
929267 it is particularly disappointing compared with last year when the total number killed at this time sat at 63
929268 remember alcohol and speed remain two of the main causes of fatal and serious injury collisions in northern ireland
929269 i would urge everyone to make sure that the remainder of the summer holiday period is one we remember for fun and enjoyment and not for death and injury on our roads
929270 remember never ever drink and drive slow down pay attention and always wear your seat belt
929271 it is a big day because there has been a lot of national speculation about the whereabouts and restart to ben cousins football career
929272 and we are going to be giving ben that opportunity along with east fremantle football club to restart and see if he can get back to afl football
929273 i sat down with ben yesterday and discussed what his aims and aspirations are for taking this next step are and he was really positive about being involved as a member of our football club
929274 he has obviously been ticking all the boxes from a medical point of view and he is from a physical point of view training very hard to keep himself in the sort of condition that would allow him to train from the outset
929275 my understanding is ben wishes to train with us mondays tuesdays and thursdays and that he will have some involvement with east fremantle in some capacity with their colts programme
929276 there are a few reasons behind it we have looked at a few parts of the scenario it is a great opportunity for our playing list to have the opportunity to train with arguably one of the champions of the modern game
929277 and what he has to offer as a player in the way in he trains and prepares himself to be an afl footballer
929278 ben has had an association with out football club through his father bryan who was a past great and our football family would like to stick together and offer our support to the cousins family
929279 the key point ben made was that he really wanted to make sure he committed to our senior training program and that when we have training he will be here
929280 regardless of the situation i see it a positive for our playing list to be rubbing shoulders with a player of his ilk and what he brings in terms of that intensity could be the remedy we need to shake these boys up after a poor month of performances

929299 estem decebuts no es produeix un canvi que era el que vol em i pel que ens vam presentar a les eleccions
929300 amb el pam que avui sanuncia es fa una aposta pel mateix model perqu res canvi en la manera de fer i governar barcelona
929301 qu passar amb el t nel del tgv pel centre de la ciutat i amb la muntanya russa els acords es faran complir o sobviaran
929302 seguim necessitant un canvi de model de lideratge de manera de fer i entendre la ciutat
929303 seguirem intentant trobar camins de col laboraci amb erc intentarem fer los entendre que aquesta manera daprovar el pam no s la adient per produir un canvi a la ciutat el canvi es produir per altres raons amb unes eleccions si capgirem la situaci dient quines s n les coses que cal canviar i no intentant tapar forats que s el que passa avui amb laprovaci del pam per anar aguantant
929304 avui no sabem quins s n els punts que shan canviat per arribar a lacord amb el pla dactuaci el que denota una manera poc transparent de funcionar

929307 this study is one step towards a greater insight into the relationship between oily substances and water at the molecular level an area of fundamental science which is relatively little understood but which has enormous potential for industry medicine and nanotechnology
929308 it was very interesting to see that our results suggest there is no tiny gap between oil and water when they meet despite having a reputation for not liking each other it seems the opposite is true they may not be able to mix but they come into full contact with each other at a strong interface perhaps they like each other more than we previously thought

929347 as a gaming company fraud is far more than a chargeback it is any unwanted activity that threatens our bottom line and impacts the integrity of the environment of our loyal players
929348 paf has been building a powerful internal fraud team to tackle these activities and we see ethoca as the perfect partner to keep chip dumping at bay
929349 most fraud management practices involve a one step decision making process that evaluates the companys own experiences but this should be a two step process that incorporates the payment experiences of others as well
929350 paf is among the leaders in the gaming industry that have realized fraud prevention should not be done alone and this is precisely where ethoca shines ethoca can help companies improve checks against their own experiences but what makes the community so unique is the complete knowledge it provides from the experiences of others

929479 to ensure we continue the a1gp tradition of strong racing coupled with lots of overtaking the effort of the design team has been to provide a chassis that has a good level of down force but without the normal penalties this will make for much closer racing particularly in the corners as cars will be able to run together we have spent in excess of 300 hours in the wind tunnel and have tried hundreds of different aerodynamic variations to ensure the close exciting racing the series is famous for not only continues but gets better

929491 cheney and addington and bush actively relentlessly and surreptitiously broke the law rescinded the geneva conventions approved memos that are laughable hack work in retrospect used false confessions procured by torture as rationales to go to war and destroyed the moral reputation of the us the honor of the armed services and the rule of law
929492 america doesnt pardon war criminals it prosecutes and in the past has even executed them for the same techniques that bush and rumsfeld and cheney endorsed
929493 possibly i feel this way because i liked taking soft drugs when i was a teenager myself my fondness for marijuana got me expelled from boarding school in fact due to an unfortunate incident during an italian translation class
929494 the fact is that this had only positive consequences i changed schools stopped having to play bloody lacrosse the sheer hell of which had sent me in search of new pastimes in the first place moved home to london regained normal freedoms and occasionally took more drugs by the time i went to university i had grown bored with the druggy scene and had evolved enough to get over the sense that drugs were exciting and naughty an insight i observe that still eludes many less precocious middle aged types 20 odd years later

929497 the new dividing line between labour and the tories is less about a left right split than about an authoritarian approach on one side and a more liberal one on the other and labour are on the wrong side of it many of their social and economic policies may have failed but where they have succeeded is in developing a targeting controlling distrustful state from the micromanagement of civil servants teachers doctors and the police to id cards super databases and the growth of surveillance the governments answer to too many problems has been the removal of autonomy from individuals and more oversight from whitehall
929498 al qaidas resilience should trigger a fundamental rethinking of u s strategy key to this strategy is replacing the war on terrorism orientation with the kind of counterterrorism approach that is employed by most governments facing significant terrorist threats today calling the efforts a war on terrorism raises public expectations both in the united states and elsewhere that there is a battlefield solution it also tends to legitimize the terrorists view that they are conducting a jihad holy war against the united states and elevates them to the status of holy warriors terrorists should be perceived as criminals not holy warriors

929500 we shot it in june and we find out i think in mid august glenn gordon caron i knew he was so talented from all of this projects hes made but working with him i was more and more in awe of him as the days progressed which is usually not what happens he was just so wonderful to work with that i hope it will become a series
929501 she wakes up in this in between world thats not heaven or hell
929502 its sort of this next place you go its sort of this master control realm theyre giving her an orientation and she meets this person who ioan gruffudd plays and shes basically told that shes dead and has this new job now helping people on earth straighten out their lives shed led a very frivolous life and shes not the kindest of people so when she dies she realizes there is something to be said about being a good person
929503 a good film is very hard to make whatever kind of film it is because it has to go beyond whatever genre it is to make it a great film period its about telling a great story thats intriguing that builds that builds the characters thats multidimensional and is going somewhere interesting and i think also for horror films there are only so many scary horror films you can make

929527 evidence from swedish collecting societies shows that following a copyright term increase of 20 years payments to dead composers leapt from 2 4 per cent in 1995 to 14 1 per cent in 2006 copyright term extension for sound recordings will lead to a similar effect in favour of the estates of best selling and in all likelihood dead performing artists the increased earnings for struggling artists will be minimal it wont keep starving artists off the poverty line

929529 still today 800 years later magna carta resonates to no man will we deny to no man will we delay justice and right
929530 what existential threat do we face greater than those of the past 800 years what great terror exists today that not civil war not world war nor recent other terrorisms could make our forefathers change the fundamental basis of this state what is so dangerous that our oldest statutes could be upended for such a haporth of momentary panic
929531 there are many political disputes probably most composed of two or more reasonable sides whether the u s government has committed war crimes by torturing detainees conduct that is illegal under domestic law and international treaties which are binding law in this country isnt an example of a reasonable two sided political dispute nor is the issue of whether the u s government and the telecom industry engaged in illegal acts for years by spying on americans without warrants nor is the question of whether we should allow government officials to break our laws at will by claiming that doing so is necessary to keep us safe
929532 entrenching civil liberties matters because it is always in the interests of authorities to make it easier for themselves to exercise their authority and to impose their will so there is always a tendency towards limitation of freedom in the name of efficiency security the majority or some greater good such as public health as governments try social engineering schemes at the outset always with the best intentions so the mission creep of directing controlling and improving by force occurs and with it the loss of the physical and psychological space around each individual that makes life worth living
929533 there is no longer a case for taking 4 billion a year from the public to produce programmes they do not want or can obtain free elsewhere if there is a demand for a particular programme the broadcasting market will supply that demand without the licence fee
929534 so the real questions are do we need the bbc at all and if we do need it how can we save it
929535 there is insufficient evidence available to allow independent observers to state reliably whether the results declared in the may 2008 elections for the mayor of london and the london assembly are an accurate representation of voters intentions
929536 religious doctrine is a menace that has spattered the world with blood as it now spatters it with acrimony rival narratives are deeply embedded in every communitys dna the shrill conflicts of ulster still enshrined in its politics and in public policy on schools and housing show how fragile is the veneer of civilisation over the rock of religious bigotry
929537 simply put the internet is fundamentally incompatible with the music industrys sales based revenue model
929538 the industrys efforts to salvage its sales based revenue model have compelled it to resist consumer demand for full unfettered drm free access to music blocked consumer electronics makers and technology firms from offering new products with next generation capabilities limited the growth of webcasting and other digital audio services chilled free speech and interfered with academic freedom on university campuses caused distortions in the music licensing marketplace relegated consumers to black market services where adware spyware and privacy violations abound and exposed consumers to ruinous infringement liability damages for conduct occurring in the privacy of their homes
929539 and for it all the industrys efforts have resulted in fewer licensed transmissions of fewer works and slowed the growth of royalties that songwriters music publishers recording artists and record labels otherwise may have earned

929544 lots of people are used to seeing me as kaylee from firefly who is very innocent and naive and sweet shes loving and kind of wears her heart on her sleeve and dr keller is not that she has secrets she is reserved she has a lot of anxiety about her she doesnt really warm to people right away but she also has that same quality that kaylee had where shes pretty much friends with everybody
929545 i think keller knows in her heart that she should not pursue her relationship with ronon but its just this physical attraction but she has a very intellectual attraction with mckay and i think she understands him in a way that a lot of other people dont when hes complaining and going on and on about how terrible things are and how sick he is or whatever she just kind of has a way of dissipating that in him and going okay you know what rodney just chill out so yeah with those two shes eventually going to have to make a choice

929581 we all love our dogs but its worth remembering that when they spend a lot of time inside they tend to smell the place up when you live with it every day you get used to odour le canine but when it comes to selling your home your dog might not be your best friend
929582 it really is important for sellers to make an effort in this buyers market a good rule to remember is that what you are really selling is a lifestyle not just bricks and mortar people need to be able to picture themselves in your home so too much of your personality and taste on show will make it harder for them to do that

929598 con el prop sito de contribuir y ahondar el esp ritu democr tico presento en este momento una iniciativa de reforma constitucional al art culo 78 a fin de modificar la din mica del informe de gobierno para favorecer un mejor an lisis de la actuaci n del poder p blico por parte de la representatividad popular desterrando esquemas b sicamente protocolarios para abandonar con hechos a la reforma de estado de los mexicanos
929599 los panistas nunca cumplen ya estaba visto pero hoy m s ahora lo que preocupa es que el gobernador no se presente a las mesas de trabajo donde haremos la glosa del informe
929600 el nuevo esquema es un avance importante que se acord para la rendici n del informe pero creemos que a n persisten ciertas conductas como la de dar un mensaje que no estaba convenido por los coordinadores
929601 est en su derecho hacerlo habr que escuchar que es lo que dice no se si les llamar concretamente informes l oliva puede expresarse ante la ciudadan a el constitucionalmente ha entregando al congreso el informe que es como se cumple con la ley
929602 hasta se tom la molestia de anunciar una iniciativa de ley creo que los acuerdos deben cumplirse no se respetaron s lo ten a que venir presentar su informe y retirarse y no lo hizo trae mucha faramalla trae porras es una verg enza
929603 es que simplemente no es posible quiso dar madruguete porque el pri iba a presentar una iniciativa similar no puede decir l que propuso el cambio al formato y lo que puedo decir es que el gobernador se vio muy mal pero tambi n el presidente del congreso por hab rsela recibido
929604 oliva tendr que volverla a presentar a trav s de la secretar a general del congreso y luego se le dar tr mite pero por ahora cay una vez m s en la ilegalidad
929605 es una modalidad que va acorde con los nuevos tiempos es m s democr tico m s respetuoso de la divisi n de poderes y nos da gusto que as ocurra
929606 tiene innovaciones lo que en una poca fue un acto pr cticamente para darle una gran relevancia a la persona como un presidente de la rep blica a un gobernador de un alcalde pues hoy se tiene en un r gimen de equilibrio de poderes de una colaboraci n de instituciones a mi me parece que es m s sobrio y que permitir la revisi n del documento
929607 era anacr nico el informe que se estaba analizando anteriormente sin embargo al momento que analicemos el informe de gobierno ya en la glosa ser a importante que estuviera el gobernador para que nos informara de primera mano si no nos hace lo que el a o pasado en que las fechas de trabajo que tuvimos con los diferentes funcionarios realmente no tuvieron ning n sentido porque no respondieron pero creo que en principio es bueno
929608 celebro el formato del informe esto va a tono va acorde con las modificaciones con las modificaciones que hemos hecho en el congreso de la uni n lo m s importante es que estemos enterados del por qu se modific esto un pa s donde estamos trascendiendo consolidando la democracia donde debe haber una relaci n sana entre poderes no puede estar sujeto a actos fara nicos

929876 this is like something out of a book one of those travel memoirs about the tired business man who moves to the south of france and buys a vineyard or the heartbroken writer who runs off to italy and does well she does exactly what were going right now
929877 sit down and eat i swear i think it would kill you to sit still
929878 im pretty sure it shouldnt be this light out here its all a little too perfect dont you think
929879 not that i dont think it should be perfect i guess this is just so different from anything ive ever known well not ever i kind of feel the way i did when i was a kid and we would go on vacation we used to go to this lake i have no idea where it was but i remember it was always so quiet and there was absolutely nothing that you had to do i hated it
929880 but now i can see why my parents loved it so much
929881 i cant even imagine living in the city anymore i put in my dues and now i like my silence you like it too when youre quiet enough to hear it
929882 i am sweet and just to prove it i think we should honor your memory of that lake and go for a swim
929883 this could have been where they filmed all of those old monster movies
929884 actually a lot of those movies were filmed about ten miles from here but dont worry they had to bring their own monsters
929885 i really thought that when you suggested a swim you meant in the pool
929886 im not sure its fair that i have to go first i am the one whos new at this
929887 why are we leaving i would have done it eventually
929888 jack this is my home you cant follow me to a place where i already am you have to find your way alone

929891 thanks but i only need 1934 and 1936 so this is perfect
929892 glad i could help i dont know what the hell im looking for anyway

929894 david mccormick im doing a paper on the long term effects that movies filmed on location here in florida have had on the location they were filmed the old tarzan movies were filmed in north florida the second one was 34 and the third movie was in 36
929895 im trying to see how big a deal the movies were when they were first filmed compared to the lingering tourist interest
929896 not nearly as explosively as id hoped there were a lot of movies filmed in the state and most of them were shot in sleepy little places that are too out of the way to have large tourist draws most of my data is kind of useless but the paper is due on monday ill bluff it out somehow
929897 you do realize that you havent called me in a month
929898 a month i will accept two excuses for this 1 you have been finishing the book and its about to be published and make you millions of dollars and disgustingly famous and you are planning on taking me with you or b you have a man

929917 thats good thats very good especially if by first draft you really mean fifth like you usually do listen send me your next chapters as you lay them down i love receiving in bulk but we can get this out a lot sooner if youll let me work with you instead of after you and send me what you have on this new idea maybe i can get you some money

929920 whats wrong with a simple hello i swear its like no one appreciates the simple niceties anymore

929934 one interpretation of these studies is that men are unable to ward off temptation
929935 we do not subscribe to this instead we believe men simply interpret these interactions differently than women do we think that if men believed an attractive available woman was a threat to their relationship they might try to protect that relationship
929936 these findings show that even if a man is committed to his relationship he may still need to formulate strategies to protect his relationship by avoiding that available attractive woman
929937 the success rate of such strategies may not be 100 percent but it is likely to be significantly higher than if the man was not made aware of the specific consequences of his actions

929945 it was quickly rectified and there were no safety implications at any time
929946 we experience these sorts of delays right across our business
929947 the pre flight inspections are done as part of the safety systems within qantas and every other airline for that matter for this exact reason to find anything the crew or the engineers are not happy with
929948 there are so many potential problems that can be picked up before the aircraft is in the air it was a hydraulic leak a very routine event
929949 it shows that the safety system is working as it should in fact we should all be encouraged that the systems are working well
929950 we dont have any evidence before us that qantas safety systems are not working or that there are links between these events or that there are any safety problems within qantas
929951 we do know we have no systemic problem in this company
929952 i mean we are still probably the safest airline flying around
