6850000 so i think its going to be interesting in that regard
6850001 for the starting group this is the one that is most game like
6850002 you are going to play a whole half and you usually come out in the second half and play that first series you really try to go out there and be sharp and make sure that everybody is on the same page you are making plays you are not having the mental mistakes and you have put all that beside us and we are out there executing our game plan pretty well
6850003 you always enjoy being able to simulate being on the road because it prepares you for the regular season
6850004 last year we proved we did a good job of handling that winning 11 straight games away from home it will be a good test and the fans will be energized with the team obviously with brett there is a lot of enthusiasm right now so im sure it will be a great opportunity for us to work against crowd noise and feel like the away team
6850005 i just helped us get to where we wanted to be which was the super bowl thats all it was good for the second play from scrimmage in ot i was able to make a good play on the ball and get tynes on the field to kick the field goal
6850006 my quarterback is eli so thats who im rooting for were going to go out there and do what we do on defense which is put pressure on the quarterback and create turnovers

6850033 unknown political risk and constant negative headlines are not likely to induce investors to buy
6850034 we were concerned that the declining oil price and the mechel case would put pressure on the margins of companies and hence their earnings
6850035 foreigners are selling out bonds which is seen from bigger spreads and stocks which is clear from declining benchmarks
6850036 while many investors were plainly shocked by the escalation of the conflict with georgia we think that those bold enough to increase their russia exposure at this time of perceived elevated political risk may be rewarded
6850037 although volatility can be unwelcome in the short term it is precisely at times such as this that active managers can take advantage of market inefficiencies
6850038 we believe the long term investment case for russia is compelling

6850050 historically marketing budgets are among the first to be cut in a budget crunch but marketers should be cautious about trying to find a quick fix
6850051 in fact spending more during tough times when competitors may be scaling back is a good way to strategically boost market share because this often helps brands come out ahead when the economy rebounds before rushing to slash marketing spending it is important to carefully evaluate how effective short term budget management can lead to significant long term benefits
6850052 effective marketing spending during economic downturns is not about how much you spend but how you spend it
6850053 marketers must assess how consumers and customer behavior can be positively influenced during tough times if it can then marketers should give increased consideration to more spending rather than cutting
6850054 since my appointment as ceo the management team has been dedicated to harnessing pxls expertise in biomarker discovery and development to produce a pipeline of diagnostic products based on the companys proprietary platform simply put the eukarion portfolio no longer fits with our corporate development strategy
6850055 pxl must remain focused on allocating resources to leverage the progress made with our two near term revenue generating programs tb amp wheatrite tm to consolidate the companys role as a leader in developing point of need diagnostic tests for infectious and respiratory diseases
6850056 we believe this compelling combination would create a strong platform for sustainable long term growth to better address the changing healthcare industry and provide meaningful cost effective medicines that improve the quality of life for patients
6850057 the transaction would create a diversified specialty pharmaceutical company with greater commercialization capabilities an expanded portfolio of pain management products and a strengthened pipeline which would include multiple platform technologies
6850058 our 33 00 per share all cash proposal provides alpharma stockholders with a substantial cash premium for their investment in the company we are confident that this combination would deliver significant benefits and superior value to our respective stockholders and employees and create a stronger platform to deliver innovation to patients prescribers and customers importantly it would also further diversify kings business with an additional source of steady cash flow from alpharmas animal health division a leading feed additives business in addition a combination with alpharma would deliver significant synergies
6850059 we believe our all cash proposal is too compelling to ignore in light of the fact that the alpharma board declined this proposal we think it is important for the stockholders of both companies to be aware of this exciting opportunity it remains our strong preference to work cooperatively with alpharma regarding this proposal

6850109 it appears as if there is a fear that if this is honestly discussed people will hate all illegal immigrants so there is silence but in being silent about the rapes and murders it is as if the victims never even existed
6850110 gang rapes by illegal immigrants appear to be gang related many of the cases i reviewed involved gang members as part of being a cohesive group they offend together inflicting brutal gang rapes brings them closer together as a group it is a way to demonstrate their power and it sends a message to anyone who dares to cross them
6850111 these are just the ones we know of the real number is much higher
6850112 many illegal aliens have a rape and pillage mentality toward america
6850113 the government has shown them they can break our laws on many levels without much fear of enforcement why should they think of rape or gang rape any differently
6850114 illegal aliens are more likely to engage in these crimes because rapes and gang rapes are much more common in the gang rule third world areas they come from
6850115 these gangs are forcing new female gang members to undergo gang rape to enter the gang and they are asking their male initiates to gang rape american women to become an official member of the gang
6850116 illegal aliens have been walking out of american prisons after serving their time at taxpayer expense without being deported our government cant or wont find the hundreds of thousands of known felon illegal aliens walking americas streets tonight much less stop the new felons coming in tonight across our unsecured borders
6850117 illegal immigrants who commit sex crimes first cross the u s border illegally then gradually commit worse crimes and are continually released back into society or deported those who were deported simply returned illegally again there is a clear pattern of criminal escalation from misdemeanors such as assault or dui to drug offenses illegal immigrants who commit sex crimes break u s laws repeatedly
6850118 we need to know who is coming into this country it is a matter of security life and death our borders should be secured so that those with evil intentions cannot enter we need more border patrol agents more training for these agents and a commitment that we will not tolerate predators coming into this country there must be security and a return to the rule of law
6850119 a failure that puts criminal aliens back on the streets instead of deporting them
6850120 gang rape is a form of terrorism it has been used throughout history as a weapon of terror
6850121 most americans do not see the war that is already upon us in our communities and neighborhoods
6850122 they punched me so hard that i was knocked to the floor
6850123 and this motion is expected to continue during the next 24 to 36 hours

6850139 the government has made little effort to dismantle the torture camps and bases established by zanu pf and its allies since the first round of elections on march 29
6850140 in the past four months zanu pf and its allies have been implicated in the killing of at least 163 people and the beating and torture of more than 5 000 others thirty two of these people were killed after the run off and two since zanu pf and the mdc signed a memorandum of understanding mou on july 21
6850141 zanu pf and its allies are still committing violent abuses undermining the partys credibility as a political partner
6850142 the ongoing tragedy has been exacerbated by an increasingly dire humanitarian situation
6850143 severe government restrictions on the distribution of humanitarian assistance including food aid by local and international agencies have had a devastating impact on people in the rural areas of zimbabwe
6850144 last week the wife of mdc activist killion chirawo was abducted and beaten by zanu pf youths who were looking for her husband
6850145 they went back to chirawos house and when they did not find him they chased after his brother moses chirawo fortunately he managed to escape the police tell us that they do not have powers to help us because of chinotimbas position in zanu pf and in the war veterans association
6850146 darius has been in twice for workouts with us and has impressed us with his progress health and attitude
6850147 darius will have the next couple of months to prove to myself and coach doc rivers that he can help us win
6850148 given the serious nature of his knee injury we agree with the doctors conclusion that darius has sustained a career ending injury
6850149 this allows darius and the trail blazers to move forward and achieve closure
6850150 ive watched the boston celtics play a lot last year and loved what i saw in their teamwork and chemistry on the court and its the team that i want to try to resume my career with

6850152 zanu pf is likely to back a candidate from mutambaras faction
6850153 zanu pf were initially prepared to back ncube but he said no
6850154 tsvangirais faction had however rejected the proposal of ncube as speaker preferring gibson sibanda
6850155 zanu pf is aware that a combined opposition vote will result in an mdc tsvangirai speaker and in a bid to divide the opposition they are backing nyathis candidacy so as to frustrate the mdc tsvangirai
6850156 the partys national council met on wednesday and endorsed paul themba nyathi as our speaker of parliament candidate and we believe as a smaller party in parliament we can provide a neutral speaker not from zanu pf or the mdc tsvangirai faction who will lead constructive debates
6850157 the matter is internal and divulging such information is not strategic
6850158 at this stage it would not be suitable for me to disclose the candidate we have but we are vying for the speakers position
6850159 after the swearing in ceremonies members of the house of assembly and senators will respectively proceed to elect the speaker and deputy speaker of the house of assembly and the president and the deputy president of the senate in accordance with provisions of sections 35 and 39 of the constitution

6850170 the update on the deadline is nothing is going to happen with it thats whats going to happen with that i dont care about how many threats shaw wants to pull well be doing a press conference if elitexc doesnt see the light here pretty soon and if shaw doesnt stop talking expletive
6850171 as far as nick diaz hes not the no 1 contender out there to elitexc he is hes the number one for getting eyeballs to watch them theyre pushing on eyeballs versus a career move for a champion like kj kj is really not the one who gets anything out of the fight diaz does and so does proelite
6850172 forget 5 oclock i aint waiting until 5 oclock if elitexc officials are holding their breath then someones going to pass out
6850173 i would think eddie alvarez is the no 1 contender hes definitely ranked higher than nick diaz kj already beat nick diaz
6850174 eddie alvarez is getting married but thats not our problem people get married in five or 10 minutes
6850175 look at brandon vera he had a long layoff but hes making more money than the no 1 ranked expletive fighter in the world anderson silva or the same amount
6850176 and now anderson silva is getting bud light sponsorships from ufc president dana white handed down to him
6850177 who do you think negotiated that expletive contract a year and a half ago and if you look at my post it the one i negotiated was a 7 million deal for four years its nothing close to 100 000 and 100 000 as a win bonus as far as trying to bring in the mark dion negatives and stuff good luck show me any negatives on it and thats just a pitch elitexc can use but hey i know my expletive ive been around this sport a long long time
6850178 i would say the only guarantee k j has is to pull up a chair and watch the event and get comfortable on that chair because hell be sitting for a little bit
6850179 the prudent thing would be to enlist the help of the media and tell homeowners make sure your animals have flea collars
6850180 its an abrogation of responsibility and its a violation of the public trust
6850181 the sooner you let everybody know the better it is for your ability to control the disease
6850182 it leaves us absolutely vulnerable and damned near unable to respond a bioterrorism event
6850183 if i lived in austin i dont think i could trust my health department to do the right thing to protect my family and myself and if i was in practice there i would think golly gee did i miss this in some of my patients
6850184 we didnt get a good handle until the last four weeks
6850185 its aggravating to be that ill and not be tested for typhus
6850186 he might not be on the ufc 92 card though but i really dont know for sure now but im thinking hes not going to be on that at this point
6850187 the pattern was people in certain long term care facilities
6850188 the median age in the males is 76 and in the females is 80
6850189 this is a company that has a culture of food safety
6850190 were taking appropriate broad comprehensive and definitive action as it relates to this facility this involves people we want people to understand theres a recall we want people to have that information
6850191 i strongly advise the public especially those at high risk for listeriosis to make sure they avoid consuming these products
6850192 i have also asked all public health units to advise emergency rooms in their jurisdictions to be on alert for cases all suspect and confirmed cases of listeriosis must be reported immediately to local public health units and in turn to the ministry within one business day of notification of report
6850193 they would simply not use the meat they would move into other foods its as simple as that
6850194 people arent going to take a chance the products theyre talking about arent ones that are a heavy part of menus in most of the homes i havent heard from anybody who has an issue over this
6850195 to predict when youre going to complete an investigation is practically impossible

6850203 it was a bit of a shock to us i cant make it a one man show or the tito ortiz show giving him more than a guy like fedor who is coming in here with a winning record i was disappointed i was shocked it was almost like dont even bother calling back because there is no point in making a deal here it was aggressive
6850204 theres nothing concrete as of yet if we can come to something great if not so be it
6850205 i think titos obviously a good draw and hed be good to have for a show to say anything else would be stupid however that draw comes with an expense in the cost benefit analysis the question is is it worth it the answer is at those numbers definitely not

6850212 dear family friends fans and public i did not use the steroid boldenone or any other steroid of prohibited substance i dont agree and never have agreed with the use of this kind of product in order to win for this is cheating i will go to the full extent of my power and the law to prove my innocence in this matter
6850213 my friends antonio is one of the hardest working most serious athletes i know he also is a man that holds high his principles we dont know at this point how he tested positive for a horse steroid but what we do know is that he doesnt make use of these kind of products however we will find out or die trying we are always reading about guys getting caught and declaring their innocence and it is always met with a degree of skepticism but the truth is that career hurting mistakes are being made and it is high time the we find out how and why they happen we are extremely sure of ourselves in this matter and are willing to go to the very gates of hell to prove that we are being wronged hopefully this will not only clear antonio but also help clear other peolple that have had the same thing happen to them
6850214 i read the paper and listened to the radio i could not attend school to learn because i worked six days a week

6850219 the forces of inflation and deflation are now fighting each other for the first time since 2001 and ultimately inflation will win
6850220 for the fed and other central banks the strategy is to rescue the global financial system from the economic abyss or deflation that means print credit like theres no tomorrow
6850221 the fed the ecb the bank of japan and their international buddies are going to accelerate the expansion of credit to avoid a devastating deflation thus im betting on inflation im also betting on gold my gold stocks

6850259 chelsea have a great squad a great team and their offer is good for me
6850260 it isnt because of money it is simply because i want to leave my personal aim is to be the best player in the world and that isnt going to be possible at real madrid
6850261 ive finished my cycle ive played three seasons at real madrid and have given everything
6850262 i have scored goals won two leagues and that isnt easy i think my period at real madrid has come to an end i hope the directors reach an agreement with chelsea to resolve my situation as quickly as possible

6850265 blackburn rovers are delighted to announce that roque santa cruz has signed a new four year contract with the club running through until 2012
6850266 i dont think any player certainly not those two will be leaving
6850267 as a blackburn fan it would be a tragedy if they left so im sure the club wouldnt allow that
6850268 roque is a tremendous player as is benni we are a club that is trying to achieve things ourselves and you couldnt let brad friedel david bentley and roque santa cruz go in the same season theres no way the club will let that happen
6850269 i want to create a single voice for both teams to listen to and understand there are serious impacts of what they are doing to their truest and most loyal fans who have been with them for decades this is one issue that fans of both teams can stand behind
6850270 sadly the giants management is literally putting a price tag on loyalty
6850271 the years countless fans have spent in the same seats cheering through the good times and the bad now are worthless thousands more who have spent generations on the season ticket waiting list will now see their rightful place in line taken by someone whose only prerequisite is the ability to write a big check

6850294 according to multiple sources there is no backside to the existing contract between favre and the jets
6850295 favre if willing is free to make appearances on behalf of the jets to promote the team as it starts to play in a new stadium next season but he has no contractual obligation to do so
6850296 as for the favre contract that sounds right packer fans wanted to see him now and again other than on sundays it was a big deal to us to jets fans not so much
6850297 when i negotiated this 10 year 101m contract in 2001 it required as all packer contracts do a number of appearances on behalf of the club some workers compensation guidelines and bonus recovery provisions in case of immoral behavior or retirement those clauses are standard boilerplate in the industry now in year eight of ten that contract was assigned to the jets in the recent trade
6850298 i am so impressed with your ability to complain anonymously through the js blog
6850299 with tt well be in constant rebuilding mode the guy lives for the drafts that is his highlight of the year the rest of the year must be a drag for him
6850300 favre can also retire from the jets at any time and have no obligation to forfeit any of the bonus monies that he has received
6850301 ok so we deliver a treadmill to mccarthys hotel room and find out he wanted an elliptical instead
6850302 favre can retire from the jets anytime and have no obligation to forfeit the bonus money he received

6850314 when these folks came in as temporary workers it was purely temporary and they were absolutely ineligible to apply for permanent residency
6850315 the problem is obviously that these foreign workers didnt have the option of being permanent and therefore dont have the option of bringing family members over here
6850316 worse case scenario if they assert their rights too loudly their contract can be terminated and they can ultimately be deported
6850317 there are folks in our region that are working in those categories and now the opportunity to sponsor their husbands and children is a reality but its still a long process but its pretty huge for the people who are in those categories
6850318 so i think its a real step in the right direction
6850319 its not a total fix for issues with immigration but i do think its a step in the right direction
6850320 when one door is closed people seek to open other doors it seems likely that it will have an impact on people trying to come into canada

6850837 die strecke ist nicht nur sehr schnell sondern auch extrem sicher
6850838 mir w re es lieber wenn die barrieren n her an der fahrbahn stehen w rden
6850839 ich denke dass einige fahrer mehr vom gas gehen wenn die barrieren so nahe sind auf einem stadtkurs kann ein fahrer schnellster sein auch wenn er nicht das beste auto hat
6850840 ich bin berw ltigt und der gl cklichste mensch der welt
6850841 das fechten war der grundstein ich hatte gutes tempo eine gute spitze

6850849 ich habe ihn r de angemacht und gefragt ob er noch alle tassen im schrank habe
6850850 er hat einen auf die arrogante tour gemacht und mich angeblafft wer bist du eigentlich der es wagen kann mich hier so anzumachen
6850851 der deutsche turner bund muss froh sein dass er mit einem team hamb chen arbeiten darf wolfgang willam ist total unten durch der muss weg
6850852 ich habe meine einsch tzung nicht auf das reck sondern seine gesamtform bezogen
6850853 ich war in superform noch nie so gut drauf ich hatte die meisten finals und damit das h rteste programm das habe ich durchgestanden psychisch und physisch war ich super drauf
6850854 das ist supergeil meine h nde zittern total jetzt gehen wir ins deutsche haus und trinken ein bier
6850855 eigentlich hatte ich mich gerade auf ein paar freie tage und die u23 em eingestellt dann kam der anruf
6850856 ich bin der kraftprotz und andi die kleine kampfsau das passt einfach genial
6850857 jetzt fehlt nur noch ein schritt um sich unsterblich zu machen und den gehen wir jetzt auch noch
6850858 mir geht es weniger um die medaille als um die leistung meiner spieler und darauf bin ich besonders stolz egal ob wir diese medaille gewinnen oder nicht
6850859 endlich ist der tag gekommen an dem wir uns den traum erf llen k nnen von dem vorher so viel geredet worden ist
6850860 ich habe keinen kontakt zu florian und mache mir gro e sorgen bin aber auch stolz auf ihn
6850861 ich w nsche ihm die kraft die tage im gef ngnis gut durchzustehen
6850862 wir best rken die chinesische regierung darin respekt f r die menschenrechte zu zeigen w hrend der olympischen spiele und dar ber hinaus
6850863 die sommerspiele waren gepr gt von zensur schikane und verurteilungen
6850864 daf r muss auch das internationale olympische komitee verantwortung bernehmen es hat beispiellose feigheit an den tag gelegt
6850865 the chief did not like to lose the horses so they decided to have another contest that was to climb by night a mountain without using the trail ucanogos and some of the indian maidens would be waiting on the top of the mountain
6850866 and this motion is expected to continue during the next 24 to 36 hours
6850867 over the next 36 hours fay is expected to produce rainfall accumulations of four to six inches 10 to 15 cm across northern florida and the surrounding region which includes southern georgia and south eastern alabama
6850868 we made a big emphasis on getting better with set pieces
6850869 we have the tools to finish the ball off and this year our services have been a lot better and are getting the ball into the spots they need to
6850870 skowneski has great pace up top and she is very good on the ball
6850871 she has been a great addition and nikolette rivera was big for us today controlling the midfield

6850873 celebrities dont have to worry about family budgets but we sure do
6850874 die hamburger innenstadt wird sowohl per pkw als auch mit bus und bahn gut zu erreichen sein
6850875 wer h tte das denn machen sollen es tut uns leid f r die autofahrer aber vielleicht liegen die auswirkungen ja auch daran dass gestern besonders viel verkehr in der innenstadt war
6850876 wir waren zwar bei den vorgespr chen anwesend doch solch eine absprache hat es definitiv nie gegeben
6850877 ich kann gar nicht sagen wie w tend ich bin
6850878 der sieht ja aus wie hannes aber der ist ja leider tot
6850879 es ist als ob er niemals weg gewesen w re
6850880 ich bin sehr froh dass die einb rgerung endlich abgeschlossen ist ich m chte allen danken die dazu beigetragen haben es hat ja sehr lange gedauert insgesamt etwa acht monate

6850882 felles for samtlege anslag mot usa er at det er islamistiske terroristar som st r bak
6850883 our infernal voyage in usa was nothing but a pure success
6850884 theres plenty of other promoters and grotesque freaks that we would like to say thanks and hell o to right now but you guys will be mentioned on the next album for sure
6850885 worth mentioning also is that during the last show in nashville tennessee nominon celebrated their 100th show
6850886 people who think gay athletes have a responsibility to come out publicly need to wake up to the fact that the olympics games are not about their ulterior motives
6850887 outside of the olympics maybe these individuals should be working toward gay rights and human
6850888 so lange die aktionen den flugverkehr nicht beeintr chtigen ist es f r uns okay
6850889 wir mussten wegen der demo extra eine halbe stunde fr her losfahren sonst h tten wir es nicht geschafft eine freundin gab uns den tipp
6850890 die murksereien und die hudelei der lehrzeit werden dadurch abgewaschen
6850891 am 1 januar geburtstag zu haben hat meiner meinung nach nur vorteile es gibt doch nichts sch neres als wenn die welt mit einem zusammen feiert man hat nur fr hliche leute um sich egal wo man in der nacht zum 1 januar gerade ist
6850892 wir haben in m nchen einen punkt geholt nun sollen es drei sein ich erwarte ein gutes spiel in dem wir uns viele torchancen herausspielen und keine gegentreffer bekommen
6850893 das ist auf jeden fall etwas besonderes die stimmung wird mit sicherheit sehr gut sein
6850894 wir wollen keine eskalation und niemand soll durch die aktion verletzt werden aber wir werden uns von der polizei auch nicht aufhalten lassen
6850895 so lange die aktionen den flugverkehr nicht beeintr chtigen ist es f r uns okay
6850896 wir mussten wegen der demo extra eine halbe stunde fr her losfahren sonst h tten wir es nicht geschafft eine freundin gab uns den tipp
6850897 gerade dieser fall zeigt die brutalit t und menschenverachtung der t ter
6850898 this price drop was impacted mostly by factors that are irrelevant to the companys fundamentals
6850899 minority shareholders worry less about shareholder conflicts than the possibility to earn some money or about losing less in the worst case
6850900 uc rusal has consistently advocated that funds not used in investment programmes should be distributed among all shareholders by way of a dividend
6850901 a dividend payment would not infringe upon the rights of minority shareholders who have no intention to sell their shares
6850902 in the last three years the shareholders of norilsk nickel received more than 8 billion as a result of stock buybacks or buyouts and in the form of dividends
6850903 the share buyback will be conducted in accordance with best corporate governance practices in an absolutely transparent manner ensuring equal access for all shareholders
6850904 das tut weh mehr im kopf als in den armen
6850905 der sport hat mir ja schon so viele sch ne erlebnisse gebracht ich stand so oft oben auf dem podest das kann mir keiner nehmen
6850906 ein schmerzliches gef hl das rennen war nicht nach meinem geschmack ich konnte das tempo nicht mithalten

6850914 i had the good fortune to attend the grand opening party of mnkythmp tonight and am very sure this salon has done its homework and will
6850915 ok well can you help me out with an appointment
6850916 a few years ago someone told me about this 17 year old girl who got pregnant by my friend and wanted to have an abortion because she was terrified that her parents would know she was pregnant
6850917 i met with her boyfriend who was a soldier and he wasnt prepared to listen to me and even warned me that if she ends up giving birth he is out of the picture because his parents cannot know about this
6850918 when she entered her seventh month one of the associations donors agreed to contribute the wedding costs
6850919 they got married and had a son and today they have three children
6850920 it is atrocious to make a woman do something by economic enticement and by instilling the fear that if they have an abortion bad things will happen despite the fact that they decided the opposite
6850921 this is a process supported by religious groups in order to scare women under the guise of motherhood and show them how good they will have it and how important this is and that they are actually saving them
6850922 if a woman has already come to sit in front of the pregnancy termination committee and some person comes and successfully convinces her or her husband to quickly alter their decision by promising them the world it doesnt sound serious to me it isnt right and it isnt fair
6850923 one individual got down from the vehicle and started moving towards the checkpost he was cautioned to stop and on refusal was engaged with fire resultantly he exploded
6850924 the vehicle was engaged with fire by the security forces due to which the vehicle also exploded

6850930 ich lasse mich vom olympia schein hier ganz bestimmt nicht einlullen
6850931 ich habe mich daran gew hnt dass kurzfristig etwas passiert ich bin weiter positiv wir haben noch m glichkeiten etwas zu ver ndern sonst w re es ein albtraum

6850934 miro ist in einer aufbauphase bei ihm fehlt es noch im eins gegen eins und bei der explosivit t aber das ist nach so einer em ganz normal
6850935 man merkt jetzt dass der vierte platz der bitterste berhaupt ist wenn man mit nichts in den h nden dasteht
6850936 es war erschreckend wie wir uns in der ersten h lfte pr sentiert haben
6850937 das gl ck das wir in athen hatten hat hier gefehlt

6850976 one skilled in the science of joining together in an orderly fashion the knowledge of one field of learning with that of other fields
6850977 although i have read the ny times almost daily since junior high school it wasnt until my politics matured that i realized its function as the establishments official line of right thinking
6850978 you always want to know that when you work hard on these things that justice is going to prevail and today it did
6850979 conform to the environmental and social guidelines of the venezuelan government
6850980 it shows that theyre well on the road but still investors will not be satisfied until they get the environment permit

6850992 we were trying to do the subtlest of subtle things
6850993 drr that was a lot of big serious words that i didnt understand and because i have no idea how to respond i will react like a big dumb fucking ape and hang up the phone bitch
6850994 and this motion is expected to continue during the next 24 to 36 hours
6850995 over the next 36 hours fay is expected to produce rainfall accumulations of four to six inches 10 to 15 cm across northern florida and the surrounding region which includes southern georgia and south eastern alabama

6851003 knowing what youre voting for is fundamental to our democracy
6851004 if the secretary of state does not clearly let voters know they are choosing between 400 percent interest and 36 percent interest she is aiding and abetting payday lenders whose very business relies on this kind of deception
6851005 the voters deserve to know the actual effect of their votes
6851006 the law requires it and we know that such clarity is your objective as well therefore we believe the language needs to be amended
6851007 if the payday lending industry is going to come into our state and ask us to make their predatory lending practices permanent the voters should at least know what they are voting on
6851008 then nobody can say nobody said we cant do it

6851019 superman didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to
6851020 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned
6851021 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009
6851022 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all
6851023 along those lines we have been developing every dc character that we own

6851030 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women
6851031 on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
6851032 emotional stress is highly subjective and is difficult to measure accurately
6851033 women in this study were interviewed after breast cancer was diagnosed when they may be more likely to recall feeling depression and anxiety
6851034 the researchers also didnt account for other factors known to affect breast cancer risk such as family history or weight
6851035 die durchschnittsnote an den gymnasien liegt bei 2 59 an den gesamtschulen liegt sie bei 2 87

6851050 the sussex county ymca is constantly working towards adding programs and opportunities to better serve its members and add value to their membership
6851051 the opportunity to have a playground built at the ymca not only gives the members a place for their children to play but it reaches out to the community to offer a safe environment for children to have fun the sussex county ymca looks forward to creating healthier happier kids and a stronger more united community through the power of play

6851054 thirty five million eligible women didnt vote in the 2004 presidential election and it is my hope that this event will help shine a spotlight on this statistic and inspire women to get involved voting is so important to me and my family who were involved in the civil rights movement it is really an honor to work with lifetime and rock the vote to make sure that every woman does count this election
6851055 i am so honored to participate in the every woman counts party with lifetime and rock the vote it is imperative that we never take for granted our rights as american citizens to vote we must remember that our voices do matter

6851135 ddot is concerned that improving the 14th street bridge will further increase through traffic in the city
6851136 if there is relatively little through traffic along that stretch of i 395 then the concern that ddot has about closing the road is moot if on the other hand we were to show a very high percentage of traffic is coming through then we will look at the closure

6851190 the fact is that the cross isnt a form of cosmic child abuse a vengeful father punishing his son for an offence he has not even committed
6851191 the penal theory posits a conflict between father and son the angry father did not pay the price of sin himself but sent his son to do his dirty work for him so that he could be convinced to forgive us when he otherwise refused to do so
6851192 if you want to be among those specifically qualified to escape being forever punished for your sins in hell you must repent of your individual sins and believe that my father punished me on the cross so he wont have to punish you in hell only if you believe this will you go to heaven when the earth is destroyed and everyone else is banished to hell
6851193 i have been sent by god with this good news that god loves humanity even in its lostness and sin god graciously invites everyone and anyone to turn from his or her current path and follow a new way trust me and become my disciple and you will be transformed and you will participate in the transformation of the world which is possible beginning right now
6851194 after declaring a theme of substitutionary sacrifice in second isaiah pp 77 83 bart goes on to explain there is one particularly important implication for our study the classical view of the relationship of sin and suffering is not simply found throughout the pages of the hebrew bible it is central to the understanding of the new testament as well why is it that jesus had to suffer and die because god has to punish sin second isaiah provided the early christians with a scheme for understanding jesus horrible passion and death this was suffering undertaken for the sake of others it was through the death of jesus that others could be made right with god jesus was in fact a sacrifice for sin p 84 and yet bart rejects the biblical message the evangelical theology i had once held was built on views of suffering christ suffered for my sins so that i would not have to suffer eternally because god is a righteous judge who punishes for all time those who reject him and the salvation that he has provided the irony i suppose is that it was precisely my view of suffering that led me away from this understanding of christ salvation and god i came to think that there is not a god who is actively involved with this world of pain and misery if he is why doesnt he do something about it concomitantly i came to believe that there is not a god who is intent on roasting innocent children and others in hell because they didnt happen to accept a certain religious creed
6851195 as a result the greek perspective has come to inform christian thought about everything from god and jesus to sin and salvation for the last seventeen hundred years in other words the theology that guides the present day church is in many ways a version of faith customized for the fifth century greco romans and when that view was set in stone as the inarguable unchanging only way to explain faith it created all kinds of trouble for those of us living today p 45 the good news of christianity is that we are integrated with god not separated from god p 90 i had never felt separated from god p 97 so it was really hard to make sense of this image of god on one side of a canyon and me supposedly on the other the chasm itself was strange enough but what was truly irreconcilable about this version was why god would be so stymied by the chasm i understood that this was supposed to be a metaphor but it sure didnt seem like a metaphor to the people leading me throughout the booklet they talked about it literally and in any case it had an obvious effect on their notion of god they described a god who while loving me deeply was distant was hard to please and needed to be appeased in order to participate in my life they talked as though there truly was a gaping physical canyon between god and me and there was nothing either of us could do about it other than following the prescribed solution all i could think was what an odd way to talk about the creator of the universe trapped on the far side of a canyon maybe this image isnt troubling to others and maybe it wouldnt have been troubling to me if i hadnt come to the christian story with a story of my own maybe it wouldnt have bothered me if it hadnt been so different from the play id seen but im not sure i would have been interested in the christian faith if the story on the stage had been about a removed god who needed to be placated with a blood offering before he was willing to cross the chasm and participate with humanity p 98 99 in this view god is not a softy but rather a hard nosed immovable infallible judge who cannot abide defiance of the law and boy did we defy it when adam and eve broke gods law in the garden they offended and angered god so heinous was their crime that their punishment extended to all of humanity for all time the antidote to this situation is the crucifixion of the incarnate son of god because only the suffering and death of an equally infinite and infallible being could ever satisfy the infinite offense of the infinitely dishonored god and assuage his wrath yikes even when someone uses a variation of the judicial model the situation is the same the judicial model of sin puts the law at the center of the story in doing so love grace mercy compassion goodness and even god become minor players that must be subject to the law the gospel itself becomes less about god and more about the sin problem
6851196 all the prophets did foresee in spirit that christ should become the greatest transgressor murderer thief rebel blasphemer etc that ever was or could be in all the world
6851197 if ever there should come a wretched day when all our pulpits shall be full of modern thought and the old doctrine of a substitutionary sacrifice shall be exploded then will there remain no word of comfort for the guilty or hope for the despairing hushed will be for ever those silver notes which now console the living and cheer the dying a dumb spirit will possess this sullen world and no voice of joy will break the blank silence of despair the gospel speaks through the propitiation for sin and if that be denied it speaketh no more those who preach not the atonement exhibit a dumb and dummy gospel a mouth it hath but speaketh not they that make it are like unto their idol would you have me silence the doctrine of the blood of sprinkling would any one of you attempt so horrible a deed shall we be censured if we continually proclaim the heaven sent message of the blood of jesus shall we speak with bated breath because some affected person shudders at the sound of the word blood or some cultured individual rebels at the old fashioned thought of sacrifice nay verily we will sooner have our tongue cut out than cease to speak of the precious blood of jesus christ
6851198 penal substitution indicates that the messiah died in the sinners place and took upon himself the sinners just punishment the idea of vicarious penal substitution is imbedded in the warp and woof of scripture
6851199 there was only one hope for me that the infinite wisdom of god might make a way for the love of god to satisfy the wrath of god so that i might become the son of god i thank you heavenly father with all my heart that you saved me from your wrath i rejoice to measure your love for me by the magnitude of the wrath i deserved and the wonder of your mercy by putting christ in my place
6851200 jesus did not wrestle his angry father to the floor of heaven and take the whip out of his hand
6851201 purpose and grace which he gave us in christ jesus before the ages began
6851202 i once published a book of exposition of isaiah 52 13 53 12 fruit of several years of teaching exegesis of the hebrew text
6851203 the fact that christians celebrate the murder of jesus as
6851204 while the atonement accomplished by christ cannot be reduced to this understanding alone and no one should claim that it should to deny or confuse this doctrine is to deny that christ died on the cross for our sins and as our substitute in other words we honestly believe that those who deny dismiss and disparage this doctrine do injury to the gospel
6851205 as i grow old i want to tell everyone who will listen
6851206 i am so thankful for the penal substitutionary death of christ no hope without it
6851207 it carries several major implications for our understanding of salvation 1 the penal substitution theory confirms the biblical teaching of the total depravity of all humans 2 gods nature is not one sided nor is there any tension between its different aspects i e righteous and demanding versus loving and giving 3 there is no other way of salvation but by grace and specifically the death of christ 4 there is security for the believer in his or her relationship to god 5 we must never take lightly the salvation which we have

6851272 todays supreme court decision is yet another stinging rebuke of the bush administrations extreme views on executive power time after time the supreme court has rebuffed the administrations attempts to undermine the constitution from its rasul and hamdi decisions in 2004 to its hamdan decision in 2006 it is a testament to our system of government that the court has rejected the habeas stripping provisions of the military commissions act and reaffirmed that the government does not have the power to detain people indefinitely and arbitrarily without judicial review the writ of habeas corpus provides one of the most significant protections of human freedom against arbitrary government action ever created we can and must fight terrorists without abandoning the principles on which our country was founded
6851273 the constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness you have to catch it yourself

6851290 blackburn rovers are delighted to announce that roque santa cruz has signed a new four year contract with the club running through until 2012
6851291 i dont think any player certainly not those two will be leaving
6851292 as a blackburn fan it would be a tragedy if they left so im sure the club wouldnt allow that
6851293 you could bid 30 million for roque and im sure they wouldnt let him go in my opinion roque is a tremendous player as is benni we are a club that is trying to achieve things ourselves and you couldnt let brad friedel david bentley and roque santa cruz go in the same season theres no way the club will let that happen
6851294 you can see why sometimes premier league managers dont let their players go if they are going to start playing them for 90 minutes
6851295 its always a worry you wonder if youll come back with a half a team im disappointed with some of the managers because they played some of my players for 90 minutes as in andre ooijer roque santa cruz and steven reid
6851296 i spoke to reidy and he feels fine but thats not the point hes had problems with his knees over the years
6851297 morten gamst pedersen played 45 minutes for norway and i havent got a problem with that but when you start playing them for 90 minutes in a friendly i think is absolutely ridiculous
6851298 i can understand it if its a world cup qualifier but not a meaningless friendly when its a friendly i think youve got to show a bit of appreciation
6851299 the league has just started they have had a hard pre season and now ive got six players who have played three games in a week which is unfair
6851300 youve seen it over the years even with the biggest teams that when players go away with their countries they struggle to perform on a saturday and weve got to make sure that doesnt happen to us
6851301 sometimes you can be selfish because they are your players but you have got to show some appreciation for them for the saturday and i think 45 minutes for a friendly is appropriate

6851319 the medicare drug benefit has produced tangible relief for millions of people despite the unusual coverage gap that was created to make the benefit fit within budget constraints but if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions
6851320 development of race based products such as vitamins and drugs
6851321 misleading the public to believe that races are biologically distinct requiring race specific products but the basis for their wares flies in the face of science
6851322 while there are some differences in disease prevalence among races there are no diseases or conditions and certainly no nutritional requirements that are exclusive to just one group
6851323 if weve learned anything from the last decade of genetics research its that our dna is generally colorblind
6851324 as a genetics researcher and someone of mixed heritage myself these companies reflect a troubling trend
6851325 given the wide variation within groups the development of a genetically specific formula would be challenging to say the least
6851326 the recent increase in the numbers of people who identify with more than one race would seem to pose a rather large problem to the companies marketing race based products
6851327 although genetics is involved in most if not all aspects of our health the environment plays at least an equal role
6851328 even if we knew which genes played a part in our dietary needs its unlikely those differences would follow perceived racial divides
6851329 with the administration predicting a record 482 billion deficit for next year president bush and congress should be vigorously pursuing waste and corruption wherever they are likely to be found

6851331 need to start asking medicare officials some hard questions about their operations and their odd notions of auditing
6851332 the country is way too far in debt to keep throwing money at crooks
6851333 publics trust in the program has been repeatedly tested by reports of waste and fraud
6851334 congressional committees will need to sort out how much of this problem is sloppy documentation and how much reflects payment for medical services that should never have been provided and often werent
6851335 congress must also recognize its own failure to give medicare an important tool to combat fraud and waste
6851336 new competitive bidding program for durable medical equipment that would require a more intense look at the qualifications and integrity of the suppliers

6851347 i grew up in the hood in the south in baton rouge and there were crews around all the time dancing so i wanted to try to expose america to that
6851348 we began this because we just felt that the hip hop dance community was not being exposed to a larger audience
6851349 when you look up on the stage you see so many backgrounds
6851350 even though were getting exposed to the dance culture were also watching personal stories
6851351 you want to also look at their stories who are they where are they from
6851352 thats one of the hardest things when youre so tight like that and you have to separate being friends from the competition its just really heartbreaking to do
6851353 last season there were a number of crews who stood on the sidelines watching saying is this for real
6851354 opening up business avenues and a commercialization that dancers have never had before
6851355 expand their dance classes and travel around the country performing

6851419 historically marketing budgets are among the first to be cut in a budget crunch but marketers should be cautious about trying to find a quick fix
6851420 in fact spending more during tough times when competitors may be scaling back is a good way to strategically boost market share because this often helps brands come out ahead when the economy rebounds before rushing to slash marketing spending it is important to carefully evaluate how effective short term budget management can lead to significant long term benefits
6851421 effective marketing spending during economic downturns is not about how much you spend but how you spend it
6851422 marketers must assess how consumers and customer behavior can be positively influenced during tough times if it can then marketers should give increased consideration to more spending rather than cutting

6851428 the transaction would create a diversified specialty pharmaceutical company with greater commercialization capabilities an expanded portfolio of pain management products and a strengthened pipeline which would include multiple platform technologies
6851429 our 33 00 per share all cash proposal provides alpharma stockholders with a substantial cash premium for their investment in the company we are confident that this combination would deliver significant benefits and superior value to our respective stockholders and employees and create a stronger platform to deliver innovation to patients prescribers and customers importantly it would also further diversify kings business with an additional source of steady cash flow from alpharmas animal health division a leading feed additives business in addition a combination with alpharma would deliver significant synergies
6851430 we believe our all cash proposal is too compelling to ignore in light of the fact that the alpharma board declined this proposal we think it is important for the stockholders of both companies to be aware of this exciting opportunity it remains our strong preference to work cooperatively with alpharma regarding this proposal

6851442 while these decisions resulted in a dismantling of the legal foundations of segregated education they often failed to alter significantly the actual racial balance of students attending public schools
6851443 d espite the fact that legal and administrative decisions concerning school desegregation have rested increasingly on quantitative concepts little attention has been directed toward the development of a uniform and rigorous method for measuring school desegregation

6851445 when the racial balance in every school is identical with the racial balance of the school district

6851469 whip blunt and the house republican leadership have made it clear that we will continue to fight to have comprehensive energy reform legislation pass in congress as the democrat leadership continues to ignore the will of the american public
6851470 our nation needs a comprehensive energy plan a plan that incorporates the common sense ideas we saw today
6851471 republicans are committed to an all of the above approach on energy legislation for far too long our national energy policy has viewed our energy resources as an environmental hazard instead of an economic asset and republicans want that to change

6851508 chi ha fatto comunella con mafiosi non usi il suo nome
6851509 ritornato a parlare di giustizia lultima perla di agosto proprio quella dove dice che bisogna riformare la giustizia perch cosi voleva il giudice falcone
6851510 falcone afferma di pietro una persona che ci ha rimesso la vita per fare in modo che la legge fosse uguale per tutti e per combattere la grande criminalit organizzata e soprattutto il connubio la connivenza tra criminalit organizzata e mondo delle istituzioni berlusconi richiamandosi a falcone per parlare di giustizia si comportato come il diavolo che si dichiara allacqua santa per farsi gli interessi propri
6851511 falcone scrive ancora lex pm non era affatto contro lindipendenza della magistratura berlusconi invece vuole che la magistratura dipenda dallesecutivo vuole addirittura che il consiglio superiore della magistratura sia composto da maggiori esponenti laici ossia da persone nominate dalla politica vuole una magistratura sottomessa dalla politica e che quando si tratta di giudicare i politici faccia un passo indietro lesatto contrario di quello che voleva falcone ogni volta che glielo faccio notare lui e i suoi portaborse dicono che di pietro non si deve permettere di utilizzare il nome del giudice falcone ma in verit lui che lo usa
6851512 vorrei dire e ricordare a quelle persone come martelli quel ministro della giustizia condannato con sentenza passata in giudicato nellinchiesta enimont che ha detto in queste ore che di pietro lasci stare falcone perch falcone disprezzava linchiesta di mani pulite e i giudici di milano detto da un condannato nellinchiesta mani pulite ha il valore che ha che falcone aggiunge il leader dellidv allepoca in cui iniziammo mani pulite e prima di essere ammazzato si occupato come direttore generale degli affari penali di gestire la delicata fase delle rogatorie internazionali che per conto della procura di milano venivano trasferite e trasmesse alle varie autorit giudiziarie del mondo in particolare quelle della svizzera le prime rogatorie furono fatte proprio grazie al contributo ai consigli e allinteressamento di falcone carta canta posso produrre documenti
6851513 la persona che ci mise in contatto con il giudice dal ponte la persona che realizz e trasmise le prime rogatorie contro 42 persone che io stesso scrissi racconta ancora di pietro fu proprio giovanni falcone non credo proprio che un giudice che disprezzasse i giudici milanesi e odiasse linchiesta mani pulite facesse parte attiva nel portare avanti le rogatorie degli stessi giudici di milano questa la verit le altre sono quelle di comodo di indagati e condannati che vogliono stravolgere la storia per utilizzare il nome di un eroe per interessi personali
6851514 there is no all out war we are doing this to have all out peace
6851515 we have never deviated from the objectives of the peace process the military campaign we are waging is intended to remove the obstacle to peace
6851516 they rebels have created trouble before and during the proceedings of the peace process and they are the ones we would expect to create problems even after a final peace agreement will be forged
6851517 the president wishes to allay fears that an all out war will be launched by the government in light of increasing calls to do so on one hand and of concerns of others that such a thrust could be possible at this stage of vigorous pursuit operations against rogue elements of the milf
6851518 we are not setting any condition we are just appealing to the leadership of the milf to unite and stop the atrocities being committed by their recalcitrant commanders
6851519 for our country and as a sign of goodwill it will be good if they can surrender the two commanders but if that is not realistic for them to surrender the milf leadership should at least tell them not to undertake any further trouble or violent actions
6851520 our engagements with all armed groups shall be about disarmament demobilization and rehabilitation or ddr from negotiations our focus shall shift to dialogues with the communities or government conducting authentic conversations or dialogue with the people
6851521 you just got it at the wrong context because this is a work in progress she was only referring to the final phase of the negotiations when she mentioned ddr
6851522 the president wishes to stress that the peace process as defined along one of its main principles is not defined nor determined by armed groups alone but by all communities and sectors concerned
6851523 armed rebellion does not have a place in our democracy
6851524 our peace process will make sure that our government will push for a national total rejection of armed struggle as a means to achieve political and societal change
6851525 bda is now being suspected of having diverted huge livelihood grants for the past two years to rebuild the milfs military after having been weakened in the armed conflicts in 2000 and in 2003
6851526 we could only wonder where the milf are getting the money to procure their logistics
6851527 peace advocacy groups are now calling for an in depth review of the funds international donors have given the bda as livelihood assistance for poor muslim communities in areas where the milf has guerrilla camps

6851529 they are still willing to tell the truth and everything they know about what happened in that tarmac on august 21 1983
6851530 they want to claim what little is left of their freedom the truth is all they have left since everything they had were taken away for a crime they did not do
6851531 they believe that its never too late to tell the truth even after 25 years of unjust imprisonment
6851532 i hope there will be change of heart of the family of ninoy
6851533 we have to understand that these soldiers owe the filipino people the truth behind the case and the aquino family is not the filipino people

6851550 i feel as though i am rambling at this point and digging a hole from which there is no recovery
6851551 im happy about it but this is just a part of the goal the next goal is to repeat this and so just keep up the concentration all the time
6851552 first of all i dont think lewis needs any help
6851553 he has shown himself that he can do the job and that he doesnt need anyone the second point is that i am trying to do the maximum for myself and i am not helping any other drivers
6851554 in the past it has been very clear that at mclaren they have had the policy of equal drivers and both have the same opportunities
6851555 i have the same car the same opportunity and i am just working towards improving the pace and the results
6851556 from the all american game to the time we got here over the summer we ve all just been really close i don t think any other class has had the opportunity to be like that the irish had 14 pledges playing in the army all american game down in san antonio in january and the group became close maybe even too close when we were in san antonio a lot of us were so close and we all hung out and things like that i was telling everybody else we need to start meeting new people we need to hang out with other people we re going to be together for the next four years of our lives joked newman lewis moore was the last guy to jump on board and admitted that since he didn t get to know all of the guys that well he was a little hesitant to believe it when i first was getting recruited by notre dame i really didn t know the other guys i didn t play in the army all american game coach ianello was the one that was recruiting me and he was just telling me about how this class was real special everybody likes everybody and you re not going to be the only one away from home and stuff like that because that was one of my biggest fears being away from home lewis moore said when i came up for my official visit joe fauria he was with me the first minute i stepped on campus we just kind of instantly bonded and were just real cool from the start when we were up here he was just telling me how the whole class was real cool and everybody s cool with everybody at first i was a little hesitant because i was like it sounds too good to be true but after i committed and signed and everything i came here for the spring game and it just kind of showed how everybody was now that lewis moore has been around the group more he sees it everyday we re always hanging out with each other if we do something we re usually going in groups of four or five eating at the dining hall almost everyday together he said we re just helping each other out with homework and everything like that so it s just real cool mcdonald said that the entire group is like that we all know each other pretty well we all get along really well i don t think there is one person that sticks out as an outcast mcdonald said we have a really close bond in this class and i think as a whole team too here we all get along with the upperclassmen pretty well too

6851565 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6851566 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6851567 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6851568 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6851569 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6851570 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6851571 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6851572 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

6851577 the point of view of one of plames inside contacts upon discovering her true identity
6851578 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6851579 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6851580 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6851581 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6851582 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6851583 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6851584 if we dont receive sufficient time to prepare a competitive proposal theres really little option for us than to no bid in this competition
6851585 we think we can meet these requirements if given the time to put together a proposal
6851586 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6851587 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6851588 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6851589 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6851590 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6851591 listen youve been here two years we want you to be here forever well buy out your commission and raise your salary so you wont lose any income in return youll get stability do you think youre going to have a good year im willing to guarantee that youll have a good year and if you really do have a good year ill guarantee that next year will be even better then again if the economy goes bad and you have some down years you dont have to worry about a big drop in your income youll continue to earn your salary we want to give you that security because we want you to be here for the long haul
6851592 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6851593 are you the one who is coming or should we look for someone else
6851594 go back and tell john what you hear and see
6851595 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6851596 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6851597 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6851598 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6851599 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6851600 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6851601 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6851602 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6851603 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6851604 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6851605 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6851606 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6851607 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6851608 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6851609 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6851610 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6851611 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6851612 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6851613 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6851614 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6851615 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6851616 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6851617 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6851618 no one can give a full guarantee a person will not break down if she is away from family or being abused by her employer no one is exempt to have a break down if you are in a hostile environment
6851619 its the government officials that should undergo psychiatric tests i dont think they consulted psychiatrists about their bright idea
6851620 the department of foreign affairs should realize that deplorable working conditions overseas verbal physical emotional and sexual abuse torture and non payment of wages are major factors that drive ofws to the brink of insanity
6851621 it is the dfa and definitely not the ofws who should have their heads examined if they really believe mandatory psychiatric tests could help prevent ofws from snapping in the workplace
6851622 it is such a shame that those who are directly responsible for pushing migrants rights are the ones who are blind and deaf to the real issues ofws face

6851625 the instant pinakbet mix would soon be marketed to us europe middle east and asia
6851626 the mfc would be the first to export the product
6851627 in developing the product fnri had in mind busy homemakers as well as career women here and abroad who are always on the rush having little time to go to the market prepare and cook their favorite dishes
6851628 the shelf life of the product is up to one year allowing it to be distributed to more and bigger markets abroad
6851629 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6851630 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6851631 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6851632 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6851633 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6851634 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6851635 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6851636 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6851637 who are open to doing something on the production side
6851638 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6851639 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6851640 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6851641 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6851642 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6851643 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6851644 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6851645 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6851646 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6851647 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6851648 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6851649 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6851650 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6851651 we understand that user groups are often sponsor funded and may lack the resources to maintain an enhanced community site
6851652 for this reason we have been sponsoring user groups around the world by offering free sharepoint hosting for their site sponsoring member meetings and providing giveaway prizes
6851653 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6851654 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6851655 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6851656 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6851657 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6851658 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6851659 we are pleased to again be recognized as one of the fastest growing companies in america
6851660 having achieved the first major milestone as a technology start up by proving that we have a viable product and business model we are proud to now be recognized as one of the fastest growing companies in the country
6851661 our second annual inc 5000 continues the most ambitious project in business journalism
6851662 the inc 5000 gives an unrivalled portrait of young underreported companies across all industries doing fascinating things with cutting edge business models as well as older companies that are still showing impressive growth

6851675 das rennen hier ist kein langstreckenrennen mehr die strategie hat keine bedeutung normalerweise sind die fahrerwechsel nicht so wichtig aber hier schon wir sind da einfach langsamer als die anderen vor allem weil ryan und ich unterschiedlich gro sind und wegen der architektur des autos
6851676 die hitze ist im aston martin nicht so tragisch aber ich bin auch nur 25 minuten drin gesessen hier wird aber sowieso keiner einen l ngeren stint als 30 minuten fahren also erwarte ich da keine schwierigkeiten aber mir sind trotzdem die zwei stunden rennen lieber

6851679 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6851680 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6851681 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6851682 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

6851686 its very clear to us this is a new competition
6851687 clearly the requirements have changed and the defense department is essentially asking for a different kind of plane from the first competition
6851688 the pentagon is quite mindful that congress is more likely to go to bat for boeing if this becomes a sole source contract
6851689 if we dont receive sufficient time to prepare a competitive proposal theres really little option for us than to no bid in this competition
6851690 we think we can meet these requirements if given the time to put together a proposal
6851691 i cant imagine boeing losing anything from taking this approach
6851692 so have you and gar set a date for the wedding
6851693 gar isnt religious and thinks itd be hypocritical to take his vows before a god or goddess he doesnt worship
6851694 me either its one of things i love about him
6851695 they wouldnt make love without our permission but thuria doesnt like sleeping alone she likes someone to be close to it makes her feel safe
6851696 you know i must admit that if we werent in their lives theyd make a great couple
6851697 would still be napping if it werent for the smell of that vile muck you drink
6851698 so whatd you do today figure out how to turn lead into gold
6851699 actually she was helping me with a summoning circle i think you two are ready to start learning the art of conjuring
6851700 cool so whatd you call up some huge drooling demon with twelve arms
6851701 i was analysing the dynamics of the circle and the spell itself senjo aided me
6851702 if you must know we went shopping for your wedding ring today
6851703 like garadun says it would spoil the surprise youll have to wait till you get married
6851704 ive got like a couple dozen of those things scattered all over the flat
6851705 you are without a doubt the cruellest man in history
6851706 hey i have to make sure youre surprised dont i
6851707 fine you really want to see the ring i can get it for you if you want it only take a minute
6851708 thats all right im sorry for making such a fuss
6851709 why did it bug you so much you normally have such a great sense of humour kitten i thought youd have fun and instead i upset you why
6851710 did you think there really wasnt a ring is that it
6851711 senjo were you thinking that if there was no ring then i didnt want to marry you
6851712 youre the best thing thats ever happened to me i love you so much i cant describe it i want you to be my wife senjo and i want to be the best possible husband i can to you
6851713 its just that a girl gets doubts and im sorry
6851714 i had this huge emptiness inside me and you filled it i cant imagine life without you
6851715 does she make me hard with only a touch does she make my blood burn with only a kiss no you do i want you all the time kitten i cant get enough of you
6851716 with staying inside so often its given us the chance to really improve our knowledge and abilities
6851717 you two are such suck ups but thanks really youve made my job very easy and so far the council hasnt had cause for complaint still im looking forward to the end of all this cold weather
6851718 we get to stay inside and snuggle by the fire and make love a lot its very cosy and we get to wear our furs all the time and i really love my furs but spring will be nice too my special time
6851719 yes the first couple of weeks in spring is the only time when im fertile
6851720 uh darling you know we cant have a baby together
6851721 i know but if youd like a baby garadun could be the father
6851722 hey hang on i aint fathering no child no way
6851723 mainly because i dont like kids it was one of the first things i discussed with senjo i dont want kids
6851724 humans and animal people cant interbreed but i dont want a child either im happy with only us
6851725 being a mother and being a wizard arent compatible lover
6851726 and like senjo im happy just having you in my life are you disappointed
6851727 but i do have to tell you that come mating season i get well a little different
6851728 i want to make love all the time and its very hard to resist me
6851729 something in my natural perfume gets to you whoevers around me ill want them and go after them especially garadun
6851730 youre a human male you can get me pregnant its instinctive
6851731 guess we grab a room in an inn for a couple weeks come spring huh beautiful
6851732 but one thing you could do is hire some concubines to help make love to me some other nymph owners do that
6851733 but all this talk of non stop lovemakings got me excited
6851734 why dont you give me a preview of what to expect
6851735 aside from her boinking me to death the last thing i need is to help make a kid
6851736 thuria thinks youre lovely as you are so do i and gar too
6851737 i know but i need to shake myself up a bit
6851738 ive had my hair like this for years look at thuria silky black hair that falls past her rear its gorgeous then theres you that beautiful mass of black waves all down your back my hair seems flat compared to you two so time for a change a new look
6851739 maybe but id like to stand out even a little bit
6851740 a few more moments and youll be a new woman
6851741 this emphasises your lovely cheekbones and shows off your elegant neck
6851742 i wonder what thuria and gar will think when they see it
6851743 cera has a surprise for you and she wants to show you properly now close your eyes
6851744 yup this is seriously nice mind if i ask why
6851745 i needed a change but im glad you like it
6851746 it will take some getting used to but i like it very very much
6851747 but she proved me wrong the hairdresser did a wonderful job ceras got a whole new look
6851748 me gods no i like mine long and i know you do too
6851749 that glorious mane of yours is your pride and joy i know that you stay as you are
6851750 thank you i like it the way it is too
6851751 why dont we go out and celebrate ceras new look you know show it off to the masses we can get dressed up and go out to dinner maybe take in a play
6851752 we havent been out somewhere special in a long time
6851753 i agree a night on the town is what we need
6851754 well put on our finery and show hylastria the two finest couples in the city
6851755 sure its an inside joke but were on vacation and someone has to tell him that
6851756 for the republicans its going to get worse before it gets better
6851757 i think they will take a pretty severe beating in this election
6851758 i think the republican party is in the midst of a wrenching but important transition from the reagan bush era into whatever comes next
6851759 when it comes to the issue of fiscal responsibility id be the first to admit that i think some of my colleagues lost their way
6851760 getting our party to stand on principle is a critical part of what we have to do in order to earn our way back
6851761 the republicans difficulty is they have a small government philosophy and they use the rhetoric of limited government but when they become the majority party its very difficult to hold to that philosophy
6851762 the republican party is going to undergo a fairly extended fight for its new identity
6851763 there are going to be contentions between the social conservatives and the libertarian wings of the party and between the fiscal conservative and economic growth wings of the party
6851764 and the first six months of 2007 may turn out in retrospect to be the bottoming out point of the republican party as an institution the 2006 elections were a tremendous wake up call
6851765 a broadly center right party that achieves the goals of the american people
6851766 me alegra mucho estar nuevamente con ustedes los atletas que han merecidamente conquistado el honor de llevar la bandera nacional a la competencia deportiva m s importante del mundo
6851767 me llena de satisfacci n el nombrarles representantes de m xico en los juegos paral mpicos beijing 2008 y sabemos muy bien que pondr n muy en alto el nombre de m xico
6851768 hace poco menos de un a o me reun con ustedes para celebrar los grandes triunfos que le dieron a m xico en los juegos parapanamericanos en r o de janeiro conf o en que su participaci n en la paraolimpiada va a ser igualmente exitosa
6851769 nuestros mejores representantes deportivos porque cubren a m xico de gloria y dar como los grandes atletas que son todo de s en la competencia
6851770 admiramos su capacidad para superar la adversidad para poner siempre la mirada sobre el nuevo reto y alcanzar nuevos triunfos
6851771 como dijo bien juan ignacio reyes de nataci n sa es la actitud que necesitamos para construir el m xico que necesitamos un m xico ganador y de ganadores una visi n que inspira nuestro compromiso con ustedes y nuestra responsabilidad con el bien com n de los mexicanos
6851772 por eso el gobierno federal est y estar con ustedes con miras a su participaci n ol mpica hemos apoyado a su esfuerzo respondimos a una demanda justa de nuestros deportistas paral mpicos al crear por primera vez en la historia un programa de becas especial para ustedes
6851773 hemos apoyado con casi 30 millones de pesos para el entrenamiento de nuestros atletas para estos juegos paral mpicos
6851774 s bien que adem s de destinar recursos hay muchas tareas que debemos atender s que se necesita dar mucho mayor apoyo al deporte en todas su reas
6851775 se necesita mayor promoci n para que podamos detectar talentos mayor difusi n para que la gente practique m s el deporte requerimos m s infraestructura para que m s mexicanos practiquen el deporte de manera cotidiana
6851776 mientras los mexicanos no hagamos del deporte una pr ctica cotidiana no podremos alcanzar los lugares que m xico merece por el tama o de su poblaci n y la juventud de su gente
6851777 una manera de combatir la inseguridad es precisamente rescatando espacios p blicos y abriendo oportunidades para el deporte para los j venes abriendo alternativas para la pr ctica del deporte como un sano esparcimiento como un instrumento de disciplina personal y de formaci n f sica y espiritual adecuada
6851778 para lo cual tenemos que ampliar de manera decidida las capacidades para la pr ctica del deporte en las escuelas los barrios y rancher as por razones de desarrollo personal y humano por razones de seguridad de saludad tendremos que hacer del deporte en m xico una pr ctica cotidiana accesible para todos
6851779 precisamente es as como combatimos no s lo a trav s de la persecuci n de los delincuentes sino tambi n a trav s del combate a las causas sociales de estos problemas que queremos superar
6851780 estoy seguro que juntos podemos transformar a m xico en un pa s m s ordenado justo y seguro con la participaci n activa de todos los mexicanos
6851781 sabemos que ustedes pondr n muy en alto el nombre de m xico sabemos que ondear la bandera nacional y que con ustedes entonaremos nuestro himno cuando su esfuerzo sea coronado con el xito con el triunfo

6851854 a shift of such magnitude can only happen by developing and implementing breakthrough biomeasurement bioinformatics biologically based and health information technologies that can be integrated with current efforts to improve health care delivery
6851855 before these technologies can be realized and commercialized however a long term economic health care strategy must be established with clear metrics for measuring and determining the value of emerging bio and information technologies
6851856 creating this strategy will facilitate proper allocation of financial resources and ensure a focus on implementing the most promising technologies

6851861 tough budgetary decisions must be made now in order to ensure a financially healthy agency next fiscal year

6851863 we owe it to the memory of our four colleagues to carry on
6851864 no es un circuito urbano al uso tiene algo m s
6851865 sensaciones nuevas y emocionantes diferentes a las de cualquier otro circuito
6851866 me gusta el ltimo sector hay varias frenadas con inercia lateral en las que te mueves del asiento dentro del habit culo son sensaciones que no se dan en ning n otro sitio
6851867 el coche cambia por completo con o sin gasolina y factores decisivos como la adherencia o la estabilidad en las frenadas se modifican enormemente la confianza en los frenos ser fundamental en la clasificaci n es muy dif cil hacer una vuelta perfecta
6851868 cada vez que hemos entrado en pista hab a m s goma en el asfalto y m s grip que en la anterior
6851869 estos primeros d as de competici n en un circuito nuevo son complicados para todos la pista es buena aunque hay que encontrar los puntos clave cuanto antes hay sectores en los que hay que estar muy concentrado este no es un circuito urbano al uso sino que tiene algo m s
6851870 estamos evolucionando carrera tras carrera creo que actualmente estamos en disposici n de estar entre los seis primeros en la clasificaci n y mantenernos en los puntos en la carrera la victoria creo que es imposible pero espero que este fin de semana suponga un paso adelante para nosotros
6851871 no podemos olvidar que cuando empec a ganar ninguna televisi n nacional daba en directo las carreras mientras que ahora incluso se retransmiten los tests de invierno ha habido un gran cambio en todo el pa s yo estoy en medio de todo esto y estoy feliz
6851872 no creo que sea una zona conflictiva ni peligrosa porque si te mantienes a la derecha hay buen acceso al pit lane adem s los veh culos que vayan por delante de ti tienen espacio para frenar un poco m s tarde de modo que no molestan hoy he pisado la l nea y he cometido un error
6851873 no hay nada no he estado hablando con nadie ya que no es el momento para eso ahora mismo estoy concentrado al m ximo en la presente temporada
6851874 bastante sucio cuando te sales de la l nea de carrera por lo que adelantar ser una maniobra arriesgada
6851875 nosotros no hemos hablado con el betis nada man es jugador del almer a y no tenemos ninguna otra noticia aqu no ha venido nadie del betis ma ana jugamos un partido contra ellos pero no hemos hablado nada del jugador
6851876 de significativo nada el entrenador pone a los jugadores que l cree que est n mejor para jugar y ahora ha elegido a otro futbolista y ya est nosotros no le hemos dicho a gonzalo nada acerca de que juegue man o de que no juegue sino que simplemente l alinea a los que estima que son mejores para este partido pero no hay ninguna cosa por parte del club en el sentido de que juegue o deje de jugar
6851877 nosotros hasta ahora no tenemos ninguna otra novedad y por lo tanto no podemos decir mucho m s

6851939 foreigners are selling out bonds which is seen from bigger spreads and stocks which is clear from declining benchmarks
6851940 while many investors were plainly shocked by the escalation of the conflict with georgia we think that those bold enough to increase their russia exposure at this time of perceived elevated political risk may be rewarded
6851941 although volatility can be unwelcome in the short term it is precisely at times such as this that active managers can take advantage of market inefficiencies

6851948 when you have 40 000 odd people on the playa and driving art cars it breaks that crust and youre liberating a pretty large source of dust
6851949 theres a resetting that can occur with winter as it comes along and leaves a film of moisture

6851968 the gesture will not make hamas more flexible about its demands because the organization sees that israel is releasing prisoners with blood on their hands which merely causes hamas to harden its position
6851969 hamas is looking despairingly at how despite the fact that it holds shalit it is not succeeding in bringing about a prisoner release while abu mazen abbas who is conducting negotiations with israel is securing a prisoner release
6851970 its enough to see hamas response to the governments decision to understand the pressure the organization is under

6852107 you always get the feeling thats hes thinking on another level a different level
6852108 its been a really great tournament ive been having this medal in my head for a very long time
6852109 actually its an experiment for me whether thoughts and feelings really can manifest its important to visualize i think nothing can happen unless you have visualized it at some time it doesnt come by chance
6852110 its not so much a matter of believing in the regular sense of the word its more of enjoying the possibility of it actually existing
6852111 and it doesnt matter whether somebody judges you or not for having that possibility in your mind because its a funny possibility and it enlightens your life and makes it more colorful

6852134 its a huge part of my life its tough to think beyond that but at some point im going to have to
6852135 i have some stuff going through my head but its going to stay there
6852136 its been an intense and hard couple of years and i think i need some time before i take the next step
6852137 its hard because i dont know whats going to come in my life when im going to start a family and all those things
6852138 obviously my husband and i are starting to think about the future and everything
6852139 probably since they were children theyve been known as the elite athlete and thats who they are at family barbecues
6852140 the goal will be to understand for themselves who they are now and celebrate the elite athlete part of their identity but also adding to it or shifting a little bit and more importantly communicating that to other people because networking accounts for probably 80 per cent of jobs people get
6852141 your coach tells you what to do when to wake up what you should be eating
6852142 its not easy but its easy in that you dont have to think for yourself very much and then youre out on your own you dont know how to apply your skills at all
6852143 i dove in a pool where i saw people go to the olympics and then become lifeguards and i thought that is not going to be me
6852144 i can tell you ive struggled with that transition quite a bit in the last couple of years
6852145 swimming has been such a huge part of my life i was pretty good at that i guess theres always the fear am i ever going to be that good at anything else again
6852146 i stayed in the sport longer than a lot of people so now at 35 to still be struggling and trying to figure out what you want to be when you grow up you feel like a bit of a flake
6852147 it makes it easy to learn some of the circus acrobatics because of your background in sports
6852148 most employers are going to look at these athletes and be fascinated with their careers and their whole interview might be about what was it like to be at the olympics so the person might not be given a chance to demonstrate theyre fit for that occupation
6852149 the key for the athlete is to use that employers language whatever field theyre going into
6852150 we believe these athletes come with a set of skills that nobody else has in terms of hard work and commitment
6852151 at the same time theyve had years having someone tell them what to eat when to get up and what their training schedule is some of their skills are very transferable and with others they need help
6852152 i dont know why i dont get more calls i should

6852154 whether he will have the political courage to really sell it
6852155 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
6852156 and i also feel that americans want us to work together you know former pennsylvania gov tom ridge r is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
6852157 that does not mean we exclude people from our party who are pro choice
6852158 picks a pro choice running mate its not going to be pretty
6852159 effectively destroy ing the republican party and push ing the conservative movement to the bleachers
6852160 the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting
6852161 was not the bill that was presented at the state level what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe v wade

6852165 was moving to quash only a narrow and innocuous definitional bill identical to federal law
6852166 i can tell you the sponsors always wanted the entire package of bills which were introduced together and analyzed together
6852167 they never wanted them separated because they wanted to make sure that physicians would be chilled into not performing abortions for fear of going to jail

6852177 but there are a lot of young people who have a taste of western food from travelling or going to school abroad and they come back home looking for it
6852178 because i was stuck here and i wanted to eat western food there was no place other than the hotels and i had to cook at home a lot
6852179 basically westerners were just being gouged and i thought beijing needed a diner and i was going to give them one
6852180 our breakfasts are number 1 to do a real western breakfast youve got to know what youre doing to do it well
6852181 there are other western restaurants but they havent captured how to get the flavour of real western food it may look the same but it wont taste the same and most people cant stomach a chinese breakfast
6852182 its hard enough to open up a restaurant anywhere but back in canada i can speak the language and know where to find the products
6852183 but in beijing it feels like its 10 times more difficult the source of ingredients has been one of our biggest challenges and staffing has always been difficult
6852184 the city is changing so fast i think that food is part of the change too
6852185 a few people speak some english a few people speak a little bit of japanese so its just like playing charades or pictionary

6852211 given the epidemic of obesity in the u s and the frequent use of statins the positive association we observed raises substantial concern as to the safety of these widely prescribed agents
6852212 we also found no evidence that use of a statin was associated with risk of developing more aggressive subtypes of prostate caner
6852213 overall we found no support for the current hypothesis that statin use may reduce risk of prostate cancer
6852214 current use of a statin was associated with a 50 percent increase in risk of prostate cancer and use for 5 or more years was associated with an 80 percent increase in risk of the disease both of these risk estimates were statistically significant

6852240 global steel prices are softening and if the trend continues it calls for a reduction in domestic prices
6852241 in the last four six weeks global prices have softened by around 100 150 a tonne
6852242 if we are not allowed to increase prices when international prices go up is it fair to tell us to cut prices when international prices come down but if imports become cheaper we will have no options

6852246 we have already acquired the land and are in the process of constructing the plant we are also prepared to meet supplies as per the schedule whether we will move out from singur or not will depend on what mr ratan tata says as they are our customers we will go wherever they ask us to supply from

6852254 many of the most puzzling and seemingly arbitrary turns of psychoanalytic theory involving propositions that are false to the extent that they are testable at all are either hidden biological assumptions or result directly from such assumptions which freud learned from his teachers in medical school

6852279 oh the innocence of it what about the millions of facts that show that men deliberately and in full knowledge of what their real interests were spurned them and rushed in a different direction doesnt this suggest that stubbornness and willfulness were stronger in these people than their interests
6852280 and what would the natural illogical fruit of heightened consciousness be if not inertia by which i mean consciously sitting with folded arms spontaneous people and men of action can act precisely because they are limited and stupid
6852281 and so in the end ladies and gentlemen its best to do nothing at all conscious inertia is the best
6852282 i couldnt even conceive of being second best thats why in real life i resigned myself so easily to being last a hero couldnt be altogether defiled by mud so why not wallow in it
6852283 no argument about that reason as a good thing but reason is only reason and it only satisfies mans rational requirements desire on the other hand is the manifestation of life and it encompasses everything from reason down to scratching oneself and although when were guided by our desires life may often turn into a messy affair its still life and not a series of extractions of square roots
6852284 the archetypes are the numinous structural elements of the psyche and possess a certain autonomy and specific energy which enables them to attract out of the conscious mind those contents which are best suited to themselves

6852286 in these myths the mother is not one she is dual she has two aspects in her light aspect she is compassionate filled with maternal love and pity and in her dark aspect she is fierce and terrible and will not tolerate childish dependence

6852288 i have frequently seen people become neurotic when they content themselves with inadequate or wrong answers to the questions of life they seek position marriage reputation outward success or money and remain unhappy neurotic even when they have attained what they were seeking such people are usually confined within too narrow a spiritual horizon their life has not sufficient content sufficient meaning if they are enabled to develop into more spacious personalities the neurosis generally disappears
6852289 a short episode between two great mysteries which yet are one
6852290 when the pain is so intense that it no longer has access to the level of consciousness when the thoughts are so dispersed that they are no longer understood by fellow men when the most vital contacts with the world are cut off even then the spirit of man does not succumb and the urge to create may persist the search the appeal the anguish the revolt the wish may all be there and can be recognized in the fog of the emotional storm of the schizophrenic patient and within the crumbling of his cognitive structures
6852291 gods we project them first in audacious images which constricting fate destroys for us again but they are the immortals who in the end will hear us
6852292 when you are in the darkness you take the next thing and that is the dream and you can be sure that the dream is your nearest friend the dream is the friend of those who are not guided anymore by the traditional truth and in consequence are isolated
6852293 the question is not religion or not but which kind of religion whether it is one furthering mans development the unfolding of his specifically human powers or one paralyzing them we can interpret neurosis as a private form of religion more specifically as a regression to primitive forms of religion conflicting with officially recognized patterns of religious thought
6852294 i am unworthy and can only contract relationships in which that unworthiness is reiterated
6852295 in the quietest night with whispers of tenderness and trust penetrating the senses control power anger are thrown aside and we bear witness to the only valid instant in the universe love
6852296 you shouldnt fight a neurosis to get rid of it it is probably the one thing that is necessary for you to learn what is the matter it is therefore the gift of god
6852297 remember youve come here having already understood the necessity of struggling with yourself only with yourself therefore thank everyone who gives you the opportunity
6852298 i am my dialogue with the angels the messengers of mystery
6852299 looking in will require of us great subtlety and great courage nothing less than a complete shift in our attitude to life and to the mind we are so addicted to looking outside ourselves that we have lost access to our inner being almost completely we are terrified to look inward because our culture has given us no idea of what we will find we may even think that if we do we will be in danger of madness this is one of the last and most resourceful ploys of the ego to prevent us from discovering our real nature
6852300 matriarchy is bound up with matter and a religious stage of development that acknowledges only corporeal life the triumph of paternity brings with it the liberation of the spirit from the manifestations of nature a sublimation of human existence over the laws of material life while the principle of motherhood is common to all spheres of tellurian life man by the preponderant position he accords to the begetting potency emerges from this relationship and becomes conscious of his higher calling spiritual life rises over corporeal existence and the relationship with the lower spheres of existence and the relationship with the lower spheres of existence is restricted to the physical aspect maternity pertains to the physical side of man the only thing he shares with animals the paternal spiritual principle belongs to him alone here he breaks through the bonds of tellurism and lifts his eyes to the higher regions of the cosmos
6852301 in the former we have confinement to matter in the latter we have intellectual and spiritual development in the former we have unconscious lawfulness in the latter individualism in the former we find abandonment to nature in the latter we find exaltation above nature a breaking of the old barriers and painful strivings of promethean life replacing the constant rest peaceful pleasure and eternal infantilism in an ageing body the mothers free giving is the exalted hope of the demeter mystery which is perceived in the fate of the grain seed hellenic man on the contrary wants to win everything even the most exalted heights on his own in struggle he becomes aware of his fatherly nature and raises himself above materialism to which he had once completely belonged and struggles towards his own divinization no longer does he look for the spring of immortality in the child bearing woman now he looks for it in the male creative principle on which he bestows the divinity that was once accorded only to motherhood
6852302 individual psychology to be sure is concerned with the individual human being and it examines the ways in which he tries to satisfy his instinctual drives but only rarely and under specific exceptional circumstances is it in a position to abstract from this persons relationship with other individuals in the individuals psychic life other people ordinarily must be considered as either models objects helpers or opponents thus from the beginning individual psychology is simultaneously social psychology in this extended but legitimate sense

6852310 a time of 38 66 in any other given day is a pretty good time but not in an olympic final so we got some work to do but this team will be back
6852311 this was hands down a fantastic event and the promoter hopes to make it the biggest stage race in the area bob roll wants to help him do that the event doubled in size from last year and i think itd be one to really encourage all of mabra to get up to beautiful area awesome courses amazing support from the town the locals were there to give us free homemade cookies turkey wraps bottled water fruit granola after every race some locals on the board of business development even approached us in a restaurant to ask what teams we rode for and to have us explain some of the racing rules etc and to ask what more they as a town could do to improve the weekend
6852312 as if people just become happy and nice just by virtue of living there id love to spend an entire summer living there it was the perfect place to have a stage race

6852314 only the redlands bicycle classic garners more community support but what i saw spoke volumes to me i have to say i was shocked and felt touched when a local gentleman came up to me looking for some cyclist he made friends with last year

6852318 i gotta say kudos to the town of millersburg and to the race promoter for putting on a great event the way the town came together and the amount of spectators was inspiring
6852319 pretty cool to be able to small talk with bob roll in this setting we talked about his tour experience frustration about travel and airlines and i thought it would be entertaining to run my race strategy by him for the crit just try to hold on to the back what do you think bobke laughed and said well you might want to get up to the front at some point

6852352 we were concerned that the declining oil price and the mechel case would put pressure on the margins of companies and hence their earnings
6852353 foreigners are selling out bonds which is seen from bigger spreads and stocks which is clear from declining benchmarks
6852354 while many investors were plainly shocked by the escalation of the conflict with georgia we think that those bold enough to increase their russia exposure at this time of perceived elevated political risk may be rewarded
6852355 although volatility can be unwelcome in the short term it is precisely at times such as this that active managers can take advantage of market inefficiencies

6852374 saturday this morning canis vulpex a state prisoner who had been confined in the barrel succeeded in effecting his escape by breaking the chain with which it had been found necessary to secure him and went off with it appended to his neck
6852375 two p m one of our scouts don carlo who has just returned saw the prisoner in close conference with the proscribed traitor canis lupus and his wife but he so carefully avoided surprise the don had no opportunity of serving the warrant with which he was charged he gained however some important intelligence having overheard the late prisoner disclosing to his companions the various scenes which he had lately witnessed he described the cave in which he was confined as inhabited by animals standing upright on their hind legs who were almost always eating that notwithstanding their formidable appearance he believed them to be a very timid race for that every morning he saw a great many of these creatures meet together and all at once upon hearing a sharp shrill noise which he thought was made by some other animal they stood in great terror of they ran away and hid themselves in another cave they had under the first and he strongly insisted on it that this noise was not so terrific as that of canis lupus his spleen was however more particularly directed against on which he supposed was a cub who had not yet learned to walk upright as he always went on all fours his spite arose he said from this little creature making faces and growling and doing all he could to annoy him whenever he put his head out of the hole in the side of his cave the conference ended by a mutual agreement to seize this unfortunate animal as soon as opportunity offered from whom they expected to learn more of the prowess and habits of their new foes and of this purpose a variety of stratagems were proposed which will probably be put to execution

6852414 the court hereby adopts the stipulation of the parties as to the appointment of a parenting coordinator with arbitration powers under statute x the parenting coordinator shall be arb man retainer and all subsequent charges shall be split between the parties on a 50 50 basis and shall be paid 30 days from the date of this order
6852415 1 with the consent of all parties the court may appoint an arbitrator to resolve disputes between the parties concerning the parties minor or dependent children including but not limited to parenting time nonrecurring adjustments to child support and disputed parental decisions
6852416 since may of 2005 when i first started as parenting coordinator with arbitration power for this family i have seen virtually no evidence of the ability of the parties to cooperate to make decision jointly mh has spent 2520 on my services to arbitrate decisions regarding the children per court order mh is responsible for only 50 of my charges but since ed has refused to participate financially in the process mh has paid 100 of the costs in order to get decision made and filed with the court all of the arbitrations to date have been awards that basically matched mhs requests these arbitrations were made because mhs requests were seen as being in the best interests of the children i believe that these issues needed to be arbitrated because ed was either going to take no action regarding these issues or act in a unilateral manner regarding these issue in either case both strategies resulted in a type of sole decision making position for ed that mh could only counter through arbitration this process depleted mh of funds that could be used for the children delayed important decision regarding the children and added to the conflict between these two co parents
6852417 mh must consult with ed in writing before any major parental decision is made if ed believes that mh has made a decision that is not in the best interests of the children and she wishes to arbitrate that decision she must contact me copying mh immediately to schedule an arbitration i will schedule an arbitration 10 working days in order for checks to clear after i receive a 600 deposit from each party if mhs decision is reversed or significantly modified through arbitration mh will pay 100 of the arbitration if mhs decision is substantially upheld through the arbitration process then ed will be 100 responsible for the cost of the arbitration
6852418 the arbitrators award shall be effective immediately upon entry and shall continue in effect until vacated by the arbitrator pursuant to section statute a modified or corrected by the arbitrator pursuant to section statute b or modified by the court pursuant to a de novo review under subsection 2 of this section

6852448 given the epidemic of obesity in the u s and the frequent use of statins the positive association we observed raises substantial concern as to the safety of these widely prescribed agents
6852449 we also found no evidence that use of a statin was associated with risk of developing more aggressive subtypes of prostate caner
6852450 overall we found no support for the current hypothesis that statin use may reduce risk of prostate cancer
6852451 current use of a statin was associated with a 50 percent increase in risk of prostate cancer and use for 5 or more years was associated with an 80 percent increase in risk of the disease both of these risk estimates were statistically significant

6852455 the country is way too far in debt to keep throwing money at crooks
6852456 publics trust in the program has been repeatedly tested by reports of waste and fraud
6852457 congressional committees will need to sort out how much of this problem is sloppy documentation and how much reflects payment for medical services that should never have been provided and often werent
6852458 congress must also recognize its own failure to give medicare an important tool to combat fraud and waste
6852459 new competitive bidding program for durable medical equipment that would require a more intense look at the qualifications and integrity of the suppliers

6852464 buchenwald steht f r das dunkelste kapitel unserer vergangenheit andererseits steht weimar als quelle der deutschen klassik auch f r die positiven seiten unserer geschichte und kultur darum unterst tzt mein haus das land th ringen und die stadt weimar nach kr ften dabei das erbe der klassik zu pflegen um die einzigartige rolle weimars mit einem festival zeitgen ssischer kunst auch international zu etablieren f rdert der bund das kunstfest nach einer anschubfinanzierung durch mein haus seit 2007 durch die kulturstiftung des bundes
6852465 our studies encourage broader research programs using different stimulation protocols and longer clinical follow up to clarify the impact this therapy might have gt
6852466 we are assessing possible long lasting effects of electrical stimulation in alzheimers disease patients using repeated session protocols in a larger sample with longer clinical follow up
6852467 knowing what youre voting for is fundamental to our democracy
6852468 if the secretary of state does not clearly let voters know they are choosing between 400 percent interest and 36 percent interest she is aiding and abetting payday lenders whose very business relies on this kind of deception
6852469 the voters deserve to know the actual effect of their votes
6852470 the law requires it and we know that such clarity is your objective as well therefore we believe the language needs to be amended
6852471 if the payday lending industry is going to come into our state and ask us to make their predatory lending practices permanent the voters should at least know what they are voting on
6852472 this years edition has been compiled through briefings with vendors themselves along with conversations with analysts users and system integrators our mission selecting this years products has been deceptively simple select those that deliver robust customer value
6852473 when i got out of coaching at georgetown college my business plan develop my own office in georgetown to provide first class financial service

6852475 thats not whats best for my family thats a family decision
6852476 it came down to an opportunity financially that i need to take advantage of
6852477 i just would be relieved if my opponent was to drop out
6852478 that would change my plans for the fall and would allow me to focus more on the legislative process

6852487 this product is important in that it offers a new approach to the treatment of patients with an uncommon blood disorder who are often very ill
6852488 until now there have been limited fda approved treatments available to patients suffering from chronic adult itp and the treatment options were often unsuccessful for long term use
6852489 significantly higher platelet counts and maintained those higher counts compared to those who did not receive the drug
6852490 i could never be more sadistic than the natural world
6852491 i think it builds character having to make shots like this
6852492 i think its going to be extremely successful im excited about this
6852493 that will include two to three stops in huntington a stop at the barboursville mall area another at the crooked creek park and ride in putnam county and two to three stops in charleston
6852494 you have most of your traffic coming this way charleston in the morning from cabell and putnam county you have most of your travel to huntington going back in the evening
6852495 not only is it practical and efficient and fits todays times but it also serves as a link between charleston and huntington and putnam county
6852496 the more we think about ourselves as one region the better off we are
6852497 tim kaine is my dear dear friend hes a tremendous person a human being he and his wife and his family are friends of ours

6852503 if youve got some form of substance abuse alcohol and drugs it can be the same bag get ahold of it it is going to absolutely take any temptations and desires and multiply them by ten
6852504 to do away with lobbyists would be pretty darn bad because then special interests would come in to really regulate the system
6852505 every child should have access to a play area that is safe and encourages physical activity
6852506 this new playground which was designed by local children and built by volunteers is a small part of our long term commitment to the community and the sussex county ymca
6852507 the sussex county ymca is constantly working towards adding programs and opportunities to better serve its members and add value to their membership
6852508 the opportunity to have a playground built at the ymca not only gives the members a place for their children to play but it reaches out to the community to offer a safe environment for children to have fun the sussex county ymca looks forward to creating healthier happier kids and a stronger more united community through the power of play
6852509 this record has a diverse flow with g rated lyrics some of the songs were recorded especially for this project and some had already been written and we wanted to make it a win win by pairing emerging acts and prot g s with well known acts
6852510 he was found to have died of blunt force trauma to the back of his head
6852511 i dont think a theory has been developed on that
6852512 generally when you drown like that a body turns up fairly quickly and there havent been any bodies found so it looks like he made it out
6852513 when he went into the water he didnt have much with him
6852514 on behalf of the ohio high school athletic association i want to thank nationwide insurance for their continued commitment to the buckle up for a successful season campaign from the beginning nationwide recognized the significance of this campaign and their efforts to encourage teen drivers to buckle up should be applauded we all share a responsibility for the safety of ohios youth and im excited that nationwide will remain a valuable partner in this important cause
6852515 the best way to keep teens safe on the road is by helping them become smart drivers
6852516 buckle up for a successful season reminds teens that being a smart driver starts with fastening your seatbelt
6852517 thirty five million eligible women didnt vote in the 2004 presidential election and it is my hope that this event will help shine a spotlight on this statistic and inspire women to get involved voting is so important to me and my family who were involved in the civil rights movement it is really an honor to work with lifetime and rock the vote to make sure that every woman does count this election
6852518 i am so honored to participate in the every woman counts party with lifetime and rock the vote it is imperative that we never take for granted our rights as american citizens to vote we must remember that our voices do matter

6852523 waterfowl and migratory game bird hunters will see some changes including modifications to the canada goose zone boundaries and expanded opportunities for wood ducks atlantic brant and doves
6852524 however the season for canvasbacks has been closed for 2008 09 and bag limits for scaup have been modified
6852525 many hunters already have purchased their hunting licenses and federal waterfowl stamps in anticipation of the season
6852526 for their convenience in addition to being able to pick up the waterfowl brochure and maps at post offices and license issuing agents hunters can obtain this important information from the game commissions website
6852527 recent analysis of wood duck harvest rates and populations by the usfws suggests wood ducks can tolerate more hunting pressure than currently exists
6852528 an increase in the wood duck daily bag limit will provide more opportunity on this plentiful duck species wood ducks are the second most abundant duck in pennsylvanias waterfowl harvest monitoring tools such as banding and breeding population surveys are presently in place to measure any impacts caused by the bag limit change on wood ducks information gained from this bag limit change will help the usfws and flyway councils develop a wood duck harvest strategy to help better manage this important duck species
6852529 waterfowl managers continue to be concerned about the status of scaup
6852530 this years breeding population estimate for scaup was 27 percent below the long term average the usfws is seeking a 25 percent reduction in scaup harvest commensurate with the status of this duck species to maintain the diving duck hunting tradition on important scaup harvest areas such as lake erie we were allowed to implement a hybrid scaup season composed of a two bird bag for 20 consecutive days during the 60 day duck season
6852531 by answering the questions on the survey card hunters will improve survey efficiency and the quality of information used to track the harvest of migratory birds for management purposes
6852532 information provided by hunters is essential in our efforts to properly manage this resource
6852533 by reporting the recovery of a leg band hunters not only assist in managing the resource but also have an opportunity to learn interesting facts about the bird they harvested
6852534 many hunters have a mindset that life jackets are uncomfortable and too bulky therefore they get in the way
6852535 but todays life jackets are comfortable in fact the coast guard approved manual inflatable life jackets offer great freedom of movement float coats are another good alternative available in hunting colors and patterns they double as both outerwear and a flotation device
6852536 when you have a crew of hunters with decoys and equipment and dogs a boat can easily become unbalanced especially if the wind comes up
6852537 not only is it unsafe to overload a boat exceeding the limits posted on the capacity plate is also illegal
6852538 sudden immersion into cold water is one of the leading causes of boating fatalities in the commonwealth it places a severe strain on bodily systems that can lead to hypothermia or worse cardiac arrest survivors of cold water accidents have reported their breath driven from them on contact with the water
6852539 get into the routine of making the life jacket part of your hunting equipment and wear it
6852540 his blend of off the charts athleticism and long range shooting ability is rare especially for someone his age we believe his best basketball is still to come
6852541 they even tell medical staff leaders to do things that are inappropriate
6852542 to discharge him early without antibiotics that was kind of questionable
6852543 this is a national issue but were here and the patients who are being affected locally are here
6852544 its a lot easier than flying down to texas and shooting patients there
6852545 as long as p e private equity is out of the game and strategics cant get their stocks to stay steady long enough to value deals and as long as the financial institutions are having difficulties of their own its hard to get money to get deals done
6852546 there are a lot of talks going on but nothing is really getting done
6852547 everyone wants to talk right now but you wont see anyone doing anything for a while
6852548 last year we were just hitting the edge of the credit crunch and we were still doing a lot of m amp a deals and we were doing capital raising deals this year its almost all capital raising deals and looking at failed banks and failed bank assets
6852549 there is not much m amp a i have been very busy this year generally capital raising and fire fighting
6852550 that are less directly affected by credit conditions businesses that are more service oriented and less balance sheet oriented

6852559 mr gadd is pleased to be back in this country
6852560 he tells me that his trial in vietnam was a charade was a travesty of justice
6852561 he never got a fair trial and in due course that will be expanded upon
6852562 mr gadd wants through me to say to you that he did not commit the offences for which he was convicted in vietnam
6852563 it was a show trial and he had no opportunity to put his defence forward
6852564 ultimately he wants that to be tested if he can before the courts of this country
6852565 the foul pervert finally had to realise there was no place to run and no place to hide

6852570 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6852571 we know that todays home buyers are more knowledgeable about the process in general and have higher expectations of information provided regarding the homes in which they are interested
6852572 what this survey provides with its in depth demographic analysis is a map to better serving that end consumer
6852573 by providing realtors r with this breadth of information as well as a marketing platform to meet the consumer needs we believe we are providing a valuable solution to the real estate industry

6852579 before you bella my life was like a moonless night very dark but there were stars points of light and reason and then you shot across my sky like a meteor suddenly everything was on fire there was brilliancy there was beauty when you were gone when the meteor had fallen over the horizon everything went black nothing had changed but my eyes were blinded by the light i couldnt see the stars anymore and there was no more reason for anything
6852580 i came into this world big and i am going to continue to get bigger
6852581 im big and beautiful and doing my best to keep my stress levels down so i can stay healthy

6852585 el problema es que este circuito tiene mucha curva y casi no tiene rectas donde los deportistas alcancen a sacar la caramallola y tomar agua
6852586 all of this underscores the fallacy of considering third party and independent candidates only so far as they affect the two major party horse race the truth is elections especially one as volatile as 2008 are decided upon by thousands of variables that can cut both ways nobodys entitled to votes however they are entitled to a level playing field which does not exist today for third party and independent candidates
6852587 we all have to earn our votes and in this volatile election year that is as true as ever
6852588 next week at the democratic party convention obama has a chance to reverse course from his many corporatist and militarist concessions since he clinched the nomination

6852628 the republican party is going to undergo a fairly extended fight for its new identity there are going to be contentions between the social conservatives and the libertarian wings of the party and between the fiscal conservative and economic growth wings of the party
6852629 the research raises the perception both of how common these events are and specifically where they may occur
6852630 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
6852631 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
6852632 we need to step backward from the simple old model where you worry about one large obvious fault like they do in california
6852633 the problem here comes from many subtle faults we now see there is earthquake activity on them each one is small but when you add them up they are probably more dangerous than we thought we need to take a very close look
6852634 the probability is not zero and the damage could be great
6852635 it could be like something out of a greek myth
6852636 indian point is situated at the intersection of the two most striking linear features marking the seismicity and also in the midst of a large population that is at risk in case of an accident
6852637 this is clearly one of the least favorable sites in our study area from an earthquake hazard and risk perspective
6852638 new data developed in the last 20 years disclose a substantially higher likelihood of significant earthquake activity in the vicinity of indian point that could exceed the earthquake design for the facility
6852639 nothing happens for a while then it goes with a bang
6852640 is a major substantiation of a feature that bears on the long term earthquake risk of the northeastern united states
6852641 it gives us the best possible evidence that we have an earthquake hazard here that should be a factor in any planning decision it crystallizes the argument that this hazard is not random there is a structure to the location and timing of the earthquakes this enables us to contemplate risk in an entirely different way and since we are able to do that we should be required to do that
6852642 new york is not as prone to earthquakes as california and japan but they do happen this study takes a more realistic look at the possibility of larger ones and why earthquakes concentrate in certain places to understand risk you have to multiply hazard by assets and vulnerability when you factor that in our risk is high too much attention has been paid to the level of hazard and not enough to the risk earthquake hazard is about the same today as in 1609 when henry hudson sailed up the river but earthquake risk is much much higher today since the number of people assets and their vulnerability are so much greater
6852643 we think that the intersection of these two features being so close to indian point makes it a place of greater risk than most other points on the map
6852644 most people underestimate the hazard here any conservative approach will look at geologically similar environments if you do that we are similar to bhuj india where a 2001 magnitude 7 quake killed over 15 000 people there was no obvious sign of strain there there is a mystery here to be solved and we better step back and do our homework
6852645 once you accept that one fault in a family is active you better consider that all the faults in that family could be active we need to adapt our structures with that in mind
6852646 you could debate whether a magnitude 6 or 7 is possible but weve already had three magnitude fives so that is very realistic
6852647 era previsible que ocurriera y la previmos pero tambi n era evitable y no pudimos evitarla
6852648 no es la primera crisis de este tipo aunque esta vez reviste tonos particularmente tristes y tr gicos era previsible que ocurriera y la previmos pero tambi n era evitable y no pudimos evitarla
6852649 triste pero cierto no cumplimos nuestras promesas en vez de proporcionar m s ayuda fuimos testigos de una tenaz disminuci n de la atenci n prestada a la agricultura

6852651 basta decir que para importar el mismo volumen de alimentos que en el 2007 el a o pasado la misma cantidad este a o se requerir an mil 100 millones de d lares m s para recibir lo mismo
6852652 esto es solo un punto de partida y se necesitar n recursos por un valor 40 veces superior mil 700 millones de d lares para poder elaborar un paquete de desarrollo m s sustancial y completo de cara al futuro
6852653 si no se adoptan de inmediato las medidas pertinentes en los pr ximos 50 a os podr a volverse mucho m s dif cil alimentar a la poblaci n mundial la poblaci n aumentar de 6 mil 500 millones hoy a 8 mil 300 millones en el 2030 y casi 9 mil 200 millones en el 2050 todo ese crecimiento se concentrar en los pa ses en desarrollo por consiguiente ser necesario que en el 2030 la producci n mundial de alimentos haya aumentado en m s del 50 y en el 2050 se haya casi duplicado
6852654 el cambio clim tico plantea de hecho un doble desaf o para la agricultura la adaptaci n de los sistemas de producci n agr cola a las nuevas condiciones agroecol gicas y la necesidad de ayudar a mitigar las repercusiones de dicho cambio en el mundo en su conjunto

6852755 over 40 years ago in a presbytery you would have a couple of priests maybe a housekeeper living there as well there was activity a bit of a buzz around the house now thats gone
6852756 id be concerned that they might be isolated a priest might say a mass in the morning and then go back to the presbytery and see no one for the remainder of the day
6852757 its very important that priests do things together thats why priests working together as part of a team can be very helpful it means that they are interacting with their colleagues and getting a sense of a shared mission id certainly welcome anything that could be done to help priests welfare
6852758 catholics who attempt to confer a sacred order on a woman and the women who attempt to receive a sacred order are by their own actions separating themselves from the church
6852759 we are roman catholics the all male hierarchy and their legal traditions came along with the spiritual package that we embrace we do not have to embrace both if they are contradictory
6852760 nothing or no one can stop the action of gods spirit moving in the church we are not discouraged by excommunication in fact in many ways it is a catalyst for growth
6852761 the church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women
6852762 all people are created by god equal in that we each possess an immortal and individual soul but we are each unique in our talents women are called upon to be mothers spiritually and for many in marriage physically as well whereas men are called upon to be fathers spiritually and for many in marriage physically as well
6852763 as an active woman religious working in the field of retreats and catechesis in the bible belt south i have to say that i am far too busy to feel slighted by the fact that the priesthood is not open to women
6852764 theres always someone right around the corner waiting to move in

6852771 im just really happy its hard work for my entire life that came through now
6852772 i trained really hard for this and im just really happy that i finally get a medal in my individual event

6852775 you might as well put it all on the line and go for broke and it paid off today with a silver medal
6852776 i kind of fought my way on there and i thought theres no time like the present

6852778 the support weve had all year everybodys recognized that we had a shot at this thing such enthusiasm such support and thats a big motivator to us

6852798 how we can ensure that students are engaged that they are invested in their education
6852799 i think its incredibly important to make sure students take ownership of their learning
6852800 i think the incentive should come from within just to want to do well rather than doing it for a dollar
6852801 i think middle schoolers should have rewards for getting good grades and stuff on their tests i would save it for college and maybe give some to charity

6852889 the anti vaccination movement is based on irrational fears and is absolutely destructive
6852890 vaccines are mainly for the sake of the herd but no one cares about the community however if you want to protect the entire population you have to vaccinate
6852891 i cant say that every kid who doesnt get vaccinated will get the measles
6852892 it really depends on where you live but vaccines are pretty well regulated and drug makers arent making a lot of money on them contrary to popular belief getting vaccinated is basically for the public good
6852893 parents need to know that the internet can be disinhibiting to young people and adults alike
6852894 and people do things on the internet they wouldnt do in daily life they offer information they wouldnt normally offer in an interpersonal interaction thats more human
6852895 you literally need to warn them that what they do on the internet is real
6852896 ive had teenage patients who have sent naked photos or partially naked photos to boyfriends and if those things get passed around it can carry a terrible stigma and lead to bullying both in and out of school parents need to warn youths that if they do something thats inappropriate it places them at risk
6852897 bullying is bullying whether its done on the internet or in person and it has significant emotional ramifications
6852898 so children need to know that they can come to their parents anytime anyone makes them feel unsafe
6852899 when somebody is bullied it often means that they have sensitivities that someone else believes are valuable
6852900 the first step is defining the problem assessing what is happening and going quickly to the students teacher and let them know whats happening
6852901 parents need to be the first line of defense and take bullying very seriously if they have a relationship with the other childs parents they may want to reach out in a confidential way
6852902 sexual behavior between teens and adolescents is more common that most of us appreciated in the past
6852903 so its important for parents to share with their child that self respect involves your body too and there are risks to sexual contact
6852904 you have to give them a twofold message that the risk of pregnancy exists and theres also the tremendous risk of stds including hiv and this is important because hiv education is one of those things that has receded yet its just as important as ever
6852905 we have very large percentages of kids using drugs or alcohol and that should be something that every parent is talking to every child about
6852906 these are pervasive in most towns and cities in america and kids need to know that youre relying on them to not break the law at all when it comes to the use of illicit drugs and yet its so commonplace that young people try these things you also have to let them know that there will never be a time when youre not willing to listen when they need to talk
6852907 what we want is for kids to experience all the varied emotions that go with maturing and feeling competent and to be able to navigate the choppy waters that go with that
6852908 and alcohol and drugs dont make that any easier also we know that violent crime and many indiscretions take place in the presence of alcohol and drugs
6852909 there was an interesting study done in japan over a 25 year period during the 1960s to the 1980s it was done at a time when the flu and other vaccines were mandatory and what they found was that during that period the mortality rate due to the flu was down a million and the rate of respiratory illness were down over 200 000 so that shows you how important vaccines are
6852910 getting kids to wash their hands more can be done but its difficult
6852911 it would require a complete mindset change so for now the best we can do is let schools handle it the way they do and do our best to isolate sick kids
6852912 its an enormous problem because our schools are serving crap
6852913 how about we put calorie labels on cafeteria food like we do at baskin robbins

6852919 throughout his career al franken has been a strong voice for the american people using wit and wisdom to call our attention to our countrys most important challenges as gas prices rise and global warming threatens our way of life washington has never been in greater need of his leadership this country needs a leader like al franken to lead the fight for new sources of energy that will protect our planet end our dependence on oil and create millions of jobs

6852931 if you vote for mitt romney you are voting for satan
6852932 as for the one mormon running for office those who really believe in god will defeat him anyways so dont worry about that thats a temporary situation
6852933 romney is an unashamed and proud member of the mormon cult founded by a murdering polygamist pedophile named joseph smith nearly 200 years ago the teachings of the mormon cult are doctrinally and theologically in complete opposition to the absolute truth of gods word there is no common ground if mormonism is true then the christian faith is a complete lie there has never been any question from the moment smiths cult began that it was a work of satan and those who follow their false teachings will die and spend eternity in hell
6852934 i guess what i can tell you is it shows that bigotry can still rear its ugly head in society
6852935 its sad that anyone would target a fellow american on the issue of faith
6852936 i have watched in horror over the past weeks as one evangelical christian leader after another has either endorsed supported or just as bad refused to denounce romneys run for the white house and those christian leaders who support him
6852937 last weekend pat robertson founder of cbn and regent university had romney deliver the keynote address to the graduates of regent regent is one of the great christian colleges in this nation and robertson allowed this cult member to deliver the commencement address is he out of his mind do you think there would ever be a true gospel preacher giving the commencement address at brigham young
6852938 i have been warning you for years now about this cult born out of the pits of hell and responsible for sending millions of souls to eternal damnation
6852939 for the nearly 200 years this cult has been in existence they have strived for mainstream acceptance they are the most devious of all the cults since they have always tried to portray themselves as just another christian group when in fact they are no more christian than a muslim is their deception starts with their name the church of jesus christ of latter day saints sounds like a christian church doesnt it some mormons have recently changed their name to simply community of christ to disguise even better who they are in an attempt to lure people in
6852940 there are reportedly 12 million mormons worldwide half of those in the united states
6852941 the worldwide holdings of the mormon cult are in the tens of billions of dollars mitt romney is the first member of this cult who has had the legitimate opportunity to help them achieve their goal of mainstream acceptance while holding the most powerful office in the world romney will have the full resources of this cult behind him in his bid for the white house
6852942 those who follow the false teachings of this cult believe in the false jesus of the mormon cult and reject faith in the one true jesus of the bible will die and spend eternity in hell
6852943 romney getting elected president will ultimately lead millions of souls to the eternal flames of hell
6852944 please take some time today and pray for mitt romney and all those who have been deceived by the lies of the mormon cult
6852945 the fact is that unless they renounce those lies and turn to faith in the one true jesus of the bible they will die and spend eternity in hell pray also for these christian leaders who have for whatever reason foolishly aligned themselves with romney pray the holy spirit will convict them and that they will renounce romney and find a candidate to support who will hold to biblical values there is no excuse no justification for supporting and voting for a man who will be used by satan to lead the souls of millions into the eternal flames of hell
6852946 the only reason immunizations will be denied is in the case of religious beliefs

6853075 dnssec has suffered from a chicken and the egg problem for many years
6853076 domain owners that sign their zones have no guarantee that an end user will actually receive the authentic dns data and not some forged data from an attacker the only way the end user will be protected from forged data is if the isp internet service provider is dnssec enabled and can validate the answer from a signed domain but isps have no reason to enable dnssec unless there are actually signed zones out there to validate
6853077 to achieve scalability of up to hundreds of thousands of zones and millions of records signer employs high speed cryptographic algorithms that provide over 6 000 rsa operations per second with a 1024 bit key
6853078 in addition signer can be configured to sign zones either in bulk or incrementally making it possible to deploy it in the largest and most dynamic environments without compromising existing update intervals
6853079 with seven million names in org it would be a significant strengthening of the core infrastructure on the internet if org had the base that would allow for dnssec to be supported

6853122 glaubst du dass sich das team haupts chlich auf fernando konzentriert und dass du dadurch etwas zur ckh ngst

6853135 peacekeeping checkpoints in the security zone inside georgia have started carrying out the tasks set before them in this way the russian side has implemented the agreements set out by the presidents of russia and france
6853136 it is my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6853137 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6853138 the russians want to have eight peacekeeping checkpoints outside south ossetia but that is not agreed with us or with international mediators so it is not russias right to decide unilaterally how many checkpoints will be here

6853885 op het moment nog niet ik heb zelfs gehoord dat windmolens slechter voor het milieu zijn dan gewone stroom dit komt omdat bouw en onderhoud van deze molens veel energie kosten daar komt bij dat oliemaatschappijen niet met groene energie bezig zijn zolang zij dat niet gaan doen zie ik geen verandering ik heb wel vertrouwen in de toekomst hoor er zijn genoeg mensen die steeds inventiever worden ik hoop dat ze met een goed productief alternatief komen iets wat niet te duur is en niet zoveel onderhoud kost
6853886 volgens mij is groene stroom helemaal niet duurder al weet ik dat niet zeker mijn kamer is all inclusive ik houd me er daarom ook niet zo mee bezig ik wist niet dat het formulier van de groningse studentenbond bestond wel handig dat je op die manier groene stroom kunt aanvragen al zie ik het mezelf nog niet doen
6853887 nee dat vind ik geen goed idee je kan mensen niet forceren om milieubewust te worden dat moet uit zichzelf ontstaan er zijn ook nog niet genoeg voordelen van groene energie veel milieubewuste zaken zijn wel dubbel hoor net zoals die gesubsidieerde toyota prius maar dat terzijde
6853888 groene stroom is inderdaad beter voor het milieu het heeft zeker nut kijk er is uiteindelijk maar een klein percentage echte groene stroom die je ontvangt maar groene stroom is wel erg belangrijk door daarvoor te betalen investeren we in duurzame energie
6853889 deze stelling klopt niet want volgens mij is het helemaal niet duurder als de prijs van gewone stroom blijft stijgen wordt groene stroom goedkoper ik denk dat er binnen nu en vijftien jaar een combinatie is van kernenergie en groene energie maar dan met in verhouding meer groene energie het ligt er trouwens ook aan hoeveel mensen voor groene energie kiezen h er moet wel vraag naar zijn wil zoiets een succes worden
6853890 mee eens maar het woord verplicht klinkt zo ja het is wel een goed woord hoor er zou gewoon geen keuze moeten zijn het zou beter zijn als iedereen groene stroom had
6853891 nee dat is echt onzin groene stroom is voor iedereen bedoeld

6853971 the occ is essentially saying that if banks cant trick or cheat consumers they wont be able to offer credit
6853972 it is outrageous that the federal regulator overseeing the banking industry is so out of step with the needs of millions of americans unfairly trapped in debt by abusive credit card practices
6853973 better disclosure of unfair practices is not real consumer protection
6853974 consumers should have the confidence of knowing that their interest rates wont skyrocket if the bill or payment gets lost in the mail
6853975 the occs argument that credit will dry up unless banks can engage in questionable lending practices sounds eerily similar to the arguments made by the mortgage industry right before the current foreclosure crisis
6853976 the mortgage meltdown demonstrates the importance of ending abusive lending practices when warning signs arise we urge the federal reserve board to adopt these critical protections against unfair credit card practices
6853977 we continue to believe that the contagion effect of sub prime and credit related issues within financials has largely been under estimated
6853978 therefore we believe there remains a high likelihood of additional weakness to earnings estimates heading into the months ahead until analysts and companies alike become even more conservative with their assumptions
6853979 we tell the sons of france the slaves of america and their masters too that our finger is on the trigger and the convoys of martyrs are longing to rampage your bastions in defence of our islamic nation
6853980 i loved the outline that was in the suggested motion i just didnt like where the discussion was going away from the work of the board
6853981 if they start enforcing the caps were going to have to change service
6853982 this isnt really an issue thats just going to be about frontier
6853983 virtually every broadband provider has been suddenly discovering that theres this so called bandwidth crisis going on in the united states
6853984 if they continue to make the necessary investments theres no reason they cant keep up
6853985 i dont see how they came up with their numbers
6853986 they feel that mr zardari will be the best candidate for the country he will keep the federation together and promote harmony as well as national unity
6853987 the way mr zardari handled the issue of president pervez musharrafs resignation is really admirable
6853988 right now the us is keen to allow a more populist figure to come to take charge zardari may have been tainted with corruption allegations in the past but the ppp also has an image an image of tolerance and liberal values
6853989 though he handcuffed me humiliated my family tried to destroy my party put me in a dungeon in a 500 year old fort put me in exile for seven years that is all gone i hold nothing against him personally
6853990 but no one seems to want to do so yet
6853991 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6853992 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6853993 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
6853994 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6853995 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6853996 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis
6853997 now israel claims that gaza is no longer occupied yet israeli forces patrol gazas borders by land seas and air so the point of this mission is to get two ships to sail from cyprus into gaza to challenge this illegal occupation
6853998 if i had played just one more time i would have won that jackpot
6853999 if i had played more coins i would have won more money
6854000 one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
6854001 also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells
6854002 because extractions of wisdom teeth are commonly operated in dental clinics we can expect a lot of donors of stem cells
6854003 that enable us to create stem cells of various genetic codes eliminating the risk that a body of a patient would reject transplanted tissues or organs
6854004 we didnt have electricity not television not even much radio so we entertained ourselves you could go to any house and everybody was playing music

6854026 a pair of kerouacs armed with sharpies and erasers and righteous indignation
6854027 discovered a hand rendered sign inside that i regret to report contained a few errors
6854028 i was reluctant to disfigure the sign any further still i think i shall be haunted by that perversity emense in my train whistle blighted dreams tonight
6854029 statement on the signage of our national parks and public lands to come
6854030 i definitely want to get something bad on the road
6854031 big enough for all my friends and to scare all the cars away from me im a good driver but its everyone else that im worried about
6854032 most everyone dresses up on their sweet 16 not me im going to be ready to get in the water and ready get on the crazy rides thats all i want to do the entire time is ride the rides
6854033 when i saw putin speak on russian television his eyes staring into the camera i knew who he was talking to it was saakashvili
6854034 he will not stop until he removes saakashvili from power
6854035 moscow thinks that once georgia is destroyed economically militarily and morally all the anger will be directed against the government but moscow was never really able to read the caucasus
6854036 despite a number of problems georgia deserves freedom and the prospects of democratic development
6854037 georgia and its future are beyond one regime or government
6854038 this is not the time to criticize who did what
6854039 later some questions need to be answered but not now when the entire country is under attack he saakashvili cant step back now
6854040 what was he thinking couldnt he just stay quiet and stop poking putin he can speak about nato all he wants but russian tanks are on georgia soil now people are dying and suffering what did he do to avoid this what did nato do
6854041 there always will be georgians that will say that the georgian government did this and that but thats a beauty of democracy
6854042 wants to give young people the idea that this will be your destiny if you join their enemies the police and security forces
6854043 we are facing an extraordinary situation in algeria and there have been at least five attacks in the last two months aimed at police and security forces
6854044 but the group is viewed increasingly as outsiders coming in to attack algeria theres no evidence they have more support among the population this is still a localized thing
6854045 the increase in violence more or less coincides with the decision of the gspc to take on an international affiliation and become al qaeda in the islamic maghreb
6854046 they get more support from abroad now and see themselves as part of a larger movement
6854047 there was always international influence on these organization in the 1990s but at the same time there was always a clear sense that they were an algerian movement
6854048 do not mean that the civil war has restarted but they do indicate that the fundamental social and political tensions that created the violence of the 1990s and the problems resulting from the war remain unresolved
6854049 the government says there are only 300 to 500 people in al qaeda but those numbers are probably not true anymore
6854050 it seems to be growing and its ability to carry out large scale attacks has certainly grown even from a year ago

6854072 while we would hope that all ohio businesses would make paid sick days available to their employees whenever possible we believe that this initiative is unworkable unwieldy and would be detrimental to ohios economy and we will be opposing it and asking ohioans to oppose it as a result
6854073 evidence shows that al bashir masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part the fur masalit and zaghawa groups on account of their ethnicity
6854074 we live as if we are natives here we feel that this is our country and this is our town
6854075 there is no such thing as arab or african we are all sudanese
6854076 thats my friend abubakr hes from the african tama tribe
6854077 there are problems in darfur but they are not between people they are related to the government and to politics
6854078 no single tribe in sudan can claim it is purely african or arab
6854079 the government made use of the conflict in darfur in a kind of non thoughtful way
6854080 it was not sensitive to the tribal relationships the tribal history of the area and the resources
6854081 the disputes between the arabs and people in darfur originate from different reasons grazing pastures natural things they are not rooted in race
6854082 the arabs that are here have nothing to do with this
6854083 who supported them who gave them the guns wasnt it the government
6854084 i can interact with arabs at work or in general ways but when it comes to close relationships i feel there is a wall between us
6854085 we were still looking for dichotomy of some kind something that would explain what was going on easily and simply we latched onto the arab african dichotomy which did vast damage then as the conflict developed it became a reality on the ground it became something by which people explained the conflict themselves

6854290 im really excited about the leadership of our three seniors
6854291 it is amazing to see how cohesive they are as a group we are a very young team but having three leaders like them will give us some much needed momentum at the start of the year and be a huge benefit down the stretch
6854292 if we can keep the injury bug away and keep some key players close to 90 percent we will be a team to be reckoned with in the horizon league staying healthy will be our top priority
6854293 everyone looks for porshia to take the big swings for us
6854294 she is such an exciting player to watch and the fact that her hitting has become so much more consistent only makes her more effective
6854295 she was outstanding as a freshman but she is even better now she will be the one to contend with on the outside on our team
6854296 katie played great for us as a freshman last season
6854297 her overall strength has greatly improved as has her court awareness
6854298 stephanie has shown a lot of maturity and has worked hard to improve her game
6854299 she has great strength on the outside so she can hit a very heavy ball
6854300 if we can get stephanie anywhere near 100 percent her potential is almost limitless
6854301 were hoping she can stay healthy because she can really have a huge impact on the team
6854302 she is experienced and has a great work ethic that will translate to the court
6854303 we are excited about the options our depth at setter gives us this year
6854304 we will have the opportunity to let dana do some hitting and have brittany provide some depth on defense
6854305 all three of our setters have unbelievable work ethic and are smart enough to run the offense i wouldnt be surprised to see all three doing setting for us this year
6854306 she is our leader on the floor and she sets a great example for the rest of our setters
6854307 brittany made possibly the biggest jump of anyone at setter
6854308 she improved her game greatly over the spring and she added even more experience during our nicaragua trip where she was our primary setter
6854309 she has a fiery passion for the game and exhibits the kind of demeanor that is necessary to be a successful setter
6854310 jalesa got some good experience as a freshman last year
6854311 she has become a lot stronger thanks to some dedicated strength training during the summer and i think she could be one of the top middle blockers in the conference this year
6854312 she has added a lot of strength in the off season and will provide some good competition for a starting spot in the middle
6854313 maureen might have our best one foot take off and is extremely strong in the upper body
6854314 the biggest key to her success will be how quickly she can learn the system she has a good shot to contend for one of our starting spots in the middle
6854315 she has matured physically and has gotten stronger she is going to be phenomenal this year and has set herself up to have her best season as a senior
6854316 chloes game has improved greatly over the spring and summer
6854317 she will continue to be a huge threat to our opponents with her ability to keep the ball off the floor

6854327 every day is a constant challenge for our team to be more effective innovative better market researchers and understanding that profit centered decisions are paramount

6854329 jake is trustworthy and maybe one the most underrated minds in the entire industry when jake showed interest in joining silvercash com over a year ago i was absolutely thrilled to have him join our team jake has been the perfect fit
6854330 entering our 12 th year of operations we find ourselves in an environment that has been the most challenging to date
6854331 there are a number of reasons one can hypothesize about the current state of the market however i am confident that there is one component of the solution we can all agree on the need for trustworthy leaders and managers are in high demand team players like silvercash jake are proven contributors to our team and i certainly value his efforts more importantly as a team we have a cohesive corporate culture that allows us to be competitive but truly have fun at the same time

6854488 big xii most pundits have already placed missouri and oklahoma in the big xii title game but as lee corso would say not so fast my friend my big xii sleeper will get both of those teams back to back missouri at home and oklahoma in the red river rivalry thats right my sleeper pick is the texas longhorns texas has never exactly been known as a tough punch you in the face nasty program thats willing to get its hands dirty but they are known for being ridiculously talented and austin has basically been an nfl farm system for years

6854490 acc the anointed one this season in the acc has been the clemson tigers but the acc atlantic division has another team that could give the tigers a run for their money my sleeper in the acc is last seasons atlantic division champs the boston college eagles
6854491 big east the west virginia mountaineers have quickly become the kings of the big east but they havent been exactly dominant the last few seasons even with all their talent the mountaineers have dropped at least two conference games in each of the last two championship seasons this season west virginia will have to contend with south florida pittsburgh and last seasons co champ connecticut but it could be my sleeper the cincinnati bearcats that surprises the entire conference

6854549 learned pastor who the church has lost a kind and pious man who tirelessly brought the good news of christ to people
6854550 love for the word of god and the sanctification of sunday are now the particular testimony of bishop egger which will help the faithful and parish communities to make the encounter with the god of love the center of their lives
6854551 profound relationship with the sacred scriptures which molded his entire life and from which he learned thus the celebration of the eucharist constituted the central moment of his spiritual life and therefore he celebrated sunday mass in a profoundly pastoral way with the faithful of his diocese
6854552 aptly expresses the life of this man of the church as a christian a religious and a bishop his example is an invitation to each one of us to open ourselves to the love of god and enliven it with consistent effort in order to bring out in our own lives the authentic following of love
6854553 offers his full support for the eternal rest of the deceased
6854554 likewise i beg of our lord to send the condolences of his holiness benedict xvi to the families of the deceased along with his spiritual closeness and desire for a quick and full recovery of the injured in this unfortunate accident
6854555 shes done seminal work on christian feminism social justice and the relationship between religion and ecology
6854556 her public position and the symbol of this chair are in direct conflict
6854557 this chair is a powerful visible symbol of roman catholic theology and in roman catholic theology abortion is disallowed
6854558 chair holders are to be distinguished theologians who think from within the roman catholic tradition while exploring and expressing the tradition in contemporary contexts
6854559 this is a woman who is in favor of abortion in favor of contraception homosexuality and women priests
6854560 i mean how much more anti catholic can you get
6854561 as a catholic institution for higher education our understanding of ourselves is that we are to uphold the churchs teachings on abortion and other subjects as the holy father calls for
6854562 a national organization that works for catholic women to be priests and for a more inclusive roman catholic church
6854563 an arm of the abortion lobby in the united states and throughout the world
6854564 it appears to me that some right wing group has put pressure on the university
6854565 catholic voters continue to support republican john mccain over democrat barack obama in the presidential race
6854566 mccain leads by nine percentage points in our two person head to head polling but there is still a significant slice who are yet undecided
6854567 catholic voters tell us they are more likely to be concerned about international issues than the average american voter and they also care more about social issues particularly abortion
6854568 mccains strength among catholic voters comes as russian troops moved into the republic of georgia and as he put in a strong straightforward performance at the saddleback civil forum in california
6854569 in that forum there was a clear distinction between mccain and obama on the question of when a human life begins and catholic voters may be responding warmly to mccains defense of his pro life stance at that forum
6854570 wright was so over the top they figured anyone nominated for president by a major political party couldnt possibly hold opinions that extreme
6854571 have led to greater public awareness of his extremism on abortion
6854572 the issue of infanticide and obama has become a national story
6854573 declare a moratorium on immigrations raids in the state of rhode island until our nation can implement a comprehensive and just reform of our immigration laws
6854574 state police and prison officials to identify illegal immigrants for possible deportation
6854575 a moratorium on immigration raids in the state of rhode island until our nation can implement a comprehensive and just reform of our immigration laws
6854576 it is our hope that such reform will make immigration raids obsolete until then we believe that raids on the immigrant community are unjust unnecessary and counter productive
6854577 as religious leaders we understand and support the need to apprehend and arrest individuals who are responsible for felonies and other serious crimes
6854578 the arrest of serious criminals is not what we have observed in the arrest and detention of immigrants that has taken place recently in our state
6854579 what we have witnessed is that the police action of ice against immigrants has divided the community instilled fear in our streets disrupted the everyday life of good people and separated family members innocent of any crime from one another
6854580 as religious leaders concerned for our people we would be negligent of our pastoral duties if we didnt speak out against these unjust government policies and practices
6854581 agents should not be forced to participate in such raids if agents conclude that such actions are immoral or contrary to their personal or religious beliefs
6854582 we encourage the agents and staff of ice to evaluate the morality of their participation in immigration raids in the context of their faith and sanctity of their conscience if their discernment leads them to the conclusion that they cannot participate in such raids in good conscience we urge them not to do so if ice agents refuse to participate in immigration raids in conformity with their faith and conscience we urge the federal government to fully respect the well founded principles of conscientious objection
6854583 it seemed like there was an unmet need in two situations
6854584 recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs and we had children dying whose family wanted to donate and we werent able to do it
6854585 in my opinion its an open and shut case they dont have irreversibility and they dont have death
6854586 although it may be perfectly ethical to remove vital organs for transplantation from patients who satisfy the diagnostic criteria of brain death the reason it is ethical cannot be that we are convinced they are really dead
6854587 rtao does not make express advocacy communications but rather only does issue advocacy the supreme court has stated that such issue advocacy is constitutionally protected as it conveys information and educates an issue ads impact on an election if it exists at all will come only after the voters hear the information and choose uninvited by the ad to factor it into their voting decisions wisconsin right to life inc v federal election commission wrtl ii
6854588 it will be subject to an enforcement action by the fec and doj for violating campaign finance laws
6854589 its unfortunate that before an organization can exercise its first amendment right to speak out on an issue it must first seek an injunction in federal court
6854590 something must change im hopeful that as a result of this case and others like it we can push back overreaching campaign finance laws and restore to the people the right to speak out on political issues
6854591 a few days after the death of marcela on august 7 2008 justice marco aurelio sent a letter to several organizations inviting them to participate in public hearings on the issue scheduled for august 26 28 the hearings appear to be held for the promotion of abortion
6854592 only two are pro life the bishops conference of brazil and the national pro life and pro family association both decided to participate along with catholics for a free choice and the universal church of the kingdom of god which both support abortion
6854593 does not want to invite the families of anencephaly babies to the hearings such as the mother of marcela de jesus ferreira who despite suffering from anencephaly lived for one year and eight months
6854594 the mere memory of the girl is an obstacle to the approval
6854595 she was with me for as long as god permitted she was an angel god sent to me
6854596 i was sad but i did not cry i was not losing something god came looking for something that he gave me the rare jewel he entrusted to my care i feel her absence but my conscience is clear i made the right choice life for her
6854597 should lead neurologists to review the conclusion that it is impossible to have consciousness without the presence of a brain
6854598 if we dont take the necessary measures in the present
6854599 violating this right to life or creating exceptions for his universal and full protection puts us at risk for being sorry in the future that we did not take the necessary measures today
6854600 a gift and a right and therefore nobody has the right to attack suppress sell torture assault kidnap or kill the valuable personal experience of the life of each human being
6854601 the catholic church holds out hope that good will prevail and that mexico will begin a time of greater dialogue and solidarity in which every human being will possess the same dignity and deserve the same respect of their fundamental rights
6854602 that we will leave it there because there are some causes which must not be surrendered and citizens have to fight for the respect for life
6854603 principles that aim simply to enlighten the consciences of persons according to the faith im a person governed by more profound principles rather than by superficial ones
6854604 caused by blood clotting caused by factors related to taking the oral contraceptive pill
6854605 if we had read the pills directions more carefully maybe we would still have tanya here
6854606 my daughter wasnt a vain person but shed had acne for 13 years and just wanted to clear it up
6854607 extremely high risk of having a baby that is severely deformed
6854608 we very much hope that the pope will come to china
6854609 its a great aspiration and we hope it will materialize relations with the vatican are constantly improving
6854610 all chinese catholics love and respect the pope and recognize his authority
6854611 we hope he can visit china as soon as possible that would be good for the chinese catholic church however the first step is to establish diplomatic relations
6854612 we cannot be certain about how the divine economy operates but the response to the via crucis showed the spiritual power of christ our lord and his redemptive history
6854613 tranquil nature that reveals a good and gentle man at peace with himself and with the world around him
6854614 people said they had the feeling he was taking to them personally benedict xvi was happy and thankful for the official and public cordiality that was shown to him and he was perhaps a bit surprised at the depth of faith he found
6854615 the english benedictine john bede polding and the staff of the first australian cardinal francis patrick moran of irish origin
6854616 we all have the same egyptian blood and if the purpose of the measure is to prohibit the traffic of organs we reject it because that could occur as well among the faithful of the same religion
6854617 we fear that in the future there will be hospitals for christians and hospitals for muslims
6854618 to protect poor muslim from rich christians who buy their organs and vice versa
6854619 to prevent any attempt to deceive the infirm and rob them of their organs especially if this occurs between christians and muslims because in this case it does open the door to a crisis between both communities
6854620 yesterday there was an upgrade of lehman and today theres news that there may be a suitor there
6854621 what everyone is looking for is that weve seen the worst in financials
6854622 if you can grasp that straw of hope you can extrapolate that maybe an end is getting nearer
6854623 with the removal of these weapons off the streets we are directly saving lives of iraqi citizens and coalition forces
6854624 the principles of justice and fair play protect the weak against the strong
6854625 the first major evangelical critic of the new age movement
6854626 i started thinking i was looking at some very serious religious apostasy combined with some political elements
6854627 the books all sounded more like each other rather than the respective teachings of their respective denominations
6854628 it is time for more revelation and jesus is the flesh made messenger to bring that light to man but in the ages yet to come man will attain to greater lights and finally at last a mighty master soul will arise to light the way to the throne of i slammed that book shut i knew i just looked at something about and promoting and preparing folks for the antichrist
6854629 so help me i did not know that they had a slogan
6854630 how do i find pagans witches covens teachers in my area
6854631 is a popular saying in most pagan and craft communities
6854632 spaceship earth global village interdependence i had noticed this strong thread of mysticism both eastern and western running through it
6854633 convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that this may very well be what was described in the bible as the last political social movement that will bring the antichrist on the scene
6854634 oh yes thats very perceptive of you ive been convinced of that for many years myself
6854635 he shall honor in his estate a god of forces a god whom his fathers knew not
6854636 who is the liar but he who denies jesus is the christ is antichrist he that denies the father and the son and suddenly she warren had a mystic crystal revelation she told me too much and she started trying frantically to take it back
6854637 this is a great device this kind of device cannot be produced by japanese manufacturers never
6854638 to do that clear direction clear vision clear leadership are necessary
6854639 a visit to the u s by chief minister modi will provide tacit approval of his reprehensible statements policies and actions
6854640 i respectfully request your leadership in publicly condemning his actions and policies by once again denying chief minister narendra modi the right to enter this country
6854641 mr modi has not accepted any invitation to speak anywhere and all of this is a way for ngos all over the world to become famous by insulting him
6854642 narendraji modi has made only one thing clear he will not go to any place where gujarat is being insulted
6854643 the victory of 2007 is a reaffirmation of the peoples faith in his leadership statesmanship and governance which he displayed in last six years as chief minister
6854644 modis model of good governance is being applauded within the country and beyond
6854645 i believe the olympics will make china more open more transparent more tolerant and more confident
6854646 the chinese government has become more confident because of a successful olympics that helps the liberal wing of the leaders they will argue that we should not be so scared of the international media and international integration and also to a certain extent openness or transparency
6854647 after the olympics the reform effort that has been stalled by the pressures of hosting a major international event could be restarted
6854648 if those freedoms can be extended to chinese journalists that could be one of the positive results of the games
6854649 im disappointed but not surprised by the not very substantial measures that the chinese took to remain in line with their commitments for the olympic games
6854650 china was trying to send a message to the outside world that it was willing to take measures to open up but internally the main concern was preserving stability and i dont think that after the games that will change so much
6854651 theyll keep most of the things in place certainly the harassment of the dissidents and we wont see any kind of greater move towards liberalization or opening up or anything like that
6854652 did this change chinas view in the world is this a turning point no it will just reinforce your sense of a party thats completely insecure and lacking a great deal of confidence
6854653 if it can settle the case its something that our office has decided would be a satisfactory resolution to the case
6854654 i say my prayers i read a book of devotion i prepare for or receive the sacrament but while i do these things there is so to speak a voice inside me that urges caution it tells me to be careful to keep my head not to go too far not to burn my boats i come into the presence of god with a great fear lest anything should happen to me within that presence which will prove too intolerably inconvenient when i have come out again into my ordinary life
6854655 it is acquiescence that is fatal the permitted regularized presence of an area in ourselves which we still claim for our own we may never this side of death drive the invader out of our territory but we must be in the resistance not in the vichy government and this so far as i can yet see must begin again every day
6854656 they should put their eyes out so they cant commit any more crimes
6854657 prison isnt a solution anymore they just form their own gangs inside prison and come out stronger
6854658 a spiderweb of corruption has penetrated many parts of our department
6854659 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6854660 who right now may be afraid to eat uncooked produce
6854661 we are currently doing extensive testing with irradiation and it looks to be very promising
6854662 they tried to reach a compromise solution but it is too early to say they reached an agreement about all issues
6854663 the iraqi government wants as a sovereign country to be the master of the law in iraq
6854664 there needs to be a strict timetable otherwise these forces will stay forever not having a timetable means they will never leave
6854665 the negotiators have made really really good progress they are satisfied with where they are
6854666 but obviously it is going to be the prime ministers call so this is a chance for me to sit there with him
6854667 we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a final and successful conclusion
6854668 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people that respects iraqi sovereignty that allows us to lay the kind of foundation that we need to make sure that we complete the work that weve all sacrificed so greatly to see accomplished
6854669 it will be an excellent agreement when we finally have agreement
6854670 we have spoken with a number of prominent european family offices who were clearly impressed by the returns that are being generated
6854671 the people we spoke with wanted to know about the sustainability and pace of the reform agenda in dubai
6854672 they also wanted to find out about the areas that offered the most attractive investment opportunities
6854673 local family businesses are now in a position to compete in a liberal market place many have the ingredients necessary to become major regional players but they recognize the need for a partner with contacts to facilitate the expansion process
6854674 were in the lead not only in india but in the whole world in delivering health care for the poor
6854675 i have no doubt that this will be a model for the rest of the world
6854676 what india needs is a robust public private partnership with a focus on preventive primary and secondary care
6854677 the accent should be on low cost high impact interventions
6854678 you always find out whos been swimming naked when the tide goes out we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach
6854679 in my judgment it wont be any better five months from now
6854680 i found the bagel store after crossing the brooklyn bridge and traversing through brooklyn up to williamsburg
6854681 we believe that 95 percent is the minimally acceptable probability of success for a given initial withdrawal rate

6854683 classic constant 1 25 of initial real value of portfolio
6854684 classic constant 1 25 of initial real value of portfolio
6854685 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
6854686 we believe that 95 percent is the minimally acceptable probability of success for a given initial withdrawal rate
6854687 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6854688 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6854689 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6854690 everyone says they would accept a face transplant if they were disfigured
6854691 i didnt intend to make you fall head over tits for me
6854692 do you like coffee or milk or do you like the stuff in between
6854693 region against region north against south and government against opposition
6854694 i hate weddings cause old people always poke you and say youre next so i started doing that sh t to them at funerals
6854695 on august 16 1940 lieutenant william ryders platoon of volunteers lined up their parachutes on lawson field at fort benning georgia
6854696 later that day they climbed inside a b 18 aircraft and made their first jump from it while in flight it was on this field in georgia where a group of young soldiers became the first paratroopers of the united states army
6854697 since world war ii our airborne forces have earned an impressive reputation
6854698 they are known around the world because of their discipline their tenacity and their will to win
6854699 the sky dragons of the xviii airborne corps and all paratroopers have continued to maintain a professional warrior reputation through their actions here in iraq which is extremely important in a counterinsurgency environment
6854700 as i walk through markets in places like mosul and sadr city it is clear to me that iraqi citizens have faith and trust in our troopers and that is absolutely necessary for us to achieve our goals
6854701 it feels great to be able to take part in history and it was a nice surprise
6854702 i was made aware yesterday that i was going to be able to take part in the cake cutting and im really glad i did
6854703 you cant help but feel proud to be airborne during a ceremony like this
6854704 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6854705 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6854706 you clearly either dont have a digital camera or else you dont take many pictures
6854707 my kid is now 1 year old and i already have 100g of digital video stored on dvds dvd quality and photos how should i store it so that its still readable 10 to 20 years from now will dvds stil be around and readable 10 years from now should i plan for technology changes every 5 to 10 years dvd gt blue ray gt whatever is optical storage better or should i try to use hard drives making technology changes automatic and if the answer is optical how do you store optical disks so that they last
6854708 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
6854709 id like to be able to back up photos music and documents onto the
6854710 ainda bem que o flamengo ganhou mas tem tanto time perto do s o paulo que n o podemos nem pensar em empatar com o coritiba sen o fica complicado com todo o respeito vamos a curitiba para vencer

6854712 para vencer fora de casa tem de marcar o advers rio na press o n o tem como mudar o estilo ganhamos os outros campeonatos assim arriscando fora de casa e n o podemos nos preocupar com o gr mio temos antes que fazer a nossa parte
6854713 she was a very humanitarian person and she would not want anyone im sure condemned for this act
6854714 thanks to the sons of iraq the security situation in the rashid district improved and citizens are able to move back to normalcy in their daily lives
6854715 these soldiers continue to conduct full spectrum operations in the rashid district of southern baghdad
6854716 the withdrawal needs to take place and needs to take place now
6854717 there is no bread there is no food no medicine people are dying

6854719 the clerk remembered the defendant because he came in twice to pay for the movie since adult movies cost more
6854720 my office is disappointed he was not held to answer for the things he really did this man will continue to have access to children
6854721 a gas station attendant recalled him smelling of beer and saying a priest tried to rape him
6854722 the defendant lied claiming they were at church when the victim acted out
6854723 he abused his position of confidence and should be away from all minors
6854724 he needs to be placed somewhere where he cannot hurt those who trust in him
6854725 it is just not comfortable to be in a church anymore
6854726 he insisted that nothing like this has ever happened before and it will never happen again
6854727 the church lied to its members telling them it was alcohol related but not telling them about the child annoyance charge said tozzie the anaheim detective
6854728 we didnt hold anything back and we told parishioners exactly what happened
6854729 a total write off ofsovereigns gse preferred stock could be a material impact toearnings

6854739 to avoid the threat of catastrophic consequences in the future we need new policy approaches to change the direction and magnitude of drivers of environmental change and shift environmental policy making to the core of decision making
6854740 it will be an important milestone but it will be one step in what will undoubtedly be a long journey
6854741 while we deeply regret the circumstances surroundingindymacs failure we believe that there is insufficientevidence for us to investigate senator schumer at this time
6854742 while senator schumersstatements may have accelerated public concern about indymacsfinancial condition we do not believe that we can prove thatthey caused the banks failure
6854743 from the day schumers letterwas made public on june 26 until the closure of the bank a runon the bank took place and the failure became inevitable
6854744 the governmentspolicies encouraging leverage have been somehow directlyinvolved in this crisis
6854745 thats where we are today in the middle of a financialcrisis with the economy sliding into recession with monetarypolicy at maximum easing and fiscal transfers impotent

6854755 the poll suggests that frustration and disillusionment among social conservatives may be a part of the reason why a greater number now think that religious institutions should keep out of politics
6854756 the greatest increases since 2004 in the view that churches and other houses of worship should not express themselves on political matters have occurred among less educated republicans and people who say that social issues such as abortion and same sex marriage will be important to their vote
6854757 jerry could sell anything people will watch these jerry is rich successful everything that regular people want to be if this ad runs internationally it will have an even bigger impact
6854758 microsoft is already an established brand their software is unbeatable and to have seinfeld on the screen making a joke or two will just seal the deal and beat the apple ads
6854759 microsoft has strategic and operational problems with vista its perceived as too complicated and difficult to use the company also has perceptional problems
6854760 using seinfeld could be a brilliant move if he addresses some of the real issues in a funny way
6854761 when seinfelds show was a hit most of the mac buyers were watching cartoons
6854762 his persona is more of an apple guy anyway and in the show he even had an old square mac on the back desk
6854763 despite some of the best marketing support in the industry you cant undo that image with frankly he appeals to me but im 53 years old and i am not switching to macs
6854764 however the next generation of computer buyers want macs and their ad campaign has reenforced it with the 18 to 24 and the 24 to 30 demographic groups

6854767 walking into the coliseum is a very special experience i want the players to see that

6854772 i dont have much but i want my grandson to have a better future
6854773 near everyone i speak with is fed up with albany
6854774 our campaign has attracted supporters who like me want to achieve the goal of reforming albany from within by winning this election
6854775 it is wrong for the law to permit wealthy donors to give senate candidates up to 15 500
6854776 we wont see legislation for issues like universal health insurance until we remove the big money influence from albany through publicly funded elections our campaign is as close to a publicly funded election as they come
6854777 we are in a global economy i think most people recognize that
6854778 there is no going back now and what we should be doing as a country is focusing on how we as americans define the global economy
6854779 i was heartened by ricardo ricc s admission and earnest apology for his mistake
6854780 wow i hope my son turns out like that if i have a boy
6854781 unfortunately there are examples of serious fires starting and in apartment complexes you have a lot of families living close together
6854782 are they going to have barbecue police going around and looking at barbecues on balconies no
6854783 but for some apartment owners with wood decked balconies its not a bad thing to do in the spirit of safety and for your residents
6854784 we do go to fires caused by barbecues on balconies
6854785 we may go to a few of these every year
6854786 fred was taking over samples and drawings to show what his concept was i drove him over there
6854787 it was at a period when fred was transitioning from studio and gallery art to doing a lot more public commissions
6854788 i saw him working on the pieces i was his assistant for the one in rancho murieta
6854789 there is no doubt in my mind as a matter of law nothing that is said in this courtroom could be used in camp pendleton period
6854790 why is it the one person who could sign it wont do it
6854791 sono terrorizzato da te e vorrei che mi lasciassi stare
6854792 i miei amici non hanno visto la vera india e non ci stiamo incontrando in una conferenza nel cuore della vera india

6854800 the west needs to recognize that the free to play model is the future before its too late
6854801 the free to play microtransaction and ad supported model has found huge success
6854802 given the passage of time we have to validate the assumptions used in the model to support our offer price of 25 74 per share in cash
6854803 in addition we no longer believe we can integrate take two ahead of the important holiday season
6854804 xbox is a natural partner to help us reach out to youth voters
6854805 to realize our goal of registering 2 million young americans by this fall we need to go where young americans are and theres no doubt in our minds that many are on xbox 360 and xbox live
6854806 identify the emergency and work as one large team to protect and save lives and mitigate the hazards
6854807 they knew it was a cbrn chemical biological radioactive or nuclear event
6854808 and that it was a terrorist event they dont know what the chemical is they have to decide based on what they find and what they heard
6854809 it would be a challenge but if the community wanted it we would plan and find the resources to do it
6854810 its difficult to have the level of seriousness you would have in a real situation
6854811 they might be feeling a little frustrated and a little awkward about standing around
6854812 but we want to keep everybody safe and its sometimes difficult to simulate that
6854813 we take the sample over to our mobile laboratory and if theyre not able to determine what it is theyll take it over to lawrence livermore
6854814 the scenario was this a terrorist with a backpack full of sodium cyanide a chemical used in gold mines
6854815 im glad we got to this point but i dont want to breath until its all over
6854816 having demonstrated its ability to play a strong defense management now must in our view demonstrate that it can play offense
6854817 it must fill attractive stores with compelling and inspiring merchandise and then use every tool to drive the customer back to into the stores
6854818 the trajectory of our traffic in our business is unacceptable

6854864 with the boys sons tyrone and conor here ive got to be on my best behavior and my attitude is just pretty good
6854865 ive taken a lot of pressure off myself and feel comfortable ive been playing well and im in a good position now
6854866 i need to play well this week and next week and so far this week ive done that
6854867 if nick then feels i am worthy of a pick so be it if not then thats acceptable
6854868 i dont think i have led after two rounds before but i have been close and maybe not pressed on enough to the weekend
6854869 i have maybe shot level or one under and that isnt good enough i have to try and shoot the same sort of scores over the weekend that i have for the first two days here and i will have a good chance to win
6854870 i love playing in the wind its fun but today was calmer and i managed to score well again i was third here last year and had a chance but ross fisher played great in the last round but i just think this place looks great and plays great
6854871 today our weekend got off to a good start but obviously it is far too early to say where we are compared to the opposition
6854872 the setup we have found today is not bad but there is still plenty of room for improvement
6854873 the first day was difficult for everybody especially to get the braking points its very hard on breaks
6854874 we keep improving the car race after race and we are in a position now to be in the top six in qualifiers and in the races to get points
6854875 considering the dustiness of the track we made a very promising start on the setup this morning
6854876 we were able to go quicker on each run without changing too much and we took a very good baseline into the afternoon session were in pretty good shape and im looking forward to tomorrow
6854877 the track was very green this morning which meant there was little point in making big changes to the car
6854878 in the afternoon we made a number of changes which seemed to pay off for us by the end of the session the car was working well and the balance felt really good todays progress was very encouraging
6854879 i could only drag my leg around the house something told me urgent action was required i had micro surgery on friday morning this is the fifth time ive gone under the scalpel and each time i think its miraculous i can now walk again slowly without the drag but its going to take at least six months of physiotherapy before i start to walk more normally again

6854887 obama has made his advances based on the successes of others whove come before him
6854888 those numbers look like the numbers for electing a black president did 40 or 50 years ago

6854890 for good or for ill i think the ellen phenomenon has made the domesticated lesbian more palatable
6854891 i think it would be a partnered lesbian probably someone with children
6854892 i think that women have more successfully bridged the yuck gap with the public than men
6854893 it would have to be someone who in that particular elocution happened to be gay
6854894 im not sure if obama shows us a new way of becoming president so much as he is an exceptional personality with an exceptional biography in an exceptional time
6854895 by the time were ready to consider a gay president
6854896 gay rights will have to have almost ceased being controversial in america

6854906 the withdrawal is not happening very quickly if it in fact has begun the withdrawal needs to take place and needs to take place now
6854907 russia is in violation of the commitments they have made
6854908 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6854909 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around

6854922 to respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
6854923 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
6854924 the details of who did what to precipitate russias war against georgia are not very important
6854925 i dont know why he would give this statement unless he just misunderstood or misremembered
6854926 i said well you cant be with our program youve put our program in harms way
6854927 i never even went into his office to sign any papers dealing with this whole incident
6854928 ive never been to coach pruetts office period as far as anything dealing with a job hes never approached me about a job
6854929 i may not have understood everything that i did sign off on
6854930 my brother was dying of cancer i wanted to see him
6854931 my grandson was a junior in high school i wanted to watch him play i wanted to help my son coach it was just time it was of my own volition
6854932 this is great you and tom are all over the tabloids
6854933 uh its not just in the papers its on the television too its hot news
6854934 today in pop news mcfly lead singer tom fletcher was seen yesterday with an unidentified young lady the two were seen at jims hardware store holding hands and looking for paint colors sources say the two were holding hands the whole time could this be new romance for the singer all i know is teenage girls all over england will be once again getting their hearts crushed as he is no longer single more on this story later tom is one lucky man this girl is fit julie i bet you ten pounds she is a crazed fan he met at some signing or something
6854935 i knew i liked those boots for a reason they look great on camera not as cheap as they actually were plus that guy just lost ten pounds ha
6854936 so what are you guys going to tell the press they hunted us down for weeks until they got the whole scoop
6854937 uh i have no idea i didnt realize they would grab onto it as fast as they did to be honest
6854938 well youre going to have to tell them something plus you guys have an interview with top of the pops tomorrow this is bound to come up
6854939 well i dont really care to be honest tom whatever you want to tell them or not tell them is fine with me
6854940 uh are you kidding it looks like we are on the balcony of your room in
6854941 of course just tell me when you want me over there what you want the mural of and where and i will be there
6854942 you know you could make a job out of this because i want one too rich people would pay loads for these kinds of things in their houses
6854943 i dont think i know im a personal shopper for the a list crowd you know that way they dont have to get bombarded by the paparazzi while trying to get their kid cheerios but they love stuff like this artsy stuff if you want i could spread the word to some of my clients they would pay big bucks for this kind of thing
6854944 i would love that wait is that how you met danny
6854945 no i met steph when we were still doing opening gigs she was working for a client who wanted a new band for his daughters sixteenth birthday we auditioned got the part and i asked her out at the party the rest is history really
6854946 wow is right man i stood her for five minutes watching that
6854947 danny honey its ok dont be so nervous ive never seen you like this
6854948 you have to promise not to tell the guys im not ready to tell them i need a girls point of view first
6854949 i think im going to ask steph to marry me and i need your help
6854950 well i have a plan to take her where we had our first date i need you to help me get her there and help her get ready without it being too suspicious can you do that
6854951 uh next friday i need you to help her find something really hot yet kinda comfortable our first date was a picnic so its not like she needs a ball gown
6854952 well what are your plans for today having a star wars marathon or something
6854953 nope nothing that exciting we have an interview with top of the pops but we have been there loads of times we are playing our new single
6854954 ugh well i guess i will have to let go of you then
6854955 you dont have to i just have to shave and that wont take long they do our hair and stuff there
6854956 hmmm tom said something about that why would i be nervous though im not getting interviewed
6854957 yea but they will probably ask tom about your relationship after this interview the paparazzi will be hunting you down
6854958 algo novo aconteceu comigo algo novo mudou tudo em mim eis me aqui pra ser purificado

6854960 he was taken to the hospital for long term intoxication and withdrawal from alcohol
6854961 that altercation took place after jail personnel observed mathes behaving irrationally in his cell
6854962 he was becoming increasingly agitated and displaying signs of angry aggression
6854963 when an inmate is causing problems that may cause him harm its important we put them in an environment where they cant do that
6854964 they have a right and responsibility to use force when necessary
6854965 the mans health was going down he wouldnt pose a real threat
6854966 fasten your seat belts kids its going to be a bumpy night
6854967 when we abandon the city i really believe that we compromise our communitys future
6854968 and memphis continues to be the second most segregated city in the country
6854969 we are really in a critical state on infant mortality
6854970 we have children having children and they need to know that somebody is there to walk beside them and we never know what some of these children have been through themselves you really just have no idea where theyve been
6854971 i talked to karen durham and she said hey weve got a young lady that weve been working with for a long time and shes pregnant and i would love for you to work with her
6854972 we send missionaries all over the world to help people in dire situations and this is something right here in my hometown thats just on the other side of memphis and its something i can do
6854973 whenever i call her shell come by to help me shes great
6854974 precious is very brave because i was that strange white lady calling her and saying i dont know you but lets get together you know lets go out and lets talk
6854975 you know coming up with topics of conversation at first was a little bit awkward
6854976 but at the same time shes a girl just like my daughters and we talk about things we talked about boys we talked about friends and thats the same regardless of what color somebody is
6854977 she wasnt going to the doctor as she was supposed to
6854978 the situation hasnt changed much at all wherever there is a high concentration of afro americans washington d c memphis tennessee new orleans you name it there is a higher infant mortality rate so is it a racial issue it seems to be preponderant among black babies this proclivity to death
6854979 the county offers this service and most people gonna take it because they do not have money to go to a private cemetery
6854980 we do as better job as we can because we giving those bodies back to god
6854981 this is a great cemetery and i have seen it over the years just explode just explode with burying people
6854982 its so risky i dont care about curly hair or blue eyes green eyes as long as shes healthy thats all my main concern is a healthy baby cause you see so much nowadays yep so much
6854983 the inner city is like the most stressful place i think the crime rate is too high you see too much things goes on in the neighborhood
6854984 stress plays a major role in pregnancy if youre stressed out a lot you can easily have a miscarriage i know several people who have lost their child due to a miscarriage my friend tonya she lost her child like a couple of weeks ago she lost her child
6854985 they gave me like two pictures of my baby and stuff and they let me hold my baby i really wanted my baby
6854986 its something that you live with forever the loss of your unborn child
6854987 but still we have the pregnancies we have the babies so we need to take care of them we need to talk to them and we need to educate the young moms about taking care of their child and also about birth control and about abstinence
6854988 i think that there are a lot of assumptions that you make we make about people who are poor and unless you have spent time and interacted with people who are poor you have no idea what their lives are like
6854989 people who are poor in my experience dont have that same feeling of entitlement to quality housing to buses that run near where they live to a grocery store that even has produce that you would want to eat
6854990 and all these things compound upon each other to create a cycle and a system of poverty that seems it can seem inescapable
6854991 i try not to let it get to me so much but its not a day go by that i dont think about where hes at and why would he walk out on me now you know this is a big time when you need your father the most to help support you
6854992 and if thats the way they can get it then thats the way they can get it because i do believe a lot of the relationships are very casual first date second date
6854993 its not a little couple thats been going together necessarily a long time you know having a long term relationship
6854994 it could be something that they just meet up and have sex and i think that goes back to there not being any men in a lot of the childrens lives
6854995 i want this day to be the day when the people of memphis and the people of the state of tennessee stood up together and said were not going to be silent were not going to stand aside as one more child dies in vain
6854996 its a very sad reality that infant deaths dont seem to get the priority often that some of the other high profile newsworthy six and 10 oclock news stories do get
6854997 when you really think about it that infant deaths in this nation account for more deaths than all of the other causes of death combined for children up to the age of 18 we should be marching we should be absolutely indignant about those numbers
6854998 ive been going to meetings about this with just chest beating and programs and so on
6854999 but what we need to realize and i think that we finally do youre looking at infant mortality as a manifestation of the accumulated social inadequacies that we have tolerated historically and we happen to be tackling infant mortality
6855000 there is so much else in that picture ranging all the way from the proper lifestyle and diet to the proper education and life itself
6855001 if youre on welfare and you dont know where your next meal is coming from and you have to walk wherever it is because you cant buy the gas or whatever those things are your chances of having a healthy baby are diminished in this community when a premature baby is born society has failed
6855002 the only time i met the babys father was at the hospital the night that bryanna was born
6855003 and he would talk so ugly to her when she early on in her pregnancy she would tell me some of the things that hed say i mean it was pretty a rough relationship
6855004 he dont care about nothing but his car rims money
6855005 but you know i aint going to hold no grudge against him if he ever feel like he want to straighten up and be there for the baby he can but you know theres nothing more between me and him there can never be anymore us but if he ever feel like he wants to come see the baby ill let him see her
6855006 i think she very much wants him to be a father but she aint going to say that because that makes her weak
6855007 that makes her something that she doesnt want to be thats just women women are very strong around here they are very strong or at least give you the appearance of it
6855008 so they will raise that child with or without that man but i dont think the thought process is any different as to everybody wants her child to have a mom and a dad and grandparents and all those things i dont care who you are
6855009 im going to tell her the good stuff about him and the bad stuff i think everybody should know you know about their parents
6855010 i sent out an apb all points bulletin across the city please help me we need maternity clothes she said
6855011 i had one donation of maternity clothes i had trouble getting pampers so imagine trying to get 60 000 70 000 a 100 000 grant
6855012 i think the bottom line more so than race is finances
6855013 what am i going to get back if i put all this money into this inner city indigent program are they going to come out and vote for me are they going to do the things thats going to make me get to where i want to be its the human race and basically its a selfish race
6855014 im happy for tyler because he gets to compete his senior year
6855015 en el tren si me dorm y el revisor tuvo que despertarme a golpes estaba reventado del viaje
6855016 this might shock the epmu but we think people do have rights
6855017 we first need to realize that such actions will have consequences and if these consequences outweigh the initial threat proposed by global warming then the best course of action would be to just get out of the way and to try not make things worse by starving people and shipwrecking economies in the name of environmentalism

6855019 a view of the bay is worth half the pay
6855020 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
6855021 there are four committees and how they relate to each other will come forward very shortly
6855022 although defendants believe that they would ultimately have prevailed at a trial the costs of going forward weighed in favor of a settlement at this time
6855023 i found out i could get arrested for absolutely no reason
6855024 all of a sudden from the fifth avenue side a huge number of police officers entered 56th street
6855025 the protest was on the south side of the street we were standing on the north side of the street they came directly to us they were in riot gear and they surrounded us they made a semicircle around us shoulder to shoulder with their batons
6855026 then they started arresting us one by one at that point i got emotional i could not believe in my country in my city i could get arrested for doing absolutely nothing and standing on the sidewalk
6855027 this settlement was reached without any admission of liability on behalf of the city and the individual defendants
6855028 are you telling me that my sons safety is at stake b c you are responsible to keep him safe
6855029 no were just saying its like a turf thing to the other boy hes been here for a long time amp trent is new
6855030 so youre telling me the other boy who you are admitting is violent amp prone to attacking others has more of a right to be here than trent
6855031 we are indeed distressed that our previous analysis of this issue was in error
6855032 i cant provide odds on whether dropped votes were not recognized
6855033 but based on what we know about how our customers run their elections and reconcile counts we believe any results not uploaded on election night would have been caught when elections were being certified
6855034 voters in jurisdictions premier serves both in ohio and throughout the country can be assured that election officials employing standard canvass and crosscheck procedures will count their votes completely and accurately
6855035 as far as i know we have not seen that problem
6855036 pro hockey life is an exciting opportunity to change the hockey retailing market in canada we want to present consumers whether male female professional or amateur with all of the gear they could ever possibly need all under one roof
6855037 consumers will no longer have to travel from one general sports outlet to another to find appropriate hockey equipment
6855038 but dont look for womens gear in a separate section at pro hockey life we cater to one clientele hockey enthusiasts period
6855039 we believe pro hockey life is the largest concept of its kind in the world and are very excited to be able to combine an interactive shopping experience with all of the equipment any hockey enthusiast could ever need
6855040 they persuaded me that there is always time to serve my country and that maybe i would be able to serve even better if i went to college first
6855041 i hardly doubt that its a coincidence that these schools are prospering at a time of war
6855042 inner city kids many from broken homes found stability and role models in junior rotc they got a taste of discipline the work ethic and they experienced pride of membership in something healthier than a gang junior rotc is a social bargain
6855043 students have to make the choice on their own to be here
6855044 were aiming at kids who arent in trouble but who arent fully realizing their potential either
6855045 we often see kids who have all the makings of being good students but have very unstable home lives because of economics and family structures we can make a difference in these students lives
6855046 before i would have to spend so much time as disciplinarian
6855047 i dont have behavior problems and on the rare occasion that something does happen its somebody elses job to take care of not mine
6855048 look at this when you were in school did you ever see it so calm
6855049 i like that we could become leaders and we know every student no bullies none of that so its real cool
6855050 its not like we have been given an enlistment quota here
6855051 liberal school administrators and teachers claimed that we were trying to militarize education yes ill admit the armed forces might get a youngster more inclined to enlist as a result of junior rotc but society got a far greater payoff
6855052 it would be really naive to think that the military would in fact be expanding these schools and these programs and pouring millions of dollars into the schools at a time when they actually are having a recruitment crisis if the schools were not about recruiting students
6855053 if the defense department is looking to us for recruitment then they are making a bad investment
6855054 find a way to make the attributes of the military model generic can it be done without the military we need to find a way to help the struggling youth of america without funding from the military
6855055 so many of these schools are so new and they claim that its too early to tell whether a school is successful so why are we still building them if we dont know
6855056 we have seen small schools projects be successful and the successes that are related to the military academies are in line with that
6855057 but there doesnt seem to be anything inherent to the military academies that leads us to say now theyve got the answer
6855058 the wealthier families in cities have the advantage of sending their children to private schools and a certain portion will go to the better public schools but in cities we know we are facing a particular demographic
6855059 if the military branches are formally involved as sponsors operators and funders
6855060 it is naive to expect them to resist the temptation to use these programs as a recruitment pipeline if anything given global conditions the pressure on them to do so probably will intensify instead of subside
6855061 chelsea have a great squad a great team and their offer is good for me and for the team
6855062 it isnt because of money it is simply because i want to leave my personal aim is to be the best player in the world and that isnt going to be possible at real madrid
6855063 ive finished my cycle ive played three seasons at real madrid and have given everything
6855064 i have scored goals won two leagues and that isnt easy i think my period at real madrid has come to an end
6855065 i hope the directors reach an agreement with chelsea to resolve my situation as quickly as possible
6855066 it would be harmful if he stayed at the club and wasnt happy about it because it would be bad for his career

6855082 at the moment we give people an outlet for their frustration
6855083 these arent stunts these are emergency calls this is us sounding the alarm about something everyone is aware of family breakdown mass fatherlessness is a problem in this country but politicians dont seem to recognise it
6855084 people were caught in traffic for 90 minutes thats a click of the fingers compared to a man separated from his kids for a week a month a year

6855100 yes i want to play in the nfl thats what ive always dreamt about doing i cant picture myself doing anything else i cant imagine working a real job
6855101 id rather play the game and get paid to do it
6855102 if for whatever reason it didnt work out i still would be very pleased to have come here ive had a great time
6855103 youve got to have a break youve got to have a team that needs your style of play and you have to go out and perform
6855104 i use it to excite myself and go out and work harder
6855105 hes a big enough kid there are a lot of good quarterbacks that just arent big enough
6855106 hes got the physical tools hes been productive hes smart and a good leader i think hes got the ability to be a very good backup in the nfl
6855107 i do think hell excel in the system we try and put together for him and i think he has the ability to perform at a high level
6855108 because were from such a small school nationally speaking and havent had anybody since kitna make it to the nfl this is fairly new grounds for central to have scouts coming through here like that

6855113 when you minister here remember that you are talking to people who have a deep connection to history and the history of the church here is not a good one for them remember that our history is one where faith and politics were often linked together and the result was very painful so when we hear american politicians using religious language we get very nervous remember to be patient
6855114 however lgbtq youth frequently face additional pressures based on their gender identity or sexual orientation
6855115 the majority of lgbtq youth report alcohol and drug use as common mechanisms for coping with feelings of severe isolation
6855116 clinicians should help lgbtq youth explore their feelings about their gender identity or sexual orientation along with related issues and questions in a safe affirming manner clinicians should help youth reduce co occurring problems or distress related to their gender identity or sexual orientation and develop their strengths coping skills and resiliency

6855118 i believe the number of juveniles was deliberately reduced this year and the kids sent elsewhere
6855119 young people who are a danger to themselves and their communities
6855120 for most of the kids we dont need these facilities and we dont need to be shipping them hundreds of miles away from their families
6855121 that money can be reinvested in programs that work better for these young people
6855122 the police say that juvenile arrests are up by 8 percent in new york city
6855123 even after i close the facilities i will have 20 to 30 percent excess capacity so i have the flexibility in the system
6855124 this is the alternative boarding school system for children of color we can do better than this
6855125 instead of continuing to pour money into this broken system and confining these children to facilities hundreds of miles from their homes
6855126 ocfs has aggressively been moving toward more community based alternatives to incarceration where these children can maintain and strengthen connections with their families and the significant adults in their lives

6855128 it was hard for me to transition back to the community when i was upstate
6855129 were here today to support the new york state office of children and family services plan to close six underutilized youth facilities
6855130 the senate has proposed keeping open the auburn youth facility the brace youth facility and the great valley youth facility
6855131 we are in a fiscal situation where the state has to close a gap of between four and five billion
6855132 meanwhile the department has to maintain facilities when in some instances you have two children and 25 or 26 staff
6855133 you know what happens when we put young people upstate 81 percent of the boys reoffend within three years
6855134 three would be kept open for a number of factors including economic factors and we are trying to find alternative uses for the facilities

6855136 we need to relieve the burden on the va from routine health care
6855137 if you have a routine health care need take it wherever you want whatever doctor or health care provider and get the treatment you need while we at the va focus our attention our care our love on these grievous wounds of war
6855138 received consistently better care across the board including screening diagnosis treatment and follow up
6855139 ideologues like john mccain and george bush hate the fact that the va exists
6855140 they hate the fact that theres a functional example out there of the government providing better care at a lower cost than the private sector
6855141 the problem that the va faces now is that the bush administration failed to hire enough doctors and disability claims adjusters when they chose to go to war with iraq if these doctors had been hired the va would be an example of the government doing good work bush and mccain dont want the public to see that
6855142 if im driving a humvee in iraq and a roadside bomb explodes and i veer off the road and crush my arm and end up losing it and needing a prosthetic is that a combat wound according to sen mccain
6855143 if mccain would work to properly fund va care there would be no issue about a va card
6855144 mccain by wanting to give vets private care is walking away from the va and ignoring the problem
6855145 for every vet who would get a va card that would be one less vet using the va
6855146 would mean in a short period of time a smaller budget fewer locations and the eventual dismantling of the best health care system in the country

6855155 these guys are working under incredibly tight deadlines and there are situations where theyre panicking
6855156 we can really say weve made significant inroads in this segment
6855157 particularly in delivering a quick editing workflow that can truly keep up with these guys
6855158 you see what these guys really need and what they go through and as a product manager its been amazing to spend that much time absorbing how people respond to our current product its worth more than a big stack of market research papers just to be able to work with these photographers

6855331 after a hectic few weeks of taking over i think we are starting to get there now macaulays result this weekend was a positive sign that we as a team are becoming more of a force and i am sure that there are more results to come in the future
6855332 practice went well and id qualified on pole but a problem meant that i was forced to start from the back of the grid once the heats got underway and i knew then that i would have to drive hard all weekend
6855333 my heats went well and i was hoping to be able to go for the win in the second final but there was nothing i could do about the guy in front of me and his engine problem once id got past him the leader was just out of reach but its great for all of the team to come straight back to a podium finish and we will be aiming for more of the same at every race for the rest of the season
6855334 in my second heat carl ran me wide and i lost places he apologised later though but i was then hit by the same driver who drove me off the circuit in the first race
6855335 im now 2nd in the championship after starting the weekend in 4th place overall and im very happy its all coming together at the right time
6855336 i was running in 2nd place but my engine developed a problem mid way through the race i couldnt pull maximum revs on the straights and dropped to 4th which i guess wasnt too bad in the end but i had been game on for a podium
6855337 im quick at larkhall and my win at genk was a big confidence booster im quietly confident

6855400 so folks it has been quite awhile since a proper update on whats going on weve been mostly taking summer off which is why theres been little to report but we are revving into full gear for the fall so its time to let you in on whats up our collective sleeves
6855401 first up to deck is our upcoming european tour with our trusted and talented labelmates torche
6855402 coinciding with that tour will be some new merch goodies can anyone say limited edition split 10
6855403 also as previously announced we will have copies of the fire in our throats on double lp in a repressed edition courtesy of our friends at viva hate records

6855405 when i said that we took the summer off well i kind of lied we did get together to work on new material including a song called inch above sand which we recorded for an upcoming split 7
6855406 actually the song already made its live debut in chicago a couple of weeks ago at our last minute show at the subterranean
6855407 but i would be remiss if i were to tell you that this was the only video recording going on in our summer as we spent a couple of days with our buddy kenneth in sunny los angeles shooting the music video for lost in the headlights
6855408 but the additional costs of working there will likely cancel out the tax credit cost savings
6855409 the problem is that this takes away good business from us here and now

6855605 a strange feature of the deist controversy is the apparent acceptance of all parties of the conviction of the existence of god
6855606 by utilizing his wide classical learning blount demonstrated how to use pagan writers and pagan ideas against christianity other deists were to follow his lead
6855607 from the end of the 1690s when the vehement response to john tolands christianity not mysterious 1696 started the deist debate to the end of the 1740s when the tepid response to middletons free inquiry signalized its close
6855608 became very soon after its publication the focal center of the deist controversy because almost every argument quotation and issue raised for decades can be found here the work is often termed the deists bible
6855609 god designed all mankind should at all times know what he wills them to know believe profess and practice and has given them no other means for this but the use of reason
6855610 travelled well as deism waned in england it waxed in france and the german states
6855611 some books against deism fell into my hands they were said to be the substance of sermons preached at boyles lectures it happened that they wrought an effect on me quite contrary to what was intended by them for the arguments of the deists which were quoted to be refuted appeared to me much stronger than the refutations in short i soon became a thorough deist

6855617 given the epidemic of obesity in the us and the frequent use of statins the positive association we observed raises substantial concern as to the safety of these widely prescribed agents
6855618 we also found no evidence that use of a statin was associated with risk of developing more aggressive subtypes of prostate caner
6855619 overall we found no support for the current hypothesis that statin use may reduce risk of prostate cancer
6855620 current use of a statin was associated with a 50 percent increase in risk of prostate cancer and use for 5 or more years was associated with an 80 percent increase in risk of the disease both of these risk estimates were statistically significant

6855623 we are excited about entering into this partnership with wheeling jesuit university

6855626 the solutions to the problems we will face in this challenge require a unique set of skills this collaboration will enable students to combine the unique learning experience that distinguishes wheeling jesuit university with the exceptional technical learning in engineering and mineral sciences for which wvu is well known
6855627 our state and our society as a whole are in need of highly educated scientists and engineers to solve the problems that we face and to fill the high tech jobs of the future
6855628 by increasing educational options for students in programs like this we enhance our ability to fulfill this vision

6855651 we were looking for a way for the university to engage freshmen in research
6855652 weve seen there are huge benefits both personal and academic when a student gets involved in a discipline like this it brings to life what theyre learning in the classroom and helps them make those connections
6855653 by engaging in theses activities with faculty we believe that we not only provide experience but also develop connections within the university that will increase retention
6855654 they would always say how they wished they could have gotten into something like mcnair scholars sooner like when they were freshmen or sophomores
6855655 so this is a way for incoming students to get a better sense of their intended major early in their career its a way for them to get into their discipline earlier and build relationships with faculty upper level students and grad students in their field
6855656 there are discussions going on right now and we are putting together a public statement

6855885 such flash based solid state drives are already available in some computers available on the market including the macbook air though the drives used in these products havent been produced by intel
6855886 dubbed the intel high performance sata solid state drive product line the data storage devices are aimed at mobile and desktop clients as well as enterprise server storage and workstation applications the first products in the new line are slated to be available by mid september
6855887 the announcement was made tuesday at the companys intel developer forum in san francisco
6855888 phonenews com can confirm that apple is preparing to release an new revision of the macbook air while that in and of itself is not a surprise to many we can confirm some of the specifications of the unit
6855889 much of the macbook airs external design will not change
6855890 the new macbook air however will trade that cpu out for a standard penryn class core2 duo
6855891 apples first revision to the macbook air will see a clock speed boost as well as a storage upgrade according to a newly prominent rumor
6855892 however this swap will allegedly create a power increase and require that apple supply the system with a 60 watt power supply rather than the smaller 45 watt unit that comes with the existing model the internal design is described as closer to that of the standard macbook though whether it will be based on some components of intels centrino 2 platform or use a rumored custom design is unknown

6856058 as a team owner in the nascar nationwide series its really exciting to see the activation nationwide insurance has developed around their sponsorship
6856059 plus we had a great time doing the burn outs for the commercial to promote the sweepstakes
6856060 trabajo mucho y como sano y me siento muy c moda con lo que hago vengo de una familia europea y siempre estuvimos muy c modos con nuestros cuerpos todo el mundo tiene cosas que no les gusta
6856061 t eres lo que eres como mujer nunca he reclamado para tener un cuerpo perfecto es lo que es
6856062 these are some of the boldest changes weve ever made
6856063 it is a shift in the business model for our sellers and for ebay we are asking sellers to rethink their listing strategies and giving them
6856064 we are really recognizing e commerce in general and what our buyers are seeing anywhere else online
6856065 it is going to make the process faster and more reliable
6856066 we think auctions really work for unique items rare items hard to find items or one of a kind in demand items
6856067 we are shifting most of the fees onto the back end but we think that with the change in our listing fee we are extremely competitive
6856068 the goal is to be the most competitively priced site on the web
6856069 amazon has been cutting pretty heavily into ebay sales and amazons growth has been going phenomenally
6856070 i think the bloom is off the auction a bit by and large people want to be able to go in and get things quickly
6856071 in the end a regular commerce site came in and found a way to steal ebays thunder
6856072 ebay is bleeding and its going to have to step up and stem the bleeding

6856102 leaving the person out of the credits could be a mistake im not saying its not happening
6856103 i just dont know who the heck this person is
6856104 in some of the cases that people left some of them hadnt done a great job for us or some left just in a lurch do i feel badly for that no i dont feel badly at all im not going to shed a single tear for any of those guys
6856105 online games are ever changing and have ever changing credits show me one mmog that has been up for seven years that has kept the credits for every single person whos worked on the game as long as theyve had a large team
6856106 we have hundreds of people working on warhammer and whats going to happen a year from now is maybe some of that team goes on to another game and we bring in other people to replace them and then what happens the year after that or the year after that if we set that precedent right now that anyone who worked on the game at any point in time is going to be in the credits the credits will be 20 pages long within a couple of years and nobody does that
6856107 you know what if people want to complain about credits then how come were not tracking the months how come we dont have the five star credit section for people who worked on it for three years then the four star credit section and then the two star credit
6856108 there are so many issues with it and we want to keep it really simple if youre on the team when we launch youre in the full credits section with some exceptions into the special thanks for certain people who have left under difficult circumstances
6856109 there is no requirement to have credits a lot of companies dont give any credits but we do if all the game companies agree on something even internally theres no absolute plan within ea because its up to the studios on that day ill be thrilled
6856110 until then everyone who is currently at mythic whos worked on warhammer workers not credited

6856114 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6856115 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

6856124 but if youre going to fail you have to fail on your own mistakes i sit down and write the book and prefer they dont ask me any questions until the book is finished
6856125 i dont work out i swim occasionally i have a nice pool but really work is my hobby because i really love what i do i think if you wake up in the morning and love what you do it makes a big difference in your life

6856145 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up

6856148 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

6856171 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6856172 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6856173 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6856174 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6856175 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical

6856240 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel

6856247 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6856248 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6856249 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6856250 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

6856256 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

6856258 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6856259 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6856260 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6856261 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6856262 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6856263 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6856264 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6856265 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6856266 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6856267 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6856268 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6856269 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6856270 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6856271 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6856272 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6856273 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6856274 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6856275 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6856276 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6856277 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6856278 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6856279 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6856280 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6856281 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6856282 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6856283 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6856284 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6856285 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6856286 i was asked to do strictly this year i did think about it i really have a passion for the show it would look so rotten so wrong for me to do it this year maybe next year
6856287 the dancing show looks like such a great show it seems such a great show to work on
6856288 for programme makers reality tv is cheap unless of course you ask me to do it its very cheap
6856289 a lot of the shows which are filmed in peoples homes arent reality
6856290 it definitely is not put on its very emotional you have a huge responsibility to people believe me its as real as it can be for good and for bad
6856291 there are times on the x factor that you wish you could take back what youve done but its live tv you can never take it back its too late
6856292 believe me id much rather be doing this than watching a band perform at three in the morning so im in yeah
6856293 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6856294 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6856295 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6856296 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6856297 i dont take things so seriously when it comes to fashion were not curing cancer were making clothing
6856298 i cant really talk about it because im under contract
6856299 i watched the first movie several times and i did watch some gilmore girls
6856300 id done a lot of theater growing up so this tv show was just one of the many things that ive done obviously i had to become aware of the fact that it became the most popular show in england and across europe that was a bit of a struggle to deal with in a way
6856301 rudy loved lechon theres going to be one at the reception afterwards
6856302 in truth barack obama senior obamas father was a polygamist who had already abandoned one wife and child in africa when he met obamas mother in hawaii after being educated at harvard obama senior returned to africa abandoning obama and his mother to live the life of a chronic alcoholic who ultimately killed himself in his second drink induced car accident while driving drunk on the streets of nairobi
6856303 you are part of the rebel alliance and a traitor taker her away
6856304 im already pregnant so what other shenanigans could i get into
6856305 a pair of kerouacs armed with sharpies and erasers and righteous indignation
6856306 just putting those school clothes back on and getting back into the ring can be an adjustment for some kids
6856307 especially if theyre changing schools or moving from a lower to an upper or middle to an upper school there can be a period of adjustment
6856308 my sons an introvert but if you ask him something hell tell you so kids will talk to you if you ask the right way dont assume that just because theyre not saying anything everything is alright ask because you need to know whats going on
6856309 the anti vaccination movement is based on irrational fears and is absolutely destructive
6856310 vaccines are mainly for the sake of the herd but no one cares about the community however if you want to protect the entire population you have to vaccinate
6856311 i cant say that every kid who doesnt get vaccinated will get the measles
6856312 it really depends on where you live but vaccines are pretty well regulated and drug makers arent making a lot of money on them contrary to popular belief getting vaccinated is basically for the public good
6856313 parents need to know that the internet can be disinhibiting to young people and adults alike
6856314 and people do things on the internet they wouldnt do in daily life they offer information they wouldnt normally offer in an interpersonal interaction thats more human
6856315 you literally need to warn them that what they do on the internet is real
6856316 ive had teenage patients who have sent naked photos or partially naked photos to boyfriends and if those things get passed around it can carry a terrible stigma and lead to bullying both in and out of school parents need to warn youths that if they do something thats inappropriate it places them at risk
6856317 bullying is bullying whether its done on the internet or in person and it has significant emotional ramifications
6856318 so children need to know that they can come to their parents anytime anyone makes them feel unsafe
6856319 when somebody is bullied it often means that they have sensitivities that someone else believes are valuable
6856320 the first step is defining the problem assessing what is happening and going quickly to the students teacher and let them know whats happening
6856321 parents need to be the first line of defense and take bullying very seriously if they have a relationship with the other childs parents they may want to reach out in a confidential way
6856322 sexual behavior between teens and adolescents is more common that most of us appreciated in the past
6856323 so its important for parents to share with their child that self respect involves your body too and there are risks to sexual contact
6856324 you have to give them a twofold message that the risk of pregnancy exists and theres also the tremendous risk of stds including hiv and this is important because hiv education is one of those things that has receded yet its just as important as ever
6856325 we have very large percentages of kids using drugs or alcohol and that should be something that every parent is talking to every child about
6856326 these are pervasive in most towns and cities in america and kids need to know that youre relying on them to not break the law at all when it comes to the use of illicit drugs and yet its so commonplace that young people try these things you also have to let them know that there will never be a time when youre not willing to listen when they need to talk
6856327 what we want is for kids to experience all the varied emotions that go with maturing and feeling competent and to be able to navigate the choppy waters that go with that
6856328 and alcohol and drugs dont make that any easier also we know that violent crime and many indiscretions take place in the presence of alcohol and drugs
6856329 there was an interesting study done in japan over a 25 year period during the 1960s to the 1980s it was done at a time when the flu and other vaccines were mandatory and what they found was that during that period the mortality rate due to the flu was down a million and the rate of respiratory illness were down over 200 000 so that shows you how important vaccines are
6856330 getting kids to wash their hands more can be done but its difficult
6856331 it would require a complete mindset change so for now the best we can do is let schools handle it the way they do and do our best to isolate sick kids
6856332 its an enormous problem because our schools are serving crap
6856333 how about we put calorie labels on cafeteria food like we do at baskin robbins

6856343 i think teachers definately make enough they start out on 17 595 but everyone gets far more than that a year then after a year in teaching you receive a 5000 bonus above your yearly wage

6856345 a very large number of the clearance teams will be stopping by the end of this month if we dont get funds before that
6856346 its not done until its done and the discussions are really ongoing and ongoing and ongoing but hopefully drawing to a conclusion
6856347 cut and run john murtha is in charge of the appropriations committee for defense and he is certainly no friend of the military
6856348 and dont talk to me about him being an ex marine lord that was 40 years ago a lot of stuff can happen in 40 years thank you for your service as being an ex marine but that doesnt mean youre not an idiot and he is

6856353 and this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations and then the end will come

6856355 people dont understand when were out here a lot of guys are going through different types of things

6856357 that is one of the biggest things you try to teach guys in life youre going to be going through things
6856358 youre going to have a job one day if you let that kind of stuff affect you here its going to affect you in the long run
6856359 so we just try to let guys know whatever youre going through football is still important and whatever else youre going through well help you
6856360 the first year revealed that vienna has the potential to position itself with a design festival
6856361 the austrian design scene needs a stage like this to visualise and exchange ideas on an international level we aim at developing an independent programme for the future that strengthens vienna sustainably as a design city
6856362 design is all around us it often enriches and eases everyday life but is only made clearly visible by events such as the vdw design is a crucial part of the creative industries as an important and dynamic economic factor for our city the input of design can be an essential advantage in competition we have to make people more aware of this this is why i am happy that departure and the city of vienna are once again partners of the vdw and i am looking forward to the multifaceted programme
6856363 professional creative accomplishments are an important impulse transmitter for the viennese economy one reason for the vienna economic chamber to support vienna design week again this year the design festival has the potential to show viennese creativity and make it well known for this reason it provides an economic surplus as partner of important creative initiatives such as the vienna design week the vienna economic chamber underlines the importance of entrepreneurial power in the creative sector thus vienna can be positioned as first class creative and economic location
6856364 passionswege 2008 paths of passion are one key element of vienna design week

6856493 amazingly enough weve received nothing but support from staff and people who know us
6856494 we are very confident that hes the individual that savagely sexually assaulted this woman over the weekend
6856495 this would not have been solved if it werent for the poise of the victim the perseverance of the community providing us with tips and the investigative work of the investigative team
6856496 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
6856497 i made a wish that if they ever made it into a movie i wanted to be in it
6856498 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6856499 it is my understanding that they russian forces have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that

6856501 oh but wait that isnt so much about emergency preparedness as about saving money

6856510 this is the sort of thing that is going to just further undermine our confidence among voters in the voting technology thats being used very widely right now
6856511 theres already been widespread criticism of the touchscreen technology and the lack of paper trail which means you dont have a meaningful recount capability
6856512 i would expect that over the next couple years as we move toward 2010 and 12 well likely see more movement and maybe a further push from congress toward setting up some kind of uniform national system were probably the only major democracy in the world that has this kind of highly decentralized system now
6856513 it makes designing the ballot and coming up with an efficient method of recording and counting votes much more complicated
6856514 testing software is actually a lot of work and its hard
6856515 you want to get that out there where everybody can feed on it and make it really robust

6856520 i share the interest and anxiety of many hoosiers who would love to see evan bayh on the ticket
6856521 i think it could make it a blue state in november
6856522 in indiana hes a favorite son hes an administrator he has been the ceo of the state of indiana he governed without tax increases jobs grew and he showed hoosiers he could govern and i think hes very very much a midwesterner
6856523 my ultimate goal is that nothing leaves this place and nothing comes in
6856524 if people could be free of their expenses people could afford to be living without a lot of money going out im by no means self sufficient im still on the grid
6856525 i love to garden it just makes sense this lot yields a lot of produce at least enough for a family or two
6856526 im having more fun gardening than i have had my whole life
6856527 ive planted by the road for the express reason to show that you can grow produce here
6856528 the fuel thing is going to make people think if you cant rely on what you have at your disposal it will put you in a bind
6856529 i wish everyone would do this partly because of how fun it is and there isnt anxiety of where your food will come from
6856530 when i drive down the road people honk it must be funny seeing some old fart driving down the road on a scooter not just because its electric but because its small
6856531 some people might think that not heating your house is stupid but if youre worried about electricity its really about economics
6856532 whether or not theres global warming theres the fact that it costs money its not free the biggest concern is that poor people wont be able to afford to live if they dont have options poor people have every right to the goods of the earth as everyone else does
6856533 i grew up on a farm you just do it
6856534 some peoples idea of beauty is a piece of asphalt thats swept not a garden
6856535 but i consider myself a steward of the ground its in my bones i was on a sailboat and sailed from hawaii to oregon i missed the land and the seasons
6856536 i love the dirt sun and water because of what they do they sustain the whole planet

6856539 i wished i had known how to train her differently in a kinder way
6856540 this builds a cooperation based relationship between dogs and humans instead of the domination based methods
6856541 when things go wrong with your dogs it can cause a great deal of stress in the household
6856542 people dont always have these resources or tools we arent taught its an ongoing process of living with another being modern lifestyle is unsuited to living with dogs they are expected to be little people in fur suits humans dont always know how to reckon with behavioral problems like jumping chewing barking pulling on a leash reacting to other dogs fear based or anxiety based behaviors
6856543 these dogs are trained to be highly responsive and protective of their handler
6856544 i work with them as a team to drop their stress levels which is a natural hazard of observant living
6856545 i use positive reward based training methods correct good behaviors teach a dog to sit and then give a reward
6856546 when there are problems i like being able to work for the family by observing observing observing there are many ways people come up with their own solutions to problems it doesnt have to be perfect just good enough
6856547 working with people who have lost their beloved is such a privilege
6856548 i feel that crossing the species barrier in relationships is a precious thing

6856566 afterward he wanted to leave but he was circled by soldiers it was impossible he was in the orchards hiding from the russians in case they lit the house he was walking and met the russian soldiers and he made up his mind that he couldnt stay any more the russian soldiers called him and asked where he was going if he was going to the american side
6856567 my husband said he was going to see his family
6856568 and the russians said again are you going to the american side
6856569 so the russians view you as the american side even though there are no americans here

6856595 the us government wants to see this verification package as soon as possible so that we can move forward with this delisting
6856596 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
6856597 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6856598 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6856599 the balance were trying to reach is between iraqs stated desire to have a more concrete view of us forces levels out through the years and our desire it be based on conditions on the ground
6856600 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6856601 the suspicious agreement means eternal bondage it violates the iraqi constitution
6856602 no no to america no no to israel we will not allow iraq to be an american colony
6856603 we try to look for the best ones but theres no magic to any given market and things are cheaper than they were a year ago in markets here and in markets around the world

6856606 but we have been importing like 17 percent of gdp gross domestic product if we have that gap and it continues the dollar over time will get weaker not necessarily next week or next month or next year but it will get weaker over time
6856607 i think it is going to be longer and deeper but no one knows when what you do know is that it will turn around
6856608 i mean the country will be doing far better five years from now than it is now but it wont be in my judgment it probably wont be doing better five months from now

6856724 as ive said before in terms of salaries players have to want to come out of the premier league to play in the championship its not just a case of picking a phone up and taking someone as finance will always play a big part

6856737 microsoft is already an established brand their software is unbeatable and to have seinfeld on the screen making a joke or two will just seal the deal and beat the apple ads
6856738 microsoft has strategic and operational problems with vista its perceived as too complicated and difficult to use the company also has perceptional problems
6856739 using seinfeld could be a brilliant move if he addresses some of the real issues in a funny way
6856740 when seinfelds show was a hit most of the mac buyers were watching cartoons
6856741 his persona is more of an apple guy anyway and in the show he even had an old square mac on the back desk
6856742 despite some of the best marketing support in the industry you cant undo that image with frankly he appeals to me but im 53 years old and i am not switching to macs
6856743 however the next generation of computer buyers want macs and their ad campaign has reenforced it with the 18 to 24 and the 24 to 30 demographic groups

6856745 the world now has a precariously balanced oil market that cannot withstand any meaningful oil supply disruptions without significantly higher oil price implications
6856746 additionally increasing demand from caspian countries for a bigger piece of the oil profits may continue to delay and push back some of the larger projects scheduled to come online over the next five years
6856747 we believe that over the next three to five years the world will see no meaningful or sustainable net increase in non opec oil production

6856776 legitimate businesses that hedge and take physical delivery of oil are being trampled by the speculators who are in the market purely to make profit
6856777 its difficult to comprehend how the cftc would allow a trader to get 11 of the market and not scrutinize this position any sooner
6856778 this could eventually drive commodity prices up and have catastrophic economic effects on millions of already stressed u s consumers
6856779 it is now evident that speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought and it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices
6856780 we are pleased to see that high point university is ranked among the top colleges and universities in the nation

6856802 but is tim curry hotter than the other two old guys
6856803 no i think the bald one is the best he s got a sloe eyed kinda look
6856804 but he said this project really looked like it was doable

6856807 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6856808 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6856809 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6856810 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6856811 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6856812 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6856813 our feeling is that this is truly a new competition and the kind of aircraft the air force feels they need have changed
6856814 all we are asking for is a significant amount of time to put together a competitive proposal
6856815 we really do want to provide them with their next generation tanker but if we do not have enough time to prepare a competitive bid then we have to decide if its worth it
6856816 the idea is to empower women on this crucial subject and prevent hiv and aids the transmission of sexual diseases and family planning affirmed lucy del carpio
6856817 in some sectors and regions of the country women are too modest and dont like to touch their vagina
6856818 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6856819 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6856820 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6856821 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6856822 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6856823 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6856824 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6856825 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6856826 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6856827 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6856828 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6856829 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6856830 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6856831 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6856832 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6856833 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6856834 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6856835 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6856836 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

6856843 si no existiera la deuda que pide saldar el gobernador juan schiaretti no estar a la partida del presupuesto por la que hay 570 millones de pesos asignados para la provincia
6856844 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6856845 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6856846 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6856847 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6856848 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6856849 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6856850 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6856851 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6856852 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6856853 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6856854 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6856855 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6856856 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6856857 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6856858 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6856859 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6856860 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6856861 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6856862 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6856863 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6856864 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6856865 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6856866 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6856867 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6856868 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6856869 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6856870 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6856871 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6856872 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6856873 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6856874 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6856875 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6856876 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6856877 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6856878 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6856879 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
6856880 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6856881 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6856882 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6856883 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6856884 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
6856885 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
6856886 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
6856887 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
6856888 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
6856889 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6856890 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6856891 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6856892 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6856893 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6856894 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6856895 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6856896 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6856897 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6856898 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6856899 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal

6856901 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community

6856904 a security vulnerability was discovered yesterday in the linux kernel packages of the ubuntu 8
6856905 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6856906 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6856907 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6856908 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6856909 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6856910 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6856911 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6856912 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6856913 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

6856938 browsing the package repository of my linux distribution led me to applications for everything from gene sequencing to particle physics blatantly supporting linux sort of

6856945 we were surprised that the company was somewhat cavalier about its loss of market share and about its below industry growth comp rate while it is true that one quarters results do not firmly establish a trend we would have expected the company to better explain its failure to comp near the industry average instead management and several of our competitors appear to believe that nothing is wrong

6856959 triggered star formation continues to be very hard to prove
6856960 but our preliminary analysis shows that the phenomenon can explain the multiple generations of stars seen in the w5 region
6856961 our first look at this region suggests we are looking at one or two generations of stars that were triggered by the massive stars
6856962 we plan to follow up with even more detailed measurements of the stars ages to see if there is a distinct time gap between the stars just inside and outside the rim
6856963 he likes to get along with people he likes to listen to them
6856964 a lucky politician is one who knows how to take advantage of a break when he gets it
6856965 look at his life and there are half a dozen times when he could have failed being abandoned by his father his troubled adolescent years but he seems to weather adversity better than most
6856966 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
6856967 he has this unusual combination of life experiences that dont fit in any stereotype
6856968 he wasnt part of student government he wasnt in any ap advanced placement classes he was a young man concerned with hanging out with his buddies playing basketball body surfing and eating in excess
6856969 my mother was pretty instrumental in helping barack cultivate this internal flexibility
6856970 after the childhood we had different could never be jarring or dislocating
6856971 growing up i wasnt always sure who i was or what i was doing
6856972 push questions of who i was out of my mind
6856973 hes a gregarious guy and he loves people but he also loves his own company he doesnt expect those closest to him to be all things to him
6856974 its not all fire inside of him there are wide cool pools of water as well
6856975 he wasnt trying to get peoples goats or get a rise out of them
6856976 would have two very pithy paragraphs and it would all be in there he was a very good writer he was succinct
6856977 i didnt socialize that much i was like a monk
6856978 he would tell us youve got to do things right youve got to take the high road
6856979 he would talk about no permanent friends no permanent enemies
6856980 he became very effective at getting people who did initially did not get along to work together and build alliances
6856981 he found a way to be tough and challenging when he didnt like something at the same time he was not one to burn his bridges with people
6856982 black people would say harold will take care of the problem
6856983 the victories were small they changed peoples lives but they didnt change american society and he wanted to do that
6856984 means you can take risks you can try to do things to improve society and still land on your feet
6856985 he was very straightforward and had a no nonsense all the cards on the table approach
6856986 by choosing to move to hyde park he moved in an area where an independent can come out of nowhere to win
6856987 by choosing to work at that law firm he was making a to where he stood
6856988 he worked all the right circles if you dont like the guy hes a calculating politician if you do hes a smart methodical worker he does nothing thats different from most politicians even the reform politicians the difference is hes extraordinarily gifted his greatest capability is he never makes the same mistake twice
6856989 but he never tips his hand to what he thinks you feel youre on stage and have to perform at the end of the day you dont know whether youve changed his mind or not
6856990 some members of both parties thought that barack was longwinded and a tad aloof and arrogant not me
6856991 how much money do you have in your campaign fund
6856992 hes a realist and he knows when to fold his cards
6856993 i know what its like to have people tell me i cant do something because of my color and i know the bitter swill of swallowed back anger
6856994 my gosh you cant lose two races in a row
6856995 he said if its ok with me it should be ok with you
6856996 if you have the ability to communicate and the timing is right the moment is right things come together all those ingredients were there for barack
6856997 hes the one who walked through it and did the heavy lifting
6856998 he tapped into the new technology better than any candidate ever has he knew what to do with the internet and e mail in a way no candidate has

6857003 since eucalypts and banksias not to mention all of the bush creatures are found right across australia gibbs had created images that appealed to the entire nation seed pod hats gum blossom skirts gumleaf and sea shell houses leaf boats and stick chairs set imaginations running wild children everywhere couldnt help but wonder when they saw such things whether gumnut babies really did live there especially when they could actually see their scribbly writing on the trees gibbs took what every child could easily find and gave it a fantasy life of its own

6857006 i spotted joe quickly but he was trying to hide from the crowds by tucking in between a few people he was wearing a baseball cap and real casual dress so he wouldnt stand out
6857007 he watched only her performance then walked backstage to the meet and greet area but when he saw people start to recognize him he hid it was real obvious he didnt want people to know he was there to see taylor
6857008 hes an amazing guy and anybody would be lucky to be dating him

6857028 kilpatrick is a superdelegate to the democratic national convention next week in denver
6857029 the idea of the sport sessions be they football or netball is to reduce the level of anti social behaviour and low level crime by giving young people something to do
6857030 although there has been a specific week of action this is just sparking ongoing community involvement in the sporting activities
6857031 this programme has had a very positive impact on low level crime add to your site
6857032 the counties of north and south humberside have not been in existence for over 10 years having reverted to the original names of east yorkshire and north and north east lincolnshire
6857033 however companies and government departments persist in using these outdated titles in addresses
6857034 the majority of people did not wish to become part of humberside and to continue using this title long after its abolition is offensive
6857035 any name change for humberside police would prove extremely costly and i suspect that the taxpayers in all four unitary authorities that we serve would agree there are far better ways for their money to be spent
6857036 furthermore although humberside no longer exists as a county the people served by humberside police do indeed live on both sides of the river humber
6857037 royal mail does not use county information because it has not been required for postal purposes for many years
6857038 we want to remind our customers about the importance of correct addressing at every opportunity
6857039 however royal mail is one of a number of companies who sells address databases to external organisations
6857040 our postal address file includes three types of county information the former postal county the traditional county and the administrative county

6857061 we still believe that an agreement can be reached by the end of the year
6857062 but theres no attempt on the part of the u s government to push the parties beyond where they believe they can go the important thing here is that both sides have committed to trying to reach an agreement its in the best interest of both peoples its in the best interests of the united states and the rest of the international community
6857063 since my appointment as ceo the management team has been dedicated to harnessing pxls expertise in biomarker discovery and development to produce a pipeline of diagnostic products based on the companys proprietary platform simply put the eukarion portfolio no longer fits with our corporate development strategy
6857064 pxl must remain focused on allocating resources to leverage the progress made with our two near term revenue generating programs tb amp wheatrite tm to consolidate the companys role as a leader in developing point of need diagnostic tests for infectious and respiratory diseases
6857065 we believe this compelling combination would create a strong platform for sustainable long term growth to better address the changing healthcare industry and provide meaningful cost effective medicines that improve the quality of life for patients
6857066 the transaction would create a diversified specialty pharmaceutical company with greater commercialization capabilities an expanded portfolio of pain management products and a strengthened pipeline which would include multiple platform technologies
6857067 our 33 00 per share all cash proposal provides alpharma stockholders with a substantial cash premium for their investment in the company we are confident that this combination would deliver significant benefits and superior value to our respective stockholders and employees and create a stronger platform to deliver innovation to patients prescribers and customers importantly it would also further diversify kings business with an additional source of steady cash flow from alpharmas animal health division a leading feed additives business in addition a combination with alpharma would deliver significant synergies
6857068 we believe our all cash proposal is too compelling to ignore in light of the fact that the alpharma board declined this proposal we think it is important for the stockholders of both companies to be aware of this exciting opportunity it remains our strong preference to work cooperatively with alpharma regarding this proposal
6857069 jerry could sell anything people will watch these jerry is rich successful everything that regular people want to be if this ad runs internationally it will have an even bigger impact
6857070 microsoft is already an established brand their software is unbeatable and to have seinfeld on the screen making a joke or two will just seal the deal and beat the apple ads
6857071 microsoft has strategic and operational problems with vista its perceived as too complicated and difficult to use the company also has perceptional problems
6857072 using seinfeld could be a brilliant move if he addresses some of the real issues in a funny way
6857073 when seinfelds show was a hit most of the mac buyers were watching cartoons
6857074 his persona is more of an apple guy anyway and in the show he even had an old square mac on the back desk
6857075 despite some of the best marketing support in the industry you cant undo that image with frankly he appeals to me but im 53 years old and i am not switching to macs
6857076 however the next generation of computer buyers want macs and their ad campaign has reenforced it with the 18 to 24 and the 24 to 30 demographic groups

6857083 historically marketing budgets are among the first to be cut in a budget crunch but marketers should be cautious about trying to find a quick fix
6857084 in fact spending more during tough times when competitors may be scaling back is a good way to strategically boost market share because this often helps brands come out ahead when the economy rebounds before rushing to slash marketing spending it is important to carefully evaluate how effective short term budget management can lead to significant long term benefits
6857085 effective marketing spending during economic downturns is not about how much you spend but how you spend it
6857086 marketers must assess how consumers and customer behavior can be positively influenced during tough times if it can then marketers should give increased consideration to more spending rather than cutting

6857088 youre much more interesting to read now that you left the star liberating isnt it
6857089 next months commission income isnt promised so i have to save money today
6857090 many businesses have cyclical periods so owners need a reserve to supplement their personal finances when not enough revenue comes in
6857091 begin saving an amount that youre comfortable with where you wont go back and withdraw the funds next month
6857092 even if youre only depositing 10 to 15 a month youll at least have some savings
6857093 regularly set aside just 10 now and it can build to hundreds of dollars down the line
6857094 dont wait until the end of the month to pay yourself
6857095 the easiest way to save consistently is to set up an automatic draft from your checking account into a savings account where you dont have to be responsible for moving the money manually
6857096 i typically take half of my commission and split it between my business and personal bank accounts
6857097 from the personal account i designate an amount every month that automatically goes into my sep simplified employee pension and another amount that automatically deposits into my savings to build up a cushion
6857098 you cant say that to me i was a pow

6857117 la corte europea potrebbe avere delle riserve nel senso che alcuni principi della costituzione come quello di uguaglianza non sono modificabili e quindi possibile che si apra una discussione molto seria a livello di corte di giustizia europea proprio sulla compatibilit di questo modello con i principi della convenzione europea
6857118 non dobbiamo dimenticare che il sistema giudiziario attuale che garantisce lautonomia della magistratura stato scritto sulla base delle vicende storiche del 48 i giudici in passato obbedivano al governo fascista la scelta di una magistratura indipendente che si governa da sola e stata fatta sulla base di quella esperienza

6857126 the formula used to determine which colleges and universities offer the best value relates a schools academic quality as indicated by its 2009 u s news ranking to the 2007 2008 academic year net cost of attendance for a student who receives the average level of need based financial aid
6857127 the higher the quality of the program and the lower the cost the better the deal only schools ranked in or near the top half of their categories are included because we work on the premise that the most significant values are among colleges that are above average academically
6857128 there are many factors behind taylor universitys recognition as a great educational value
6857129 we have been blessed with dedicated alumni friends parents faculty staff and even students who have given of themselves so that others may experience a taylor education
6857130 taylor university has enjoyed his blessings for over 162 years and we are forever grateful
6857131 we appreciate the recognition from u s news as it speaks to the return on investment made by students their families and the taylor faculty
6857132 there are basic benchmarks by which we can hold ourselves accountable but there are also intangible aspects of a taylor education that reinforce its true value we are collaboratively investing in more than four years and degree programs but in people who are creating change

6857136 this was a difficult decision but it was the right one there is nothing more important than the safety of our national team
6857137 we appreciate all the efforts of the icc task team the pakistan cricket board the pakistan authorities and the security consultants the players are naturally disappointed for their fans and the people of pakistan that they will not have a chance to see them in action in that country in september
6857138 we are filled with gratitude to god for this honor for taylor university
6857139 the only appropriate response to this exciting news is praise and thanksgiving to god for the great things he has been doing at taylor
6857140 we are deeply appreciative of this external validation from a well respected publication that has been refining the collegiate survey and ranking process for well over 20 years
6857141 this accomplishment is shared by every member of our community from our students alumni faculty and staff to our parents board of trustees and friends and it again reflects that this christ centered university attracts gifted people who together strive to accomplish great things for the kingdom of god

6857166 blog comments should absolutely be monitored using technological tools and also human intervention trash i e slander hatred etc should not be published
6857167 for my blogs i generally do not allow comments to run until i have moderated them obviously i do not edit comments they either run or they dont
6857168 they often start discussions that are at a higher sophistication level than some other posters they kind of set the tone from the get go

6857170 you have to believe what i believe and im going to keep arguing until you do
6857171 now blogs are another story as a journalist i cringe when i hear about people accepting things like blogs and unofficial stories as news
6857172 one big difference is you know youre getting some form of professionalism with print as opposed to sites that arent part of the mainstream media
6857173 not everyone is adept with all the new storytelling tools so sending reporters out into the field with videocameras sic for example may or may not be helpful if the reporter is not a visual person
6857174 reporters have to want to use new tools and have to understand how these many new tools can add to a story its challenging to use multimedia tools in an additive fashion rather than in a subtractive fashion it takes practice to shoot good video to record compelling sound
6857175 multimedia journalism the age of new technology and new opportunities

6857197 kunci lainnya adalah nama tazyaar kurasa ini adalah sebuah anagram karena jika kau mengubah susunannya maka tazyaar dapat menjadi zaratya yang merupakan nama panjangmu jadi kurasa tazyaar adalah kau

6857202 is not scheduled to be in the recording studio with britney
6857203 she kept eyeing justin but stopped short of actually walking over to say hello justin kept his back to her she was obviously waiting for him to turn around but he never did
6857204 when the concert was over jessica and justin left together and britney exited in the opposite direction
6857205 when the democrats took control of congress in 2007 and oil was 50 a barrel and corn 2 a bushel house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid promised an energy plan were still waiting for it today crude oil is 134 and corn is 6 50 its pretty clear whos to blame congress in fact house and senate democrats have obstructed any progress in america s fight to regain some semblance of energy independence

6857211 he was standing on zuma beach in the early morning after working all night as a production assistant on a music video and was quoted as saying he realized he was wasting his time
6857212 he drove up the coast slept in his car and started making the moves that would launch his career
6857213 this name obviously links to big brother kingstons and is another nod to jamaica and reggae

6857230 total sales by the big three carriers will amount to 3 5 million iphones within the next two years
6857231 this number 3 5 million could turn out to be inflated the operators could lose money because they took all risks upon themselves having failed to dictate terms to retail chains through which they will sell the iphones
6857232 i know nothing about it only that klaas feels very good at ajax
6857233 we have already said earlier that we dont want to see a repeat of what happened last season when a player left ajax at a very late stage
6857234 having demonstrated its ability to play a strong defense management now must in our view demonstrate that it can play offense
6857235 it must fill attractive stores with compelling and inspiring merchandise and then use every tool to drive the customer back to into the stores
6857236 the trajectory of our traffic in our business is unacceptable
6857237 all the brands have been told until product and until store conditions and until the appropriate marketing message have been identified theres going to be no release of funds to drive marketing
6857238 however we are concerned that expense savings will be harder to come by sales pressure will remain

6857276 legitimate businesses that hedge and take physical delivery of oil are being trampled by the speculators who are in the market purely to make profit
6857277 its difficult to comprehend how the cftc would allow a trader to get 11 of the market and not scrutinize this position any sooner
6857278 this could eventually drive commodity prices up and have catastrophic economic effects on millions of already stressed u s consumers
6857279 it is now evident that speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought and it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices
6857280 as far as britney getting back in the studio its obviously a good thing if shes doing what she loves because shes had a love for music for such a long time then im all for it
6857281 im glad shes pulling it together because everybody falls down in life at one time or another the toughest part is how do you pick yourself up again it looks like shes on the path to doing that and its a good thing to see
6857282 we get a laugh out of it shes really cool she just takes everything as it comes
6857283 she doesnt read about herself but i think people tell her and she gets a kick out of it shes very calm and very secure she knows people are always going to talk that stuff doesnt bother her
6857284 you cant say its the economy because there are shows like mamma mia that are selling out
6857285 its not that katies bad in the part shes good enough the producers are just getting the feeling people still want to view katie as her character sweet little joey potter
6857286 that information is totally false there is a healthy advance for the show and there is no chance of the run being shortened
6857287 don is the hardest working guy on this tour hes the guy who puts our spines back in place whenever somebodys arm flies off or somebodys shoulder falls off hes there

6857290 the long term goal of the studio is to take advantage of what has become a very global market by focusing on bigger films that require a bigger commitment
6857291 by 2011 mr robinov plans for dc comics to supply the material for up to two of the six to eight tent pole films he hopes warner bros will have in the pipeline by then
6857292 batman vs superman after the 215 million superman returns which had disappointing box office returns didnt please executives superman didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to says mr robinov it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009 he adds but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all
6857293 with batman vs superman and justice league stalled warner bros has quietly adopted marvels model of releasing a single film for each character and then using those movies and their sequels to build up to a multicharacter film along those lines we have been developing every dc character that we own mr robinov says
6857294 watchmen is the subject of a high profile copyright lawsuit filed in u s district court for the central district of california by news corp s twentieth century fox last week a federal judge ruled that it may have rights to the property
6857295 were going to try to go dark to the extent that the characters allow it
6857296 i feel very strongly that this is a contribution to our society at large i never do things halfway i have committed to this company and the ideas and i am going to be there for quite some time
6857297 i think everybody is looking for the organism that will be perfect and there is no perfect organism we have to realize that we are dealing with living organisms we dont want an exotic introduced in an area where youre going to have a huge problem as a result of that organism being there
6857298 eventually wed really like to take the expertise that is here and interact with people who have photoreactors and systems where they are looking for high efficiency organisms so we can sort of help them optimize the beast in the pond so to speak
6857299 we cant confirm any casting until an official announcement closer to the airdate
6857300 i can definitively say the events that led to the 2003 blackout are much less likely to occur
6857301 the grid doesnt have a brain that makes sense of it in a holistic way
6857302 the vision is of a very highly efficient kind of superhighway
6857303 im not aware of any utility thats building a transmission line that doesnt on occasion need to make use of such a tool
6857304 we have no reason to believe that air new zealand was in any way remiss they did everything they could
6857305 we dont know at this point how many weeks she was or what took place on the aircraft at the moment our priority is to make sure the passengers involved and our staff are okay
6857306 some women do get on flights and dont tell airlines

6857313 i was reluctant to disfigure the sign any further still i think i shall be haunted by that perversity emense in my train whistle blighted dreams tonight
6857314 statement on the signage of our national parks and public lands to come
6857315 if you believe that america is too smug too self satisfied too rich then lets destroy america
6857316 first to destroy america turn america into a bilingual or multi lingual and bicultural country
6857317 the histories of bilingual and bicultural societies that do not assimilate are histories of turmoil tension and tragedy
6857318 invent multiculturalism and encourage immigrants to maintain their culture i would make it an article of belief that all cultures are equal that there are no cultural differences i would make it an article of faith that the black and hispanic dropout rates are due solely to prejudice and discrimination by the majority every other explanation is out of bounds
6857319 we could make the united states an hispanic quebec without much effort
6857320 the apparent success of our own multiethnic and multicultural experiment might have been achieved not by tolerance but by hegemony without the dominance that once dictated ethnocentricity and what it meant to be an american we are left with only tolerance and pluralism to hold us together
6857321 i would encourage all immigrants to keep their own language and culture i would replace the melting pot metaphor with the salad bowl metaphor it is important to ensure that we have various cultural subgroups living in america enforcing their differences rather than as americans emphasizing their similarities
6857322 fourth i would make our fastest growing demographic group the least educated i would add a second underclass unassimilated undereducated and antagonistic to our population i would have this second underclass have a 50 dropout rate from high school
6857323 my fifth point for destroying america would be to get big foundations and business to give these efforts lots of money i would invest in ethnic identity and i would establish the cult of victimology i would get all minorities to think that their lack of success was the fault of the majority i would start a grievance industry blaming all minority failure on the majority population
6857324 my sixth plan for americas downfall would include dual citizenship and promote divided loyalties
6857325 next to last i would place all subjects off limits make it taboo to talk about anything against the cult of diversity i would find a word similar to heretic in the 16th century that stopped discussion and paralyzed thinking words like racist or xenophobe halt discussion and debate having made america a bilingual bicultural country having established multi culturism having the large foundations fund the doctrine of victimology i would next make it impossible to enforce our immigration laws i would develop a mantra that because immigration has been good for america it must always be good i would make every individual immigrant symmetric and ignore the cumulative impact of millions of them
6857326 lastly i would censor victor davis hansons book mexifornia his book is dangerous it exposes the plan to destroy america if you feel america deserves to be destroyed dont read that book
6857327 public enemy thinking of doing it for free in denver ballet company facing a season dancing to canned tunes myspace counting on music to reign supreme and the latest itunes music subscription service rumor

6857343 the first two games i thought we bowled ok we just couldnt string any doubles even though we were hitting the pocket
6857344 we both caught breaks early in that third game and just kept stringing them after that the law of averages came our way
6857345 that second frame in game 3 just seemed to spark everything for us
6857346 it loosened up my swing a little bit and patrick kept throwing the ball really well and we started striking
6857347 we had pretty high expectations and were pretty happy with our pairings
6857348 we were excited to be bowling together on that pattern and to have the day we had today is pretty disappointing
6857349 after third game my ball reaction wasnt quite as good and the pins got really really really stubborn
6857350 everything that could go wrong did i didnt execute as well as i needed to wasnt playing the lanes quite properly and the pins didnt want to fall basically a combination of everything

6857354 we believe nov 14 is a great date that allows us to play straight through thanksgiving and right into christmas
6857355 the world now has a precariously balanced oil market that cannot withstand any meaningful oil supply disruptions without significantly higher oil price implications
6857356 additionally increasing demand from caspian countries for a bigger piece of the oil profits may continue to delay and push back some of the larger projects scheduled to come online over the next five years
6857357 we believe that over the next three to five years the world will see no meaningful or sustainable net increase in non opec oil production
6857358 here is a significant reason why i would buy pbr instead of strohs most other cheap beers have fn ugly graphic design i dont want to see those cans in the party or in my recycling bin
6857359 well i had my first pair of decks when i was 15 or i was into hip hop and got my first pair of technics on my 18th birthday i was a breakdancer and i did graffiti when i was going shopping in birmingham buying my hip hop stuff these new records were how i got into house music
6857360 thats a bit of hard one its just an interest in music i have always been into music when we were at school and hip hop came out i was always the person who had the stereo playing tapes it was just a fascination with music in my opinion its the djs who create the music at the end of the day they are defining whats happening when the scene took off i was already a dj i was already into house music or techno or whatever it was when it first came out it was never really an ambition like oh i wanna be a dj it just kind of happened simply because i was into music
6857361 i wouldnt have run that piece there was nothing in it
6857362 it was filled with innuendo when youre done reading it youre like theres no there there

6857371 logan had a little bit of a setback injury wise
6857372 i think hes back on course he was impressive in training camp this kid is a smart hockey player
6857373 the way things go in this league i never say never we have a pretty experienced team so it would probably lean towards sending him back to juniors but you still want people coming to camp believing they can make the team
6857374 hes been a kid that every time weve had people in to see him hes been involved in a lot of plays
6857375 hes not a player who worries about statistics he does what the team needs you get excited about people who have adaptable skills hell be able to make a team and then be able to stay on a team his numbers were good in college they probably could have been better but hes not that kind of a player with guys like steve you never have to worry about him going in a scoring drought for a week even if theyre not scoring theyre still going to be important players
6857376 justin is 6 2 and drew is 6 1 these kids have really shot up in the last year
6857377 these were the best players in that area and they really grew a lot theyre pretty good players the course that theyre taking the guys who have taken this course because they needed to add some weight and have success at each level its worked out better
6857378 a hard nosed winger who stays around the front of the net he gives you some physical grit but he can play with skilled players he can stay in front of the net on the power play and he wont move hes also not a bad penalty killer its hard to find left wings in this business
6857379 i think whats happened is that the coaches in the minors have spent a lot of time with him on his defensive game and maybe its taken away a little bit of his creativity
6857380 hes a big kid and hes making good progress hes going to spend at least another year at boston college well go year by year and see how it goes
6857381 hell be in worcester starting out but we think hes close to being able to play some games here the kid is a pretty good player hes a good offensive player but hes got a little bit of bite to him too
6857382 hes got to play more if he was with a lot of other teams maybe he gets 30 games its a little different here
6857383 hes really close i think the group we have coming underneath its a real good group we had a lot of people calling about our young goalies
6857384 hes on the world junior tryout roster so hopefully that will be another step forward for him
6857385 he had a great career in the western league and he played some great games for us last season too
6857386 were expecting him to have a real big year were trying to keep everyone playing
6857387 l matamba est bien es una de las opciones para el partido del domingo

6857390 the government is not giving attention to this at all
6857391 its not paying attention to the real challenges the country is facing and terrorism is the most important challenge facing this nation
6857392 i looked back and saw the limbs of my colleagues flying through the air
6857393 theyre trying to dictate their terms to the government enforce their will on the government by saying you stop these operations
6857394 if the judges are not restored we will prefer to sit on opposition benches
6857395 its an honor to receive this doctorate jackson said in a prepared statement
6857396 we have put this on hold for a few years and this year works out just right und had hoped it would be at a commencement but a convocation for orientation seems like the right thing
6857397 usd is pleased to award the honorary doctorate of letters degree to an outstanding alumnus of the university mr
6857398 mr jackson was nominated for this distinction by the academic faculty and staff of the university the award acknowledges mr jacksons commitment to scholarship and to the application of philosophical and psychological principles to human performance and excellence in athletic competition
6857399 the university means a lot to phil and this is a prestigious honor buss said
6857400 phil has said that it was very special for him to have the opportunity to receive a scholarship to play basketball in college an opportunity that changed his life
6857401 i was asked to do strictly this year i did think about it i really have a passion for the show it would look so rotten so wrong for me to do it this year maybe next year
6857402 the dancing show looks like such a great show it seems such a great show to work on
6857403 for programme makers reality tv is cheap unless of course you ask me to do it its very cheap
6857404 a lot of the shows which are filmed in peoples homes arent reality
6857405 a few cars witnessed the accident and had stopped to try and help
6857406 is that i know so many more lives are invested in this than just my own
6857407 this is wonderful for our team and for our organization its a fantastic achievement and ill embrace it and enjoy it but as soon as were done i have to get back to where im needed which is with my family
6857408 if it helps them in any sort of way at all then that makes us feel good
6857409 i dont wear my heart on my sleeve i wanted to shake the coachs hand because it was a hell of a match that was it and then i wanted to go meet the guys and celebrate with them im not going to run around like a headless chicken thats just not me
6857410 when i needed a little bit of energy i just thought about my family thought about everybody elses family thats here
6857411 ive learned a tremendous amount about being a human being from him over the last four years
6857412 im not sure we could do it without him back
6857413 because lord knows theyve been having a hard time doing it
6857414 at this moment i can tell you that not a single russian soldier or piece of military hardware remains in the town of gori
6857415 some two hours ago they started their withdrawal from checkpoints that were set up on nearby mountains then around half an hour ago the last checkpoint was removed in gori too
6857416 in short were going home peace to all countries what else can i say theres no need for war there should be friendship
6857417 were just doing our bit were following orders were leaving here now
6857418 the officer explained the situation this way at the roki tunnel 150 officers of the fsb russias federal security service are searching the columns of vehicles very thoroughly and it takes a lot of time
6857419 theyre doing this in order to make sure that the soldiers dont take any looted goods or weapons or maybe even money that dont belong to them so everyone is being checked and as the officer said that is why this process of withdrawal has dragged on for so long
6857420 in order to stop groups of looters and prevent the delivery of unaccounted for weapons and ammunition
6857421 18 peacekeeping surveillance posts have been set up along the administrative border between georgia and south ossetia
6857422 units of the georgian armed forces are concentrating in central georgia restoring their combat capability and preparing for further actions
6857423 georgian forces are carrying out reconnaissance into the character and direction of the actions of russian troops and south ossetian formations and are preparing military actions in the georgia south ossetia conflict zone
6857424 yesterday august 21 general borisov had a fairly heated discussion with gori regional governor vladimer vardzelashvili about the so called buffer zone borisov had all kinds of maps out and was referring to the 1992 cease fire agreement which stipulates that the conflict zone included quite a lot of villages north of gori in gori district including two villages that are located along the main east west highway shavshvebi and agara
6857425 so if we go with that agreement it would mean that the so called peacekeepers who would replace the regular russian troops will have the right to control the main highway and even establish checkpoints
6857426 as far as i know senaki would not be in any buffer zone
6857427 senaki is about 40 kilometers away from the border with abkhazia there is i believe a 14 kilometer zone on either side of the administrative border between abkhazia and the rest of georgia the russians definitely have the right to patrol that area under the old agreements senaki is way away from there what the russians are saying is that it falls into the zone of responsibility of the peacekeepers i havent heard them refer to a specific document that gives them the right to stay in senaki or poti
6857428 there is going to be a huge need for western aid when the russians finally do ship out and it looks like it is going to come
6857429 if the aid comes fast if it is significant then i think president mikheil saakashvili may be able to turn around and say look this was always coming anyway
6857430 if he can say all those things then hes in a stronger position but a lot will depend on the speed and quantity of the aid
6857431 le prime medaglie doro olimpiche assegnate ad atleti del nord hanno certamente motivazioni di vario tipo nessuno per sembra avere il coraggio di dire la cosa pi ovvia ed evidente e cio che esse dimostrano la superiorit etnica dei padani anche in questo campo non si deve certo trarre da questa realt alcuna conseguenza di tipo razzista ma nessuno parimenti legittimato a ignorarla come stanno facendo i commentatori della rai pagati da noi

6857434 the first major evangelical critic of the new age movement
6857435 i started thinking i was looking at some very serious religious apostasy combined with some political elements
6857436 the books all sounded more like each other rather than the respective teachings of their respective denominations
6857437 it is time for more revelation and jesus is the flesh made messenger to bring that light to man but in the ages yet to come man will attain to greater lights and finally at last a mighty master soul will arise to light the way to the throne of i slammed that book shut i knew i just looked at something about and promoting and preparing folks for the antichrist
6857438 so help me i did not know that they had a slogan
6857439 how do i find pagans witches covens teachers in my area
6857440 is a popular saying in most pagan and craft communities
6857441 spaceship earth global village interdependence i had noticed this strong thread of mysticism both eastern and western running through it
6857442 convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that this may very well be what was described in the bible as the last political social movement that will bring the antichrist on the scene
6857443 oh yes thats very perceptive of you ive been convinced of that for many years myself
6857444 he shall honor in his estate a god of forces a god whom his fathers knew not
6857445 who is the liar but he who denies jesus is the christ is antichrist he that denies the father and the son and suddenly she warren had a mystic crystal revelation she told me too much and she started trying frantically to take it back
6857446 if not reversed these developments together with a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next year
6857447 we think the fed is going to be on hold until next year i think what you heard from bernanke was confirmation of that
6857448 it reduces the risk on both sides inflation and growth and that makes it more likely they will stand pat until they get a clear sense of which direction things will go

6857471 i think that there is a lot of excitement about the use of androgens male hormones to treat low sexual desire in women that is based on evidence that looks better than it really is
6857472 this area of research is being driven by the incredible profits that pharma companies are expecting given that one in three women in the us will rate herself as having low sexual desire
6857473 i think that there is a substantial body of evidence that hangs together very well that says that raising your level of androgen may well raise your risk of breast cancer

6857511 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
6857512 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
6857513 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
6857514 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed

6857559 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6857560 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6857561 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6857562 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6857563 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6857564 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6857565 mccain cant keep track and referred inquiring reporters to his staff
6857566 this is about shifting the power back to the people

6857573 i really miss doing as many interviews as i used to

6857575 a distinct venue to mix good food and lively political debate
6857576 its very ambitious and a huge commitment of resources i dont think by the end of fall anybody will be able to say cbs just talked about the polls and the candidates latest gaffes
6857577 talking to real people is one of my strong suits and hopefully this gives me a chance to get out its frustrating sometimes to be behind the desk all the time and not interacting with people and talking to them making people comfortable and guiding the interview and being a good listener
6857578 this will be an opportunity to do some of that
6857579 i think it is going to be a good game
6857580 you wouldnt want to play a team that you would probably run over you want to have a competitive game a game where you work your tail off to get the victory and you really earn it to meet a team like australia with some of the worlds best players it only solidifies the winner as the no 1 team
6857581 getting back is obviously the hardest part the game in two days if youve prepared yourself well enough and you go out there and earn it it will come you cant really control much from here on out
6857582 i think without a doubt its the two best teams in the world with some of the best players so its going to be a great game

6857585 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all
6857586 going to try to go dark to the extent that the characters allow it

6857616 almost half of all internet users now use search engines on a typical day
6857617 ubiquitous broadband has conditioned consumers to expect a more dynamic and engaging internet experience the search experience for the most part has not kept pace with the rest of the internet the days of serving up line after line of static text results are coming to an end as popularity familiarity and proficiency with internet search grows consumers will demand that search results pages have more video presentation and rich media interaction less drill down and deeper personalization theres no question internet search is long overdue for a facelift
6857618 i can only say that russia needs cooperation with nato no more than nato needs russia
6857619 after the famous nato meeting when the alliance froze contacts with russia some leading alliance officials were whispering in my ears you are not going to halt the afghanistan transit are you
6857620 it all depends on nato priorities if they prefer to support the bankrupt saakashvili regime to partnership with russia that will not be our fault
6857621 i know that the snake is still out there i just dont know where
6857622 there were no injuries and the cause is still under investigation

6857626 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6857627 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6857628 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6857629 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6857630 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6857631 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6857632 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6857633 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it

6857638 its a wonderfully eclectic objet dart speckled with an observable indifference for maureen dowd
6857639 i tried reading your blog but i couldnt fucking understand any of it
6857640 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6857641 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6857642 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6857643 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6857644 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6857645 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6857646 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6857647 the following adverse reactions have been reported in users of contraceptives and the association has neither been confirmed or refuted
6857648 what know you not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body for two says the lord shall be one flesh
6857649 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6857650 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6857651 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6857652 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6857653 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6857654 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6857655 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6857656 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6857657 if we use their tactics well lose the moral high ground
6857658 the fundamental basis of this nations laws was given to moses on the mount the fundamental basis of our bill of rights comes from the teachings we get from exodus and st matthew from isaiah and st paul
6857659 i dont think we emphasize that enough these days if we dont have a proper fundamental moral background we will finally end up with a totalitarian government which does not believe in rights for anybody except the state
6857660 a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor
6857661 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6857662 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6857663 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6857664 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6857665 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6857666 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6857667 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6857668 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6857669 the light volumes are really sort of the reasons behind why youve got some outsize moves i think the issues over all for the economy and the market are fairly well understood
6857670 the market is of this mind set that were going to continue to be flattish to down
6857671 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6857672 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6857673 thank you jesus i didnt i wanted to see it operate first
6857674 people got used to hearing something cool on a commercial and being like what band is this
6857675 if theyre out there really doing it if theyre playing at the echo then theyre not just being informed by how do i make this for a commercial theyre informed by their whole experience therefore you deliver something authentic
6857676 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6857677 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6857678 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6857679 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6857680 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6857681 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6857682 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6857683 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6857684 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6857685 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6857686 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6857687 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6857688 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6857689 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6857690 he tried to move away but was pushed onto the el track and landed on the third rail
6857691 the 3 d service called home which originally was expected to be sold starting last year now is expected to be available in the fall the company said

6857694 den unsichtbaren dritten in seiner ehe aus ihren gedanken zu l schen
6857695 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6857696 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6857697 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6857698 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6857699 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6857700 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6857701 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6857702 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6857703 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6857704 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6857705 his cousin said vincent was playing in the ditch and he was going to go back to call his friends to where he was playing
6857706 it doesnt appear she was speeding and she didnt have a stop sign
6857707 ball high is on the right track we have work to do no doubt but overall the staff is doing a good job
6857708 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6857709 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6857710 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6857711 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman

6857715 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6857716 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6857717 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6857718 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6857719 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6857720 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6857721 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6857722 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6857723 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6857724 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6857725 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6857726 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6857727 its going to be kind of a warm august weekend
6857728 rear their ugly heads again drying things out and lowering the humidity
6857729 pcm is going to make xip a lot more relevant
6857730 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6857731 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6857732 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6857733 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6857734 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6857735 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6857736 yes i do well to be angry angry enough to die
6857737 yes i do well to be angry angry enough to slam the door hang up the phone drive away not talk not answer the phone
6857738 love your enemies do good to those who hate you bless those who curse you if you love those who love you what benefit is that to you for even sinners love those who love them but love your enemies and you will be sons of the most high for he is kind to the ungrateful and the evil be merciful even as your father is merciful
6857739 put on then as gods chosen ones holy and beloved compassion kindness humility meekness and patience bearing with one another and if one has a complaint against another forgiving each other as the lord has forgiven you so you also must forgive
6857740 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6857741 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6857742 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6857743 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6857744 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6857745 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6857746 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6857747 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6857748 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6857749 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6857750 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6857751 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6857752 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6857753 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6857754 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6857755 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6857756 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6857757 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6857758 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6857759 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6857760 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6857761 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6857762 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6857763 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6857764 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6857765 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6857766 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6857767 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6857768 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6857769 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6857770 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6857771 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6857772 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6857773 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6857774 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6857775 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6857776 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6857777 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6857778 last week red hat detected an intrusion on certain of its computer systems and took immediate action while the investigation into the intrusion is on going our initial focus was to review and test the distribution channel we use with our customers red hat network rhn and its associated security measures based on these efforts we remain highly confident that our systems and processes prevented the intrusion from compromising rhn or the content distributed via rhn and accordingly believe that customers who keep their systems updated using red hat network are not at risk we are issuing this alert primarily for those who may obtain red hat binary packages via channels other than those of official red hat subscribers
6857779 we began working on hypoplastic left heart syndrome more than a decade ago
6857780 the genome wide approach is something that we anticipate will lead to major new insights into the causes of cardiovascular malformations
6857781 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6857782 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6857783 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6857784 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6857785 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6857786 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6857787 i cant wait to show it off at school its way better than having a playstation said rudra khurana a 14 year old delhi high school student standing next to his beaming father
6857788 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6857789 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6857790 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6857791 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6857792 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6857793 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6857794 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6857795 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6857796 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6857797 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6857798 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6857799 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6857800 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6857801 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6857802 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
6857803 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6857804 yes absolutely and i think its the games for nintendo
6857805 i think whatever price theyre at i think its the games that have really really driven it
6857806 we started off at the beginning of the year with gt5 prologue then we went to gta iv then metal gear solid therell be littlebigplanet and then we move onto pes and fifa and all those
6857807 were on rails and i think that those games are going to drive it
6857808 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6857809 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6857810 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6857811 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6857812 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6857813 sujit has been a great asset to igate sujit was key to the integration transformation and cost restructuring of igate and we are happy to appoint him as our new cfo
6857814 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6857815 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6857816 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6857817 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6857818 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6857819 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6857820 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
6857821 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
6857822 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6857823 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6857824 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6857825 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6857826 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6857827 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6857828 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6857829 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6857830 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6857831 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6857832 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6857833 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6857834 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
6857835 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6857836 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6857837 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6857838 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6857839 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6857840 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6857841 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6857842 f ramers of the constitution were concerned enough by the potential dangers of religion s influence on the government to mandate a separation of church and state
6857843 no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states
6857844 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
6857845 spencer ackerman does a great job of parroting what beauchamp has been saying all along and manages to get a few digs in at the man who fired him as well what he doesnt do is prove his case all in all perhaps his greatest accomplishment was getting this four page non revelation published
6857846 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6857847 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6857848 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6857849 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6857850 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6857851 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6857852 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6857853 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6857854 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6857855 i think i got cabin fever somebody sound the alarm

6857894 chelsea have a great squad a great team and their offer is good for me
6857895 it isnt because of money it is simply because i want to leave my personal aim is to be the best player in the world and that isnt going to be possible at real madrid
6857896 ive finished my cycle ive played three seasons at real madrid and have given everything
6857897 i have scored goals won two leagues and that isnt easy i think my period at real madrid has come to an end i hope the directors reach an agreement with chelsea to resolve my situation as quickly as possible
6857898 it would be harmful if he stayed at the club and wasnt happy about it because it would be bad for his career
6857899 i think that there are top drawer substitutes for robinho who could occupy both the left and the right wing we have top players to do that and coach bernd schuster knows this well
6857900 we owe it to the memory of our four colleagues to carry on
6857901 from 9 a m this morning the fighting has intensified with both sides using a lot of heavy guns including anti aircraft guns
6857902 my children and i took cover under our beds and we stayed for three hours till the situation subsided
6857903 there is a very harsh humanitarian crisis in the city
6857904 the fighting has displaced more than 5 500 people from the city

6857908 we think such a relationship would potentially be a material positive for google as it pursues market share and growth in a category that chairman and ceo eric schmidt recently described as possibly a bigger opportunity than the more traditional internet due largely to the number of mobile handset and devices worldwide
6857909 minutes before the official announcement of pope benedicts election cardinal macharski points to the liberal reporters assembled in st

6857912 the once every four years hope for the lever pull sensation of democratic power blinds people to the opportunities for democratic representation deliberation activism and change that surrounds us in local elections
6857913 bad for democracy how the presidency undermines the power of the people
6857914 even the best presidents need social movements to accomplish transformational change
6857915 fdr could not have succeeded without the agitation of the unemployed workers councils and the unions and lbjs greatest accomplishments were made possible by the civil rights movement
6857916 it is in vain to summon a people which has been rendered so dependent on the central power to choose from time to time the representatives of that power
6857917 this rare and brief exercise of their free choice however important it may be will not prevent them from gradually losing the faculties of thinking feeling and acting for themselves and thus gradually falling below the level of humanity
6857918 he was a devoted father who liked to share stories with his children colleagues and friends
6857919 an engineer reconnaissance team is a tight knit unit and these men were no exception they were a well trained highly motivated crew and believed in their mission as combat engineers they were proud resourceful and armed with technical knowledge they generously used in this mission to help the people of kandahar
6857920 these terrorist attacks will not change our resolution to help the people of afghanistan we are a great people and well face their awful attacks against our soldiers with courage and determination
6857921 the pullout was carried out without any incidents and was completed according to plan at 19 50 moscow time 11 50 a m edt
6857922 peacekeeping checkpoints in the security zone inside georgia have started carrying out the tasks set before them in this way the russian side has implemented the agreements set out by the presidents of russia and france
6857923 it is my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6857924 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6857925 the russians want to have eight peacekeeping checkpoints outside south ossetia but that is not agreed with us or with international mediators so it is not russias right to decide unilaterally how many checkpoints will be here
6857926 theyre all just saying what they think i want to hear
6857927 alternative energy is o k but we have to keep looking for oil its been around for a long time and its going to be around a long time

6857929 this is not a conversation of desperation this is a conversation of opportunity
6857930 but based on the numbers being thrown to me its 10 years before a viable wind farm can be built locally before its on the grid
6857931 im not sure what they can do im not sure what the answers are
6857932 but i wish they could find a way to make the price of gas o k or at least consistent
6857933 i dont think ronald reagan would recognize the party anymore
6857934 the party continues to try to prove ben franklin wrong trying to buy security by sacrificing liberty
6857935 i am not leaving the republican party as much as i believe the republican party left me
6857936 go to boston for your nobel prize come to missouri for your leg irons
6857937 you find yourself over time on many issues being more aligned with democrats
6857938 the main reason i left was the agenda and issues of the republicans in washington have been destroying the republican party
6857939 what ive been doing as long as ive been in the legislature is trying to articulate that moderate republican viewpoint
6857940 what i found is i may have a lot of ego but i dont think i have enough ego to think anymore that i can do it
6857941 how could i represent my district and tone down a record that ive had that has always been pro choice
6857942 have proven decisively that theyre masters in choosing names that are both highly unusual and carry a lot of personal meaning
6857943 theyve continued their own place naming tradition by naming their son after zuma beach in malibu
6857944 he was standing on zuma beach in the early morning after working all night as a production assistant on a music video and was quoted as saying he realized he was wasting his time
6857945 he drove up the coast slept in his car and started making the moves that would launch his career
6857946 this name obviously links to big brother kingstons and is another nod to jamaica and reggae
6857947 is not scheduled to be in the recording studio with britney
6857948 she kept eyeing justin but stopped short of actually walking over to say hello justin kept his back to her she was obviously waiting for him to turn around but he never did
6857949 when the concert was over jessica and justin left together and britney exited in the opposite direction
6857950 there are some very quick parts and almost everywhere theres a lot of room maybe similar to some of the north american circuits used in the past they have really done a good job
6857951 today our weekend got off to a good start but obviously it is far too early to say where we are compared to the opposition overtaking it will be difficult as always i hope i dont need to by getting the best position in qualifying the set up we have found today is not bad but there is still plenty of room for improvement
6857952 with the lap times tumbling bit by bit as the drivers lapped and got confidence in the track layout the track surface is still very dirty and it is easy to make mistakes which can lose you precious tenths to do a good lap time you have to be perfect
6857953 linux calls it oops but its basically equivalent to a windows blue screen
6857954 its kind of the same thing in terms of what causes it and what it does except we dont make it blue we just print the message
6857955 fedora is involved because we track the kernel very aggressively
6857956 the kerneloops capability also supports our dedication to a healthy cooperation with upstream software providers like the kernel developer community it leverages the widespread use of fedora for the direct benefit of that community who can see measurable results of their work and shift resources as needed to target frequent or important issues
6857957 in general kernel developers are open to kerneloops since the more reports i have the more data they have
6857958 if you have one report it could just be a fluke but if youve got 500 reports of the same pattern you know its a real bug
6857959 we are fixing the bugs that have a lot of people hitting them
6857960 if you look at the number of unique bugs the numbers can be confusing for the 2 6 25 kernel there were 1 300 bugs only half of which only happened once we do fix a lot of bugs but if you look at what we fix its the ones that actually matter
6857961 in a few months from now it might be something different
6857962 what kerneloops is doing is wonderful in helping the upstream kernel developers track what is going wrong and what needs to be fixed
6857963 of course more users testing the nightly kernel releases of the main kernel org tree is very helpful in finding problems that happen during the development cycle but that being said the linux kernel has a very good record of quality and stability over time
6857964 its important to track bugs and get visibility into what is causing them
6857965 but its also just one arrow in our quality improvement quiver
6857966 our technical advisory board and andrew morton recently starting tracking the
6857967 we plan on publishing a paper in the future that ranks the greatest bug finders and fixers by name
6857968 we certainly are seeing more interest in full size suvs and trucks over the last several weeks
6857969 remember we are in our eighth week of declining fuel prices in the u s
6857970 in may we were selling one truck for every one car we sold at our dealers and we had never been one to one it was always three trucks to two cars
6857971 however in june when ford came out with employee pricing things changed my theory is when something is cheap enough people buy it we began to see the trend for sales go back more toward trucks
6857972 july was really something we had our best truck month in the pittsburgh region since august 2007 that really blew our minds so the incentives combined with the reduction in gas prices greatly increased our truck sales
6857973 last month when you saw gas prices going down a little we noticed that the price and value reductions for big cars and trucks slowed down also the increases in the residual value of small cars leveled off too they are still increasing but at a reduced rate
6857974 our experience has been that american consumers adapt pretty rapidly to fuel price spikes and higher fuel prices i think people were initially shocked and there were some people who reacted in knee jerk fashion and said hey i gotta get out of my suv or hey i dont want to spend 100 for a tank of gas now people are starting to have a more rational take on all of this
6857975 residual values a new vehicles projected value after 36 months for trucks and full sized suvs declined at about twice the rate at which they normally declined over the last few months that was very steep
6857976 now things are starting to level out again some suvs like chevy tahoe ford expedition and toyota land cruiser had dropped by as much as 25 or 30 percent over a six month period of time those residual values have now stabilized
6857977 era uma quest o de honra o futebol vem para a olimp ada e voc espera uma medalha o futebol ganhar o bronze mais do que obriga o faz parte assim mesmo

6857985 its not just a smart home but a smart energy efficient home
6857986 as long as the couple has more homes than half sisters they could easily house one of the half sisters in each of the residences and keep them happy
6857987 however if the number of half sisters grows faster than the number of homes that could potentially lead to crowding
6857988 right now were trying to put it all on a spreadsheet
6857989 this is data that was held in secure form that was then downloaded onto a memory stick by an external contractor its completely unsatisfactory it runs against the rules set down both for the holding of government data and in fact set down by the external contractor

6857992 these microdomains are so tiny you could fit five million on them on a full stop there are 10 000 receptors on each cell and we are able to follow how single drug molecules bind to individual receptors in these specialised microdomains
6857993 what makes this single molecule laser technique unique is that we are looking at them in real time on a living cell other techniques that investigate how drugs bind to their receptors require many millions of cells to get a big enough signal and this normally involves destroying the cells in the process

6858040 like a hurricane or some other natural disaster these people are not innocent victims they made bad financial decisions and now are paying the price for it we own 2 houses one here in california and one back home in kansas why should i feel guilty about the good financial decisions that we have made that have allowed us to pay our bills and be economically stable
6858041 fairly superficial gags rather than detailed self important analyses because i cant hope to get into serious depth in the limited time and space available
6858042 from the newspaper we started the idea was that you consume the regular media and then you have a chaser which is why the original logo was a shot glass people now think its because we chase people it might be more accurate to say we drive them to drink
6858043 it started off as fundamentally nietzschean only with ourselves as the supermen but since then weve gotten much more arrogant
6858044 i liked it when craig gatecrashed the 2001 liberal victory party as the race card with a picture of the tampa on his chest not just because it was the right point to make and they really really hated it but because the security guys were actually really rough with him which was great fun for the rest of us
6858045 its far more fun and you get to meet lots of new people some of whom may even like your work you are also less likely to meet reporters from today tonight on the downside you cant do another take when you stuff up on the upside audiences seem to like laughing at us as well as with us
6858046 absolutely nothing its perfect in every way although it would be fair to say that because in the australian media you inevitably have to work at some point for news acp or fairfax i would never dream of criticising the current arrangements
6858047 i think we are analogous to the desert bits our humour tends to be both very dry and ultimately empty
6858048 its strength is that there is room for an amusing prankster like the no pokies mp nick xenophon to get into parliament its weakness is that theres also room for an unamusing prankster like bill heffernan
6858049 its already been completely defined by the work of rolf harris and due to our lesser proficiency with the lagerphone and wobbleboard we have nothing further to add
6858050 bert and patti newton are the king and queen of this nation and as far as im concerned the onus is on the british royal family to prove otherwise after all how many gold logies has queen elizabeth won
6858051 im not sure whether the afp commissioner is allowed to issue retrospective pardons to my chaser colleague but id certainly be looking into that secondly i reckon canberra due to its roundabouts would be awesome for doughnuts and my officers would never dream of arresting me and finally id also follow on from those ever so worthwhile bill henson investigations by storming any premises containing images by may gibbs whose portrayal of young provocatively dressed children is nothing more than immoral titillation for the nations paedophiles and gumnut aficionados
6858052 weve discovered that the best way to get established in the australian media is to start an unprofitable satirical newspaper for 5 years and hope that during that period someone somehow notices and is foolish enough to give you a job making a television show other than that we have little wisdom to pass on since pretty much everything weve ever done has essentially been the result of dumb luck
6858053 people risk freezing to death or falling in the water
6858054 we promised last year to return if the promises werent kept
6858055 capture the heat the cold of the mountains the sense of the society the range of the classes of the people the gypsy girls versus the spanish girls and the sense of the elements fire water wind rain i wanted to do a realistic carmen
6858056 when working in tv you have people telling you what you can and cant do
6858057 the little suit guy who sits in the office saying i dont get it
6858058 people who cant do teach people who cant teach program television
6858059 is that as far as the network is concerned tv shows are things that are made so that people will watch the advertisements
6858060 if a joke falls flat in the woods and theres no one there to laugh at it does it make it funny
6858061 verdis portrait of gustav iii of sweden as a rule is anything but flattering
6858062 at the same time this is not the portrait of a fool
6858063 a lot of women have troubles with confidence in relation to stand up because it is such a public thing
6858064 but obviously i was wrong it was stand up i thought why not im here ill give it a go
6858065 although i wasnt a class clown i was a nerd at school
6858066 ive always liked to laugh and ive always liked public speaking
6858067 and not talked to as if they understand whats going on we dont bullshit them or talk down to their level we treat young people as though they know whats going on and they have control over their own lives
6858068 the wanky writer part of me really likes deconstructing it
6858069 catherine deneuve is the living embodiment of all that is great about frances film industry
6858070 her visit will make the 2008 a profoundly memorable occasion
6858071 i was scared i wouldnt be able to stand it that i wouldnt be able to take it on
6858072 catherine asked the right questions about the role the screenplay and her ability to commit to a subject like this
6858073 i was more or less inspired by something that happened in the small village where im from
6858074 kids coming home from a nightclub had a car accident one of them was killed and his mother totally rejected the other passengers who survived i imagined the contrary
6858075 mourning has to be done it has to be experienced
6858076 but she camille decides to get on with things very fast which has its dangers especially for her she didnt have a choice if she hadnt done it she would have been crushed by the weight of her grief
6858077 making her son live through franck is her way of seeing and experiencing what he could have been what he should have been and what he could have become
6858078 four years ago i didnt think it would happen but now i am pretty sure it will
6858079 i am definitely focusing on my own thing but in my opinion the phish thing is pretty likely at this point because people are so healthy and enthusiastic about it among the band members the vibe is really good
6858080 i dont know exactly but soon enough well have a better idea
6858081 come together to enrich the bands life and our life
6858082 you felt like watching phish perform was part of something you did together with the band thats unique in art and music
6858083 young man aged 50 looking for occasional massage students welcome

6858123 how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for god was with him and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews and in jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree him god raised up the third day and showed him openly not to all the people but unto witnesses chosen before of god even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead
6858124 and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ
6858125 wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among us beginning from the baptism of john unto that same day that he was taken up from us must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection
6858126 forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us
6858127 ye are my witnesses saith the lord and my servant whom i have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that i am he before me there was no god formed neither shall there be after me
6858128 before the mountains were brought forth or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world even from everlasting to everlasting thou art god
6858129 nay but o man who art thou that repliest against god shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast thou made me thus hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor
6858130 ye are my witnesses saith the lord and my servant whom i have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that i am he before me there was no god formed neither shall there be after me
6858131 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made through him and without him was not any thing made that was made
6858132 no man hath seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him
6858133 so also christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest but he that said unto him thou art my son today have i begotten thee
6858134 but unto them which are called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god
6858135 therefore also said the wisdom of god i will send them prophets and apostles and some of them they shall slay and persecute
6858136 the lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old i was set up from everlasting from the beginning or ever the earth was when there were no depths i was brought forth when there were no fountains abounding with water before the mountains were settled before the hills was i brought forth while as yet he had not made the earth nor the fields nor the highest part of the dust of the world when he prepared the heavens i was there when he set a compass upon the face of the depth when he established the clouds above when he strengthened the fountains of the deep when he gave to the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the earth then i was by him as one brought up with him and i was daily his delight rejoicing always before him rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth and my delights were with the sons of men
6858137 how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for god was with him and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews and in jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree him god raised up the third day and showed him openly not to all the people but unto witnesses chosen before of god even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead
6858138 but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth

6858141 peningkatan kualitas pendidikan menjadi hal yang sangat penting bagi pemerintah untuk ke depan
6858142 pemerintah harus fokus pada pembinaan generasi muda yang bakal masuk ke pasar kerja sejak mereka masih sekolah mereka sangat berpotensi dan mampu menyerap berbagai hal yang bisa meningkatkan kompetensi dan keahliannya sesuai kebutuhan pasar kerja
6858143 minimnya kompetensi dan keahlian lulusan sekolah formal terlihat dalam bursa bursa kerja yang semakin sering diselenggarakan sejak tahun 2006 meskipun peminat setiap bursa membeludak hampir 30 persen lowongan kerja yang tersedia tidak terisi karena pelamar tidak memenuhi kriteria pemberi kerja artinya lapangan kerja tersedia kompetensi peminat tak memenuhi persyaratan yang diminta
6858144 tahun 2008 setiap 1 persen pertumbuhan ekonomi menambah 702 000 tenaga kerja tetapi ada tren semakin besar yang masuk ke sektor informal padahal yang dibutuhkan adalah penyerapan tenaga kerja pada sektor formal
6858145 jika asumsi itu dipakai pula pada penambahan tenaga kerja baru artinya dari 702 000 tenaga kerja baru yang bertambah setiap 1 persen pertumbuhan hanya sekitar 210 000 tenaga kerja yang masuk ke sektor formal
6858146 the government told us we had the right to protest

6858172 my point being that when election time comes were going to need somebody to take care of the soldiers not somebody who wants another war
6858173 this is the greatest country in the world and we cant take care of our folks
6858174 our guys did not find any powder there were maybe a couple of grains of something inside an envelope and they had to kind of work to get a sample
6858175 it was described to me as maybe they found a couple of granules of something it tested positive for protein what was described to me as a weak positive well protein could be a protein shake
6858176 people are now talking about the same idea in the same language
6858177 it has the potential to get police officers all amped up and looking for a confrontation at a time when what we need is cool heads and restraint
6858178 we would be remiss if we did not take measures to protect the public
6858179 it just says be on the lookout be aware thats all it does
6858180 was that they were trying to intimidate us into not going to any protests and to let us know that hey were watching you
6858181 are people that we identified that could reasonably be expected to have knowledge of such plans and plots if they existed
6858182 this kind of pressure has a real chilling effect on perfectly legitimate political activity
6858183 people are going to be afraid to go to a demonstration or even sign a petition if they justifiably believe that will result in your having an f b i file opened on you
6858184 we do not add any sugar to this drink the sugar is already included the mix
6858185 colleges are experimenting with facebook and other social networks to notify students about emergencies like crimes and floods and get vital information in return most emergency alert systems send out warnings but social networks give students a chance to add on the scene reports or trade information if trouble hits in addition to cell phone and e mail alerts the social networks also give colleges yet another way to reach students in a crisis

6858206 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
6858207 people thought it was a little strange that we were concerned about recycling our construction waste and we paid attention to things like energy efficiency and dust removal
6858208 everybody wants a healthy home whether theyre building a new house or just adding on a room
6858209 ideally he or she has spent time learning about everything from the best way to insulate a particular wall to how to keep dust at a minimum
6858210 contracting is evolving what we call green practices now will be the everyday way to do business in a few more years
6858211 many contractors who arent comfortable with green practices will give you a very high quote to discourage you from your plans
6858212 or theyll look at it as a marketing opportunity without really doing much environmentally which is known as greenwashing
6858213 there are around 120 individual materials that are used to make a kitchen and if you or a family member is sensitive to one of them you may have a problem living there
6858214 fortunately we have healthier substitutes like low voc volatile organic compound adhesives and other products that work just as well
6858215 any visible dust needs to be cleaned up and extensive sawing or cutting should be conducted in a well ventilated area
6858216 it goes without saying that if youre checking out a room the contractors demolishing or remodeling wear a mask
6858217 not necessarily most good green contractors can work within your budget
6858218 for a simple room addition you could spend 2 to 4 more than you had planned and end up with a very environmentally friendly project
6858219 we are communicating to customers around the country making sure that were answering any questions concerning it

6858224 i really miss doing as many interviews as i used to
6858225 i think theres something about the web vibe and i know that makes me sound very out of it to use the word vibe but im looking forward to being able to have more casual but hopefully hard hitting coverage if thats not too counter intuitive
6858226 a distinct venue to mix good food and lively political debate
6858227 its very ambitious and a huge commitment of resources i dont think by the end of fall anybody will be able to say cbs just talked about the polls and the candidates latest gaffes
6858228 talking to real people is one of my strong suits and hopefully this gives me a chance to get out its frustrating sometimes to be behind the desk all the time and not interacting with people and talking to them making people comfortable and guiding the interview and being a good listener
6858229 this will be an opportunity to do some of that

6858498 basically right now if youre a student in canada lets say you graduated and had a three year work permit the only way you could stay here permanently is if you were nominated by your province
6858499 there was no reason for them to stay here or come here to study in the first place they were going to go to the countries that would offer them permanent residency after the completion of their studies
6858500 in our view these are significant reforms and will go quite a ways to placing canada on more equal footing with competitor countries in terms of positioning us as a destination of choice for international students

6858502 the introduction of our australian style points system will ensure that only those with skills the country needs can come
6858503 canadas being a lot more strategic and focused on global competitiveness than we are
6858504 when you look across the scope of whats going on in congress and the agencies were not thinking about this strategically were tying it to a program that dhs is trying to mandate on all employers for employment verification thats how were thinking about this
6858505 its not entirely obvious what the best way to do this is
6858506 what i do know is that other nations around the world who are our competitors are simply making the decision to attract talent by increasing the likelihood that people can believe they will be employed in that country by the end of the completion of the degree our system is currently set up to convey precisely the opposite message you have to promise to return home in order to get a visa
6858507 well be looking at it well be monitoring it however we still have premier academic programs here at wayne state so even with all those different enticements students are still coming here to get an education from a research i institution

6858579 many fish are hard to tell apart once theyve been filleted and packaged
6858580 we hope our work lights the way to getting mislabelled and endangered fish species out of grocery store refrigerators and frying pans
6858581 this not only raises concerns of consumer fraud but also public health
6858582 we are not certain where the mislabelling occurs but it seems it is not the fishermen since the mislabelled fish are from completely different parts of the world
6858583 perhaps the mislabelling occurs somewhere in the middle when the fish are filleted and no longer easily identifiable

6858589 this is my only job this is my life actually
6858590 we have a lot who are returning who are very successful with the experience and skills the country needs but of course the salary is not there
6858591 a lot of them are even leaving family behind but theyre making these sacrifices to come back and help the development of the country
6858592 i do not like to talk about politics all that i like to do is business business and business all over the world we talk about gender equality and one way to promote this is to help women entrepreneurs
6858593 many people here have this resistance factor to returnees because they feel that unlike those in the diaspora they themselves stayed here throughout the war and suffered and now they should get all the jobs
6858594 they see it in your face you look fresh and wholesome and they hear it in my accent i probably have to be living here five years before people accept me
6858595 its like all of it was inside waiting to burst out for so long i am african and that in itself is a statement its the idea you carry yourself in your clothes you wear the pride of the textile
6858596 i think what i am doing is in line with anyone coming here to open a school or a hospital i know it is enriching this country

6858610 one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
6858611 also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells
6858612 because extractions of wisdom teeth are commonly operated in dental clinics we can expect a lot of donors of stem cells
6858613 that enable us to create stem cells of various genetic codes eliminating the risk that a body of a patient would reject transplanted tissues or organs

6858625 the public should really recognize the science is really behind what we have said the obvious stares you in the face
6858626 they should put their eyes out so they cant commit any more crimes
6858627 prison isnt a solution anymore they just form their own gangs inside prison and come out stronger

6858632 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6858633 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6858634 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues

6858654 but obviously it is going to be the prime ministers call so this is a chance for me to sit there with him
6858655 we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a final and successful conclusion
6858656 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people that respects iraqi sovereignty that allows us to lay the kind of foundation that we need to make sure that we complete the work that weve all sacrificed so greatly to see accomplished
6858657 it will be an excellent agreement when we finally have agreement
6858658 mayor bloomberg if he wants to run for mayor a third time i think thats a great idea

6858671 o nosso time tem que jogar sempre com a corda esticada n o podemos relaxar nunca

6858674 eles conversar o com outros pilotos natural mas estou muito feliz com minha posi o na equipe rubens um companheiro acho que ele fant stico tem feito um bom trabalho e d uma resposta excelente provavelmente melhor que qualquer outro piloto l fora
6858675 ent o tenho certeza de que qualquer que seja a decis o da equipe ser dif cil
6858676 obviamente um pouco antes de rubens chegar perguntaram me quem achava competitivo e quem seria um bom companheiro e listei alguns pilotos e rubens era um deles
6858677 ainda muito dedicado para melhorar o carro e como diz ross brawn est no melhor de sua pilotagem
6858678 ele tem feito um bom trabalho realmente neste ano em especial pois ele teve alguns timos desempenhos acho que todos ficariam muito decepcionados se fosse o caso mas ningu m mais que o pr prio rubens

6858891 the united states maintained about 130 military advisers in georgia along with civilian advisers contractors involved in all aspects of the georgian government and people doing business in georgia it is inconceivable that the americans were unaware of georgias mobilization and intentions it is also inconceivable that the americans were unaware that the russians had deployed substantial forces on the south ossetian frontier u s technical intelligence from satellite imagery and signals intelligence to unmanned aerial vehicles could not miss the fact that thousands of russian troops were moving to forward positions the russians clearly knew the georgians were ready to move how could the united states not be aware of the russians indeed given the posture of russian troops how could intelligence analysts have missed the possibility that the russians had laid a trap hoping for a georgian invasion to justify its own counterattack

6858918 the gesture will not make hamas more flexible about its demands because the organization sees that israel is releasing prisoners with blood on their hands which merely causes hamas to harden its position
6858919 hamas is looking despairingly at how despite the fact that it holds shalit it is not succeeding in bringing about a prisoner release while abu mazen abbas who is conducting negotiations with israel is securing a prisoner release

6858994 sports provide a positive environment that may enhance the physical growth and psychological development of children
6858995 however the pressures to succeed can be so strong that parents will go to great lengths to ensure their children get the best training and will finance the most direct path to success this commitment to high level training comes with risks including premature injuries and burnout

6858997 cross training in sports that emphasize different muscle groups are ideal for children
6858998 children who participate in a variety of sports lessen their risk of overtraining

6859000 many canadians were encouraged by the conservatives apparent new restraint shown in their third budget that limited spending growth to 3 4 per cent this fiscal year well so much for that in the first three months spending is instead up two and a half times what these so called fiscally responsible conservatives in ottawa budgeted it to be
6859001 the conservatives continue to claim they will still hit 3 4 per cent in spending growth for the year but theyve proven throughout their term in office that they cant stop themselves from spending
6859002 the government is committed to keeping the growth of program expenses below the growth of the economy over the medium term
6859003 our new economic plan proposes to keep the growth rate of program spending on average below the rate of growth in the economy
6859004 to the extent spending growth is kept below the growth in the economy this will contribute to further reductions in public debt and in taxes given the commitment to dedicate interest savings to tax reductions
6859005 the message is clear tax and debt reductions are conditional on spending restraint the conservatives have gone on a spending binge that hamstrings their ability to lower personal income taxes and reduce debt

6859056 id love to ask why you dont use a vacuum cleaner but i have a feeling youd tell me you wouldnt know what to do with the time youd save or something like that
6859057 well ive never seen it of course but mother said that under a freshly vacuumed rug thered be a huge layer of dirt on top of wood flooring and that it destroyed the finish of the floor and the back of the rug

6859069 these are some of the boldest changes weve ever made
6859070 it is a shift in the business model for our sellers and for ebay we are asking sellers to rethink their listing strategies and giving them economic incentives to do that
6859071 we are really recognizing e commerce in general and what our buyers are seeing anywhere else online
6859072 it is going to make the process faster and more reliable
6859073 we think auctions really work for unique items rare items hard to find items or one of a kind in demand items
6859074 we are shifting most of the fees onto the back end but we think that with the change in our listing fee we are extremely competitive
6859075 the goal is to be the most competitively priced site on the web
6859076 amazon has been cutting pretty heavily into ebay sales and amazons growth has been going phenomenally
6859077 i think the bloom is off the auction a bit by and large people want to be able to go in and get things quickly

6859086 our take home message today is the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no mystery it did not collapse from explosives or fuel oil fires
6859087 how much longer do we have to endure the cover up of how building 7 was destroyed
6859088 we are not seeing that they are in compliance right now
6859089 they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that

6859117 democrats continue to miss the simple fact that hard working american families want real solutions to their pain at the pump and unlike federal bureaucrats dont have the luxury of requesting a four day work week
6859118 instead they have to take their children to school or practices and drive to work with the hopes of earning enough money to file their tank for next weeks commute americans deserve more than this part time democratic leadership has or is willing to give

6859250 four years ago just 30 of conservatives believed that churches and other houses of worship should stay out of politics today 50 of conservatives express this view
6859251 the survey suggests that frustration and disillusionment among social conservatives may be a part of the reason why a greater number now think that religious institutions should keep out of politics however there is little to suggest that social conservatives want religion to be a less important element in american politics
6859252 despite their increased reluctance to see religious institutions speaking out on politics conservatives and republicans continue to express very strong support for a religious president and relatively high levels of support for expressions of religious faith and prayer by political leaders

6859276 the wrath of god is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness since what may be known about god is plain to them because god has made it plain to them for since the creation of the world gods invisible qualities his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen being understood from what has been made so that men are without excuse
6859277 too often unbelievers get the impression that christianity is an irrational faith that requires people to suspend their critical reasoning faculty

6859283 humanity should accept that science has eliminated the justification for believing in cosmic purpose and that any survival of purpose is inspired only by sentiment

6859288 i was ambushed by the amount and quality of the evidence that jesus is the unique son of god the cumulative facts and data pointed unmistakeably toward a conclusion that i was not entirely comfortable in reaching
6859289 god resonates in all of us but he explodes our paradigms he confronts us in the face with our only hope being in christ
6859290 we must not only present reasons and proclaim the gospel but we must also be at prayer depending upon god to bring his word with the full power and conviction of the holy spirit 1 thess 1v4 5

6859325 we all have the same egyptian blood and if the purpose of the measure is to prohibit the traffic of organs we reject it because that could occur as well among the faithful of the same religion
6859326 we fear that in the future there will be hospitals for christians and hospitals for muslims
6859327 to protect poor muslim from rich christians who buy their organs and vice versa
6859328 to prevent any attempt to deceive the infirm and rob them of their organs especially if this occurs between christians and muslims because in this case it does open the door to a crisis between both communities
6859329 our main science goal is to understand the large scale structure of the universe
6859330 this instrument can help us understand the composition of this cosmic web including how galaxies like our own milky way formed and evolved over time
6859331 there are hundreds or thousands of new targets in our sights that are just too faint to image with hubbles other instruments
6859332 the opportunity to do great science was very clear to everyone in the astronomical community

6859354 this is the iraqi governments view and what the government wants
6859355 well have agreement when we have agreement so all of those stories in the newspapers about what the agreement says probably ought to be disregarded until we have an agreement
6859356 there are dates which will depend on the situation on the ground and the decisions of the iraqi government according to security developments and according to the need of the iraqis
6859357 the president and every american wants to see american troops come home but not until the job is done and there is more security more political progress and more economic progress inside iraq
6859358 are you the one who is coming or should we look for someone else

6859361 em cumprimento dos princ pios do acordo estabelecido em moscovo entre medvedev e o presidente franc s nicolas sarkozy

6859364 das zonas consideradas como territ rio indiscut vel da ge rgia
6859365 n o somos apenas n s os americanos que o esperamos s o os franceses a uni o europeia francamente acho que o mundo inteiro espera isso

6859367 gt a company in pennsylvania is recalling batches of kerosene sold this past summer for fears that some may contain gas making it a very flammable mixture
6859368 the msa of the university of southern california became a focal point of this effort to repudiate the genocidal hadith about muslims killing jews to bring on the end times because it hosts a major online hadith collection here which of course included the genocidal hadith when this was brought to the attention of usa provost c l max nikias he declared that the passage cited is truly despicable the passage in the hadith that you brought to our attention violates the usc principles of community and it has no place on a usc website said nikias i have ordered that the passage be removed you can see a pdf of his letter here the usc msa complied
6859369 there was an agreement in 2005 in which we both made certain commitments we have delivered on all of ours now the americans have to deliver the nsg
6859370 work with friends and allies to adjust international regimes to enable full civil nuclear energy cooperation and trade with india
6859371 participating governments exchanged views in a constructive manner and agreed to meet again in the near future to continue their deliberations
6859372 i think the whole thing will be reformulated but in a positive way
6859373 there was a reference in the earlier u s draft to the desirability of india eventually accepting the npt and its safeguards that was more positive than what we have now
6859374 so i think america will have to come back to us with a new draft before any decision is possible
6859375 if there is a view that for various political reasons we should not be there or what we are trying to do should be altered which cannot be then we would necessarily face an issue very reluctantly where we need to move
6859376 if anybody is under the impression that because we have made this large investment of about rs 1 500 crore we will not move then they are wrong we would move whatever the cost to protect our people what has concerned us is the violence and the disruption that has led us to be concerned about the safety of our employees our equipment and of the viability of the entire process
6859377 compound walls are being broken materials stolen you cannot open and operate a plant with police protection
6859378 please understand that i am making a very genuine statement and i do not have a motive
6859379 great loss to the company its shareholders and west bengal
6859380 we came at a time when there was very little investment coming to west bengal and the tata motors decided to locate one of their prime and most unique factory in west bengal we wanted to showcase the new industrialisation of west bengal
6859381 we leased property which was offered to us that had been acquired and as we were looking for a unique product with low cost we wanted an integrated location as logistics and transportation are major components of cost for any project we are trying to produce a car that has never been tried anywhere in the world at that kind of price
6859382 we do not want anyone to go away from bengal
6859383 i am sorry but you know the nsgs proceedings are strictly confidential
6859384 by the time we came in the briefing was already over
6859385 so could you please tell me what is indias answer when some countries say you must commit to eventually signing the npt
6859386 we hope to impress upon our high command that the samiti has the unconditional support of all sections of the people of jammu
6859387 we expected to do 3 27 50 for the seasons best i was running third and the lead was too much to catch up everyone is not at the same level
6859388 i tried my best we wanted to clock our best time and make the final the attempt was to run all out and come below 3 27 we have only managed to do what we did in qualifying for the olympics 3 28
6859389 place the matter inflation and base year effect in perspective
6859390 headline inflation continues to be a matter of concern the point to be stressed is that the inflation rate for each group in the wpi is measured on an annual point to point basis hence it is largely influenced by the trend in the corresponding week of the previous year which is the base year
6859391 this trend of a declining wpi continued up to november 24 2007
6859392 the prices of edible oils rose by 15 per cent as there was hardening of prices globally since more than 60 per cent of demand is met through imports
6859393 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6859394 we have sent a project to the ministry of environment and forest to conduct a census of sparrows
6859395 there is total apathy over the issue of dwindling sparrows due to lack of any kind of national data on the bird
6859396 you are unlikely to see games of this stature ever again
6859397 ioc president jacque rogge says that the games must leave a legacy the u k government recognises this is once in a lifetime opportunity our priority is to leave a legacy for the community we will deliver a spectacular games
6859398 you only have one opportunity to observe a working model close up like this we have grasped it with both hands these have been a supremely well delivered games it has been an extraordinarily useful learning curve for our observation teams
6859399 the detailed planning and execution has inspired us it demonstrates the potential of the games to energise the international population and the intrinsic values of sport
6859400 i think the challenge is to bring the games to life after the opening ceremony and deliver the excitement that is expected something spectacular
6859401 the games are about the athletes they give up half their young lives to prepare for this you have to create the perfect climate for them to perform
6859402 you must get the details right the transport the security the accommodation the attention to detail has been extraordinary the athletes are being transported virtually to the side of the track at the stadium no stone has been left unturned
6859403 the british police have a very good record in this area it is a huge global capital city there will be a balance the games must be enjoyable and the city will not be locked down
6859404 we have seen some extraordinary sport it has been a magnificent success i think people see this and get the idea of how powerful the olympics can be
6859405 we are going for a peaceful movement no doubt about it but it is the state governments duty to ensure a peaceful movement
6859406 mr tata are you listening to me land at singur has been forcibly acquired please accept the advice of the people of the area and return the 400 acres to the farmers we are pleading for both industry and agriculture so that people in industry and agriculture can smile
6859407 there is still a solution to the stalemate we have a one point programme let there be agriculture as well as industry
6859408 whatever benefits have been given to the tatas should be given to other industrialists there are so many industrialists why just one
6859409 rs 1 500 crore is nothing to you you have lakhs of crores of rupees why have you not invested thousands and thousands of crores to bengal earlier
6859410 i fought him once in bulgaria and i won so this time i had to change my tactics because he already knows me i had to surprise him
6859411 i tried to do my best in the second round but my opponent was good he was using his left which was his strongest point when you are trailing with a difference of two points it is very difficult to catch up against such a quality opponent it was his day i am disappointed not to reach the final
6859412 i am happy that we have a breakthrough we finally have won an olympic medal in boxing for india our three boxers reached the quarterfinals for the first time we have shown that we are something in international boxing
6859413 i am happy for winning the bronze i believe that boxing will go up in india after this we made good progress in these games i will work hard next time and i will win against him
6859414 such military exercises are part of the growing military collaboration with the u s which is resorting to aggressive military operations in afghanistan iraq and now targeting iran
6859415 when you say the inamdar judgment provides for entering into agreement why do you need our approval
6859416 this approval by us will open floodgates and we dont want to do that
6859417 land acquired so far is now assessed as sufficient for the pipeline projects
6859418 we have decided to impose curfew in hiranagar as there is a danger of the situation worsening
6859419 sadly it companies are under no obligation to manage their waste because india does not have legislation for e waste
6859420 none of the existing environmental laws have any direct reference to electronic waste or refer to its handling as hazardous in nature
6859421 we are not receiving an adequate amount of e waste we need more companies to cooperate
6859422 electronic equipment are being discarded at a greater rate than ever before because of advances in technology changes in fashion and machinery reaching the end of their lifespan
6859423 for instance no one has any idea what government departments of telecom railways civil aviation and defence all of which rely on electronic equipment are doing with their e waste they are most likely going to backyard recyclers or informal sector traders
6859424 viajar puede representar tomarse unos merecidos d as de descanso de la vida cotidiana pero tambi n puede significar todo lo contrario al posibilitarnos sumergirnos de lleno en el mundo conocer sus culturas y las problem ticas sociales que ser an imposibles de conocer desde el living de casa
6859425 conocer los lugares m s ex ticos de la forma m s natural
6859426 no es lo mismo tener unas vacaciones de 15 d as en la india que vivir 2 a os y medio y aunque nunca me gust me adapte
6859427 viajar a dedo nos lleva a tener como mejor gu a de turismo a la misma gente del lugar abri ndonos un abanico infinito de posibilidades de historias en la ruta
6859428 cuando en el banco declaro que soy trabajadora sexual me ponen ama de casa

6859430 did they not know then that the congress had seen electoral reverses in some states was the defeat of the congress in some states the real reason for the marxists to withdraw their support was the nuclear deal issue a manufactured reason
6859431 it is a different ground and it will be a different atmosphere
6859432 what ive heard is this wicket plays a little slow and it helps spinners obviously as a player i look forward to playing on any wicket
6859433 being dropped in the second odi was just about the combination of the team i am prepared to give my best here
6859434 sorry hunny i was gonna pull out but the phone rang and startled me
6859435 but i just found that its not as black and white as i originally thought
6859436 it had become the culture in his neighborhood to visit igor to get your bike people accepted it
6859437 it was gods way of saying its time to put a stop to this
6859438 he made a lot of money off it judging by where he was living
6859439 the public reaction is a bit extreme and knee jerk
6859440 you just get pulled completely in when you start talking to him
6859441 with the changing neighborhood i knew that it would culminate in igor being pushed out im just shocked at the number of bikes and storage facilities and the quantity of drugs is just ridiculous
6859442 1 the myth of jewish communism is only a myth
6859443 the goal of morpheme has always been to streamline the animation production pipeline offering faster development times and higher fidelity
6859444 we selected nvidias physx technology because out of all commercial physics engines it offers the highest character grade fidelity an essential requirement for creating believable characters
6859445 naturalmotions technology marks a turning point in gaming its fidelity of movement makes characters seem so real that you want to touch them and the physx integration lets you do just that
6859446 we bestuderen een aantal opties en staan open voor alle mogelijkheden daartoe behoort ook een overname van lehman
6859447 reforms will start by a new administration structure and end with a popular contract which will keep the jamahiriyah system in place but with a new form that is different from the bad initial one
6859448 now we want to agree on laws that rule us in the future the era now is different we want a new administrative system law and a constitution for once and all that do not change each time
6859449 we are living in a forest ruled by dictatorships and hereditary regimes that trample human rights all are dictatorships with fictitious parliaments and constitutions
6859450 it should be an example and a model in the middle east
6859451 we arabs have become a mockery with pervasive torture and sites of secret prisons
6859452 the train of reforms is on track it has not reached its final stop but it is on a good track to arrive
6859453 i had played a role in diplomacy in government in development policy and other things because libya has no institutions to do that
6859454 second only to martin luther king jr s march on
6859455 it is better to live as if there is a god and die to find that there is not than to live as if there is not a god and die to find out that there is
6859456 live as if there is yaweh but die to find there is allah
6859457 it was also said whoever divorces his wife let him give her a certificate of divorce but i say to you that every one who divorces his wife except on the ground of unchastity makes her an adulteress and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery
6859458 you have heard that it was said you shall not commit adultery but i say to you that everyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart if your right eye causes you to sin pluck it out and throw it away it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell and if your right hand causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell
6859459 realism is not a matter of showing real things but of showing how things really are
6859460 be dubious about the potential for a change in this world order the rich are too rich and the poor too poor for anything to really change
6859461 we may be lucky that we can withdraw from society but we are also unlucky insofar as that same society cannot be changed into one from which we feel no need to withdraw
6859462 in their feeding frenzy why dont pirhanas eat each other
6859463 who would demand a comfortable soul when an ape looks into a mirror dont be surprised if no swan appears
6859464 the himalayas have a lot of meteorites lying on the ground because the air is so thin they cant burn up
6859465 jesus in the school playground getting the shit kicked out of him
6859466 what will it take for you to fight back jc
6859467 i was warrior so my son could be a farmer so his son could be a poet
6859468 the u s attorneys office said he logged on from his chestnut hill home his vacation home kyw and another location and then leaked information including attorney client privileged information relating to both criminal litigation in which lane was involved in new york and civil litigation lane brought against kyw in philadelphia to at reporter at the philadelphia daily news
6859469 mendte admitted that he illegally viewed hundreds of alycia lanes e mails from march 2006 to may 2008 at a time when leaked information about her personal life contributed to her downfall
6859470 let me get this straight you are boasting about the effectiveness of abstinence based teaching based on a study that essentially says that twelve year olds who make a pledge of abstinence are 21 more likely to hold off on sex for three years i e until theyre fifteen congratulations so exactly how many more is 21
6859471 if i told you you could increase your income by 21 youd be very happy 21 fewer teen pregnancies in any group is a good start
6859472 unfortunately increasing my income by 21 doesnt help me im unemployed so being a 21 increase on nothing no i would not be much happier that is the problem with just using percentages when you do not have the raw numbers that give them context it is easy to make a growth sound significant by sticking to percentages also were talking about abstinence not teen pregnancies related yes but there is a difference an increase in the usage of condoms would also reduce pregnancies
6859473 thanks ill be taking your advice to heart im sure it will be a lot of help then when florida comes out of a statewide recession and there is actually a demand for labor as not even fast food chains have been hiring your 21 will finally become statistically significant and by the time you are done reading this i will have a 1 7 sextrillion percent increase in my income

6859475 mas a pr pria constitui o nos deu a receita para corrigir aquilo com que todos nos preocup vamos que era a amea a de o brasil se transformar de novo num estado policial
6859476 o supremo tribunal federal e a constitui o 20 anos
6859477 as conquistas que estiveram sob amea as ultimamente como as garantias fundamentais e o direito de defesa foram recuperadas com participa o do stf da oab do pr prio governo federal
6859478 o stf tem dado li es importantes no sentido de que importante preservar os princ pios fundamentais e que eles n o atrapalham a investiga o
6859479 o pr prio governo federal ao sancionar este m s a lei 11 767 que trata da inviolabilidade e do direito de defesa tamb m acena que s o importantes as garantias fundamentais do cidad o
6859480 a constitui o cidad que rompeu uma l gica autorit ria da ditadura militar que por si s fato para comemora o mas deve ser tamb m uma comemora o reflexiva j tivemos mais de 50 emendas que come am algumas a desfigurar o sentido da constitui o em sua origem ela era mais voltada para defender nosso patrim nio para tornar o brasil um pa s soberano e com as emendas ela ficou mais neoliberal do que pretendeu ser quando aprovada
6859481 acho que essa rea o das institui es do stf da ordem do pr prio minist rio da justi a quando opinou pela preserva o da inviolabilidade do direito de defesa demonstra que podemos compatibilizar sim o combate ao crime mas observando as regras constitucionais
6859482 the mayor has called me on several occasions yelling expletives calling me names tossing out threats i dont know what prompts a person to act in such an immature manner and it certainly makes me question his stability up to now i thought it was a major personality conflict between him and me but this attack on larry has me wondering further when the mayor called to say he would no longer support the local newspaper i felt that made a statement far beyond financial
6859483 attempts to stifle the news by anyone puts us back into the age of total governmental control it goes against everything our forefathers fought for in this country
6859484 we always attempt to give a fair and accurate account of both sides of all issues although in the past several years weve been unable to get any civil comments reflecting the city officials perspective of some incidents we report
6859485 bukan kau patut rasa pegi mampos lea mamat prepaid tu kau lebih layak pakai postpaid
6859486 boleh tak aku nak ambik kerusi and duduk depan kau the whole day aku tak percaya kau pakai kebaya hari ni

6859489 do not go where the path may lead go instead where there is no path and leave a trail
6859490 are we doing enough to make the world a better place
6859491 i believe whatever doesnt kill you simply makes you stranger
6859492 the further you run from your sins the more exhausted you are
6859493 he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life because they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste he didnt learn a thing
6859494 happiness is the highest good being a realization and perfect practice of virtue which some can attain while others have little or none of it
6859495 that man is wisest who like socrates realises that his wisdom is worthless
6859496 what do you do with an infant with pyloric stenosis
6859497 you love nick the best its perfectly obvious that nathan and i never come first
6859498 and have tried to improve the cars balance throughout the day all the time im out there im learning new things about the track
6859499 its just a matter of finding the right pieces and putting the puzzle together it has been a good day apart from one little spin and i think weve started on the right foot
6859500 some drivers just lift off the throttle and end up in your way
6859501 they are trying to create a gap ahead for the sake of a clear fast lap but they dont care who might already be on a quick lap behind them that compromises things
6859502 i am just so pleased team gb has done so well it is good for the country
6859503 when the national football team doesnt get through to a major championship as happened earlier this summer the whole nation seems down
6859504 but there is such a huge feelgood factor right now after the success of the olympics it would be great if the football team could start well in the world cup qualifiers and then we could have a british formula one world champion as well
6859505 i am working hard to fulfil my side of the bargain and watching the olympics has been an absolute inspiration when you see people who are not professionals giving everything and training as hard as they can they are just so hungry for victory and i can extract quite a lot from that
6859506 but we made a lot of mechanical and aerodynamic changes between sessions and most of them took us in the right direction the car now feels good to drive it inspires confidence its consistent and it looks after the tyres quite well
6859507 there are still some areas we can improve so things look positive it has been a good friday and we havent had many of those this year
6859508 and at one point i wasnt sure whether i was at turn 12 or turn 17 i missed the apex at the next corner as a result
6859509 its the same formula that produces the official bcs standings with two exceptions 1 since the harris interactive poll that accounts for 1 3 of the standings wont be available until late september the ap poll is used in its place 2 none of the six bcs computers publish preseason ratings so ratings from 20 computers that do are used the highest and lowest ratings for each team are discarded and the remaining 18 averaged to produce the computer score
6859510 i feel that all the good work ive done out here has gone down the pan
6859511 he caught me cold in the first round we thought hed box off the backfoot but he came out and surprised me
6859512 i dont know what happened in there i expected to go in and dominate
6859513 im so disappointed but no one can take my bronze medal away from me and it has been a fantastic journey
6859514 to try and make london 2012 as a synchro swimmer after that performance actually i just fancy a haircut and a chinese
6859515 im devastated i feel ive let the whole of sunderland down
6859516 i cannot take anything away from kenny he beat me fair and square and on the day boxed brilliantly i had a miracle performance in the quarters and i just wish i could have had another miracle performance here tonight
6859517 with three of us about to box in the semi finals
6859518 yes hes lost twice to the cuban but those fights were preparation for these olympics
6859519 james has fought four times here and each time hes just got better and better hes a bundle of fun to be around and a real class act
6859520 ive so much respect for him and if hes not around no more you wont see me fighting in london 2012
6859521 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past

6859523 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
6859524 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
6859525 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
6859526 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
6859527 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
6859528 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
6859529 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
6859530 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
6859531 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
6859532 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
6859533 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
6859534 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

6859546 i think my favorite aspect of portland is being so close to so many different landscapes forest and washington parks the columbia gorge the pacific coast mt st helens etc portland is an amazing city to live in if you want to be part of a progressive urban community while maintaining a close connection with the natural environment even within the city which is extremely accessible in size it is brilliant to be able to ride up to mt tabor for a picnic then head downtown or to a busier neighborhood to meet up with friends this city is massively versatile
6859547 i look forward to experiencing other parts of the country but have the feeling that portland will always be my home

6859557 this will make the ground water undrinkable and unsuitable for agricultural purposes the result will be food and water insecurity
6859558 the sensible option is moving to higher ground which is a tough option especially for nigeria as it means giving up its economic centres in lagos and its oil installations in the delta

6859584 people of the tuscarora joined after the original five nations were formed although frequently referred to as the iroquois the nations refer to themselves collectively as
6859585 to carry war even to their firesides in order totally to exterminate them
6859586 it would be a shame for him to allow his children to be crushed as they saw themselves to be they not having the means of going to attack their fort which was very strong nor even of defending themselves if the others came to attack them in their villages
6859587 it has been a constant maxim with the five nations to save children and young men of the people they conquer to adopt them into their own nation and to educate them as their own children without distinction these young people soon forget their own country and nation and by this policy the five nations make up the losses which their nation suffers by the people they lose in war
6859588 the voluminous records we have for the constitutional debates of the late 1780s contain no significant references to the iroquois
6859589 the iroquois probably held some sway over the thinking of the framers and the development of the u s constitution and the development of american democracy albeit perhaps indirectly or even subconsciously however the opposition is probably also correct the iroquois influence is not as great as some historians would like it to be the framers simply did not revere or even understand much of iroquois culture and their influences were european or classical not wholly new world
6859590 the national endowment for the humanities rejected a number of research proposals that dealt with the iroquois influence theory and johansens first book on the iroquois influence forgotten fathers was ordered removed from the shelves of the bookstore at hall

6859599 bevo fumo e sniffo e questa la sacrosanta verit ma se cresci in una citt come manchester o ti tieni alto il morale in questa maniera o vieni preso dalla depressione e finisci per spararti un colpo in testa
6859600 odio mio fratello e il sogno della mia vita di sfasciargli sul grugno una chitarra poi lascer che mi renda il favore proprio questo odio fraterno che trasforma gli oasis nella miglior band del mondo
6859601 veramente dovremmo aver ricevuto anche pi premi non c unaltra band nel paese che possa superarci e loro lo sanno
6859602 perch suonare su un palo della luce non potremmo suonare in uno stadio o qualcosa del genere
6859603 non venite a parlarmi dei nirvana kurt cobain era un triste idiota incapace di gestire la propria celebrit i pi forti siamo noi e potete anche andare a fanculo voi americani e i vostri fottuti pearl jam
6859604 manchester la citt pi provinciale di tutto il fottuto pianeta un sacco di nostri concittadini considerano gli oasis un gruppo di stronzi solo per il fatto che abbiamo cominciato a suonare fuori citt e perch abbiamo un batterista che originario di londra
6859605 certo che siamo dei casinisti in un certo senso per noi questa come una missione perch noi rappresentiamo la gente di manchester gente che ha fama di essere casinista e attaccabrighe non saremo noi a rinnegare questa bella tradizione
6859606 sul piano musicale il vero cervello dei beatles era paul mccartney anche se personalmente lui non mi sta per niente simpatico se lo incontrassi di sicuro lo ringrazierei per la bellezza delle sue canzoni ma poi se ci mettessimo a dialogare so che la conversazione potrebbe durare al massimo qualche manciata di secondi
6859607 io non mi preoccupo mai perch dovrei preoccuparmi si preoccupa solo chi sa di non essere bravo perch sa che quando sale potrebbero fischiarlo
6859608 ai tempi della scuola ero un gran testa di cazzo nessuna materia mi interessava odiavo leggere scrivere e studiare e poi a che serve sapere
6859609 con i lati b dei nostri singoli altri gruppi si sarebbero costruiti una carriera
6859610 si quando esco picchio sempre qualcuno cos il giorno dopo sono sul giornale
6859611 siamo ancora la miglior band del mondo almeno finch lo dir io capito
6859612 quando canto rocknroll star penso che le stars that shine siano i nostri fan
6859613 lui scrive le canzoni ma io credo di essere talentuoso e bello almeno quanto lui
6859614 non avrei problemi se si tratta di andare a bere con i blur solo che non vorrei essere al loro posto
6859615 e una canzone superba mi piace il titolo rappresenta come era quel momento quello che avevamo il titolo dice tutto da solo capisci champagne supernova per cosa cazzo sta non saprei cazzo mi ricorda solo lessere ubriachi ma con stile fottute vagonate di droga questo ci che significa champagne sta per alcohol e supernova sta per averne abusato ed essere usciti di testa
6859616 preferiamo suonare di fronte a 200 fans degli oasis piuttosto che farlo davanti a 60 000 fans del death metal
6859617 morning glory e quando ti alzi al mattino e hai un grosso rigonfiamento proprio l capito cosa intendo

6859624 non c assolutamente nulla di strano lo sanno tutti che se hai un fratello ci devi fare la guerra
6859625 non mi piace quello che stanno facendo a livello musicale ma sono bravi ne vanno pazzi e mi piacciono per questo comunque solo la stampa che continua a dire che siamo rivali

6859629 the nhl could have avoided this knowing the level of tension involved in moores hit on naslund they could have simply suspended moore for the two remaining games against vancouver that would have solved it but the league was so arrogant it thought nothing would come of the situation that let it happen now theyre in a position where it may rebound on them big time
6859630 a parte gli smiths manchester una citt che non ha prodotto mai un cazzo di buono prima degli oasis in citt cerano solo miserabili pubs e lunico vero divertimento erano le partite di calcio e ovvio che siamo tifosi del manchester city a manchester tutti sono tifosi di calcio e le tifoserie sono divise secondo gli strati sociali la classe operaia tifa per il city e i fighetti borghesi per il fottuto manchester united
6859631 senza la musica vivere non avrebbe senso la musica tutto linizio e la fine della mia vita
6859632 sono almeno 10 anni che sniffo cocaina ma non mi considero un tossicodipendente sono io che uso lei non viceversa e quando volessi potrei benissimo farne a meno
6859633 sono spesso fuori di testa perch quella la migliore sensazione del mondo una delle poche per la quale vale la pena vivere mi piace quando sono sbronzo mi stendo per terra e me ne sto l tranquillo mentre tutto mi gira intorno
6859634 la pi grande band di oggi sono gli u2 nessuno riesce a essere come loro nemmeno i fottuti guns n roses
6859635 il fatto che liam non suona non scrive testi non scrive canzoni
6859636 gli u2 scrivono grandi canzoni non importa se poi bono pensa sempre a
6859637 liam si prende tutte le ragazzine tettone e vogliose di sesso io mi becco le psicopatiche
6859638 so per certo che oggi potrei andarmi a sedere in parlamento e sostenere la conversazione con quelle mezze seghe che lo gestiscono se invece loro venissero a casa mia non saprebbero sostenere una conversazione con i miei amici potrei stare accanto alla regina e parlare con lei delle cose che conosce lei ma lei non saprebbe certo dirmi quale squadra di seconda divisione ha battuto il manchester
6859639 daccordo se hai la roba lo ho la lametta e lo specchio
6859640 so che robbie sta poco bene ma non c bisogno di mangiare tutto quel cioccolato
6859641 se vivessimo in america gli avrei gi spappolato la testa a colpa di fucile e adesso sarei qui a piangere dato che invece viviamo in inghilterra gli faccio solo un occhio nero di tanto in tanto non lo odio ma avvolte mi fa proprio perdere la pazienza
6859642 se mi avessero detto di far parte di una band con mio fratello e due regolari che non capiscono niente di calcio avrei risposto
6859643 gli americani hanno gusti del cazzo band come i backstreet boys non sanno cantare suonare e nemmeno ballare
6859644 il mio unico desiderio sempre stato fare un disco non ci vuole molto prendi una chitarra rubi un po di melodie a questo e a quello le mischi insieme chiami tuo fratello nel complesso e gli dai una botta in testa ogni tanto funziona
6859645 il bello che liam con questo berretto si sente un figo diteglielo anche voi che fa solo ridere
6859646 non sono stato messo su questa terra per ammassare soldi o guardare al mio benessere sono stato messo su questa terra per suonare la chitarra e scrivere canzoni
6859647 non lo so allinizio ero veramente bravo poi al di sopra della merda poi nella media poi appena sotto la media ora faccio schifo
6859648 a dire il vero io e mio fratello stiamo usando questa band come trampolino di lancio per un doppio ruolo di comici al david letterman show
6859649 scrivo musica per il ragazzo che cammina per strada senza troppe illusioni e si compra la copia giornaliera del daily mirror e il suo pacchetto di bensons
6859650 in fin dei conti parlando dei beatles se guardi le 100 canzoni migliori della storia 60 sono le loro
6859651 se credono che siamo degli irresponsabili fanculo io sono irresponsabile sono in un gruppo rock il mio compito proprio quello essere irresponsabile se non volessi essere irresponsabile sarei un prete del cazzo
6859652 ho 87 milioni di pounds in banca una rolls royce 3 case sto per diventare padrone del manchester city e suono nella pi grande band del mondo e tu mi chiedi se sono felice no non lo sono voglio di piu
6859653 per me lunica cosa che conta davvero la musica se fossi costretto a scegliere fra la musica e una relazione sentimentale non avrei dubbi sceglierei senzaltro la musica del resto devo dire che le mie relazioni non durano pi di qualche mese
6859654 quereler chiunque abbia detto che mi faccio una pista di cocaina ogni quaranta minuti
6859655 appena uscite da qui andate a comprare il mio cd ragazzi devo costruire un altro parcheggio per il mio elicottero
6859656 liam lidolo delle ragazze io no io sono lidolo degli idoli
6859657 le persone devono pensare a se stesse non posso pensare io per loro non mi interesso di quello che gli altri pensano di me o della band non ho un messaggio per il mondo non voglio salvare il mondo come il fottuto bob geldof mi preoccupo per mia figlia per la mia ragazza per mia mamma e per i miei fratelli degli altri non me ne frega un cazzo
6859658 fino a quando creder di avere qualcosa di valido da mettere gi in musica continuer a farlo quando sentir che non pi cos mi fermer e far qualcosaltro come aprire un ristorante fish and chips o lavorare in una macelleria
6859659 ma se tutto questo finisse domani continuerei a comporre canzoni perch questo ci che so fare lho fatto quando ero al verde e senza lavoro e fin da quando avevo 11 anni suonare la chitarra stato il mio solo modo di evadere
6859660 non voglio mettere a nudo la mia anima per me i testi rappresentano una zona grigia e non so cosa significhi ho un carattere spensierato non sono cos triste
6859661 sono circa due o tre mesi che non scrivo niente credevo fosse finita ma poi la settimana scorsa ho scritto quattro canzoni tre al numero uno e una al numero due della classifica
6859662 volete mettere via gli accendini non siete a un concerto di elton john

6859667 non si sente pi la necessit di dormire tutto falso perch sono finito dritto in uno schifosissimo ospedale
6859668 basically i noted that children only comprised about five percent of our customers but were causing like 50 percent of the problems so in order to make the other 95 percent of the customers happy i removed the children
6859669 this sends a message to our audience that if you want to avoid the noise and bother of kids that is so commonly found at showcase revere or downtown you can see your movie at our theater
6859670 what do they want them to do they cant go to the parks they cant go to the movies theyre leaving them with no options
6859671 you would think people would want something better for the kids
6859672 there just arent enough kids in the west end of the city who go to movies to make it viable
6859673 we just played kung fu panda for two weeks as a matinee and did no business on it even with a rainy weekend on the first week
6859674 i can see if they are making noise then they should kick them out
6859675 i hope that is a promise if youre going to act like that
6859676 the early evening was due to the somerville theatres policy that children under 12 are not permitted to enter the theatre past 6 p m
6859677 well that didnt work as well as we had hoped lets get flake to bring up the issue and get some more press out of it
6859678 non ha senso per noi fare calcoli contro la squadra pi esperta dobbiamo solo riproporre al meglio il nostro gioco fatto di difesa e ripartenze e prepararci mentalmente ad incontro durissimo che pu decidersi in volata
6859679 credo sia stato un calo di tensione e non atletico visto che martedi in amichevole a isola con una squadra slovena di a1 le ragazze sono sembrate scattanti e attivate

6859696 zoriah is a real photographer thank you zoriah for showing us the truth
6859697 your work is beyond words almost to point of emotional breakpoint
6859698 a riveting unflinching set of some of the most poignant photography ive ever come across

6859702 this is stunning you have a rare ability to find sensitive moments in some very insensitive situations what a talent
6859703 incredible not just because they are excellent photographs but because they are frighteningly honest i hope you continue to make these strong thought provoking records and that you stay safe in what must be incredibly difficult situations both physically and emotionally
6859704 it would be somewhat of an understatement to say i was impressed with your work we obviously know how dangerous it is to be involved in that theater iraq im sure that every moment of every day is just on the verge of chaotic for what is that war war if not the ultimate of chaos and yet you have these moments where you pause to compose image of graphic quality equal to content admire all you compositional skills but am especially taken by the wideangle work do your best to do so and know youre held in high esteem
6859705 i have to confess that i couldnt sleep properly after seeing your photos the first time these images are still in my mind and wont let me go
6859706 there is a great passion in every single shot and im very impressed sad shocked touched deeply moved frightened and inspired in the same way you are documenting a very important episode of history your pictures speak for themselves and your work is beyond words your work is not easy as it is difficult to photograph people in distress however it concerns us all and we shall not forget
6859707 into the very depths of my soul i cannot begin to even sum up with words the depths of how your images reach out to me it brings me down to earth and reminds me as to why i picked up the camera in the first place your works are truly inspiring youre very privileged to have to see these places with your own eyes observe and capture through your lens the true state of the world we live in as for now for me itll have to be through your eyes your pictures and the stories they tell truly honored
6859708 there is a hunger to know the truth about war and your accurate presentation of it is exemplary i dont believe it possible to be unmoved by your images this is especially true for those of us who live in a very different world essentially free from the suffering and carnage you portray thank you for your dedication and courage you are making and incredible contribution to world understanding hopefully not at an extreme cost to yourself war photography seems like a hard way to make a living on many levels living and breathing civilian trauma is not easy but it is more localized you can get away from it by driving or moving to another location but with war there is no escape the reality is so harsh and overwhelmingly pervasive into all areas of life stay safe many will be following you
6859709 thanks zoriah for your hard work and incredible vision and for the inspiration your example lends to others who have put down the gun or never carried one
6859710 all i can say its very very impressive keep up the good work the world must know

6859712 your images are so profound they have so much depth and feeling attached to them i have much admiration for those who are willing to risk their own safety in order to capture images such as the ones you do
6859713 after watching your pics i m absolutely tired exhausted sooooo much information inside them one day i will make pictures like yours but it will take me three or four lives to learn to do it not great but incredible work thanks for showing us all the way master
6859714 i feel honored after i have seen your great work one day maybe with more time i hope i will also be able to take the picture i like going to those place where a photographer contribute can be of a help to improve the quality of life of all those people suffering thank you again

6859796 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

6859808 this tax is actually a hardship on the company as the expenses which could otherwise be claimed as deduction from profits becomes chargeable to the fringe benefit tax the entity is also required to maintain a detailed record of these calculations and at times the compliance cost is more than the amount of revenue it generates for the government

6859844 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6859845 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6859846 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6859847 who are open to doing something on the production side
6859848 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6859849 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans

6859911 these results confirm that elesclomol powerfully and selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells by increasing the level of reactive oxygen species ros beyond sustainable levels
6859912 elevated ros levels and susceptibility to further increases in ros are fundamental characteristics of cancer cells that differentiate them from normal non cancerous cells exploiting this special vulnerability represents a novel approach to selectively targeting and killing cancer cells the findings also suggest that elesclomol can substantially enhance the efficacy of certain other anti cancer therapies when given in combination these results collectively indicate the potential of oxidative stress induction as a new therapeutic option for treating multiple types of cancers either as a single agent or in combination we are excited by the potential of this new mechanism category particularly for difficult to treat cancers such as melanoma that have not been responsive to chemotherapy or other prior approaches

6859935 if were serious about improving our schools and especially about raising up the lowest uncle sams contribution must rise to 25 or 30 percent of the total
6859936 what seems to be at play here is the resurgence of a powerful democratic imperative at the core of the american political tradition
6859937 the common presumption that schools currently provide a level playing filed paralyzes necessary efforts to invest in schools attended primarily by students of color
6859938 i know its dangerous but i want to be there
6859939 while we deeply regret the circumstances surrounding indymacs failure we believe that there is insufficient evidence for us to investigate senator schumer at this time
6859940 while senator schumers statements may have accelerated public concern about indymacs financial condition we do not believe that we can prove that they caused the banks failure
6859941 from the day schumers letter was made public on june 26 until the closure of the bank a run on the bank took place and the failure became inevitable
6859942 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6859943 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6859944 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6859945 cannot imagine that many americans would not consider it a privilege
6859946 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those questions
6859947 were trending towards a lot of oil price volatility on the direction of the dollar
6859948 there are huge amounts of money involved and the large moves have been based primarily on dollar strength
6859949 fewer trucks delivering packages fewer people going to work theres a very strong correlation between gdp growth and oil usage
6859950 there was the potential for some type of action across the georgian border and we just havent seen anything

6859955 cannot imagine that many americans would not consider it a privilege
6859956 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6859957 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6859958 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6859959 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6859960 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6859961 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6859962 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6859963 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6859964 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6859965 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6859966 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6859967 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6859968 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6859969 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6859970 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6859971 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6859972 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6859973 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6859974 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6859975 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6859976 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6859977 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6859978 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6859979 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6859980 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6859981 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6859982 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6859983 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6859984 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6859985 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6859986 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6859987 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6859988 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6859989 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6859990 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6859991 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6859992 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6859993 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6859994 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6859995 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6859996 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6859997 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6859998 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6859999 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
