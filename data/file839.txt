8390000 this emotional connection led people to begin posting content online on their myspace and facebook pages and on their own blogs
8390001 the most important thing a retail blogger should have is an intrinsic understanding of why your customers value what you sell
8390002 these have to be people who do not see it as a chore but instead as a fun thing to do thats personal to them on something theyre passionate about
8390003 you would be able to see it on the blog if it came through as drudgery
8390004 if someone felt it was only part of their job requirements and didnt have enthusiasm for it the tone would come through
8390005 we actually talk to the readers instead of treating them like customers
8390006 we tell stories theres usually a product tie in like a fitness watch but because its a real person telling their own story its not advertising speak its coming from someone people can relate to
8390007 she had the most ratty beat up pair of vans she said she had them for 10 years and told me this long story about what they meant to her
8390008 then i found out she was an artist and she filled me in on some of the things she was working on so i had a great story that was a glimpse into the life of an artist and how she has grown up with her one pair of shoes
8390009 when you look at the rise of things like reality tv and social networks
8390010 you easily see that people like to hear stories about other people
8390011 we have an unspoken rule the blog is not for pimping products its about educating entertaining and engaging pet parents our customers
8390012 when we identify there is a need increased awareness about allergies with certain foods what can i do to stop my pets chewing or behavioral issues we do a blog post about the issue and mention some available solutions but the selling is not the gist of our posts
8390013 you have to write from a users perspective not a sellers perspective
8390014 for the fitness watch i wrote about how i used it in training and how it helps me reach my personal goals as opposed to rattling off the same features you would see in advertising copy
8390015 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8390016 i was pushed to the limit the last time i played her she was up 5 1 in third and i had to come back
8390017 the most important thing is to stay positive in the difficult moments in the match and be able to win even when you feel tired
8390018 hopefully i can play even better in the next round
8390019 after it happened i was thinking more of it than i was the pain so it is not really a big deal
8390020 but in a certain moment i felt big pain so i had to get it taped
8390021 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aide using battleships
8390022 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states
8390023 its strange that our actions to defend our citizens right on our borders should be criticised by britain considering its actions in the falkland islands which are the other side of the world
8390024 china is concerned about the latest development in south ossetia and abkhazia
8390025 i handed in a formal call to recognise the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia
8390026 which aims to unilaterally change the borders of georgia is quite simply unacceptable
8390027 over time the subscriber growth will be much more a function of cable and international distribution deals
8390028 weve had a real focus on trying to drive our subscriber acquisition cost numbers down a lot of that is being able to develop better opportunities for third parties to market us
8390029 sweetie i love you your dick is gorgeous and you know how to cut into the corners when we paint rooms but the non showering thing kinda skeeves me out
8390030 if you take a shower every other day i will soap your genitals personally
8390031 if wednesday is open day for the mayor he should be down here this is ridiculous
8390032 my son was shot this monday and no one called me or anything
8390033 were going to face a confident bunch very experienced and a team that will be pretty eager to win it on their own turf but this is what its all about
8390034 i dont think players back east have a lot of knowledge or respect for this team
8390035 but i want to face the best team and this is the team that can answer the bell
8390036 our young guys have really helped carry our club forward the last couple of years at both ends of the floor
8390037 they have played hard and unselfish led by our veterans they really pride themselves on being an old school team
8390038 everyone pushes the next guy while still building a strong team atmosphere their mindset is simple play hard and enjoy the opportunity we have been given
8390039 our plans are to play hard and have fun worrying about where or who we are playing wont help us
8390040 there really isnt a lot of pressure on a team that no one expects to win
8390041 if ryan trades dawson for any combination of players or draft picks he is out of his mind
8390042 the loss of this valuable and irreplaceable painting has saddened the entire community and we still hope it will be found

8390050 odds of treasury stepping in and dealing with fannie mae and freddie mac before the end of this year have been considerably diminished
8390051 its a little of a race between the profits on the portfolios and the losses they are taking on defaults and mark to market write downs
8390052 at the same time data is looking like the housing market is near a bottom
8390053 still it will become increasingly difficult for policy makers to ignore the gse situation as risks of further contraction in the mortgage market are as unpalatable as a high profile bailout
8390054 and even if funding levels are getting cheaper theres a good chance their assets being funded are also getting cheaper and what we care about is potential profitability
8390055 hundreds of thousands for children are going to school this fall without protection from deadly diseases
8390056 at some point were going to be forced to decide whether it is an inalienable right to catch and transmit potentially fatal infections
8390057 put the signs down for now well tell you when to put them up
8390058 i believe from the bottom of my heart with the right vision the right leadership and the energy and creativity of the american people there is no nation that we cant out hustle or out compete and no american need be left out or left behind
8390059 we have a press bottleneck between alaska and new york they wont move
8390060 you know america has never been afraid of the future and we shouldnt start now
8390061 you can drop your bags at my place were staying at the sheraton
8390062 barack obama has a different vision and a different plan the status quo just wont cut it
8390063 guys you cant stand there youve got to keep moving move move move
8390064 a lot of people struggle with it but it shouldnt be a struggle
8390065 most people dont say im mixed race but im this race and that race
8390066 how real is race a sourcebook on race culture and biology
8390067 none of this makes sense from a biological point of view
8390068 race has everything to do with culture and socially constructed borderlines
8390069 this is the opportunity for the millions of gospel christian music fans to have their own national month to honor and celebrate the rich heritage of their music
8390070 any references to saudis and terrorist s in the book
8390071 could potentially create libel lawsuits as it could offend saudis living in england and this has happened with many other u s publications and we do not want to be jeopardized in selling this book
8390072 munson is so expensive now it would be fine to do so as none of the others are anywhere close to the same value
8390073 authentic mickey mantle memorabilia card featuring a piece of mantles off the field clothing
8390074 i can assure you we take all precautions all rules of engagement are followed we have tremendous confidence and faith in our leadership here in afghanistan
8390075 the enemy which is trying to do things to make a propaganda campaign out of such incidents so nobody benefits
8390076 definitely we ourselves and the international community will exercise maximum caution to prevent such incidents which go against all of our wishes and all of the ideals which we are here fighting for
8390077 prevent the repetition of such incidents which are so unfortunate
8390078 having these eyes in the sky that allow us to locate the taliban to see in some instances where they are making these ieds improvised explosive devices that are having such a horrific effect on the troops and the civilian population
8390079 there is no question that this has been a tough season very difficult sledding for our forces as well as our allies
8390080 my old government teacher will probably flip when he hears im going to the white house
8390081 its the oval office the lincoln bedroom the cabinet room the presidents personal sleeping quarters think of all the decisions that have been made in these places over the years
8390082 but on the tour day were going to take a group photo on the roof its going to be pretty incredible
8390083 it was my little contribution to help with the nations budget deficit
8390084 when you stand on the roof of the white house you think my god how does this happen to a guy who works on chimneys but thats whats great about this country anything is possible its just a matter of finding a way to do it and following up on it
8390085 he could probably tell from my application that i was on my knees begging it was pretty pathetic
8390086 i think the guy asked me how many jobs i had done and i was like yours and one more will be two
8390087 im afraid those numbers may more accurately reflect whats happening with the vaccination of young children said dr
8390088 its unlikely that many will catch up before they enter school and with exemptions so easily granted they dont have to
8390089 weve already dropped below the level of vaccine coverage where herd immunity exists for some diseases at some point were going to be forced to decide whether it is an inalienable right to catch and transmit potentially fatal infections
8390090 measles is imported into this country all the time but this year weve seen it spread to much larger groups of unvaccinated people as many as 30 in one group of home schooled children in illinois than weve had in recent years
8390091 most first line vaccines are about 85 to 95 percent effective so even those who have done the right thing by getting vaccinated on time have a 10 to 20 percent chance theyre still unprotected omer said
8390092 so if im one of those people what are the consequences of people around me not doing the right thing it puts me in a great deal of danger
8390093 we took him to our local emergency room and they were treating him like it was an asthma attack but this one young doctor asked me if hed been vaccinated i said no and within seconds he realized how life threatening matthews condition really was he saved his life
8390094 i didnt think twice about shots but then we started hearing about the autism concerns and it seemed like i was surrounded by friends with children getting diagnosed with those conditions
8390095 i saw so many cards come through stating the mother wanted a religious exemption from vaccination
8390096 baby shots but when lacek asked her pediatrician if she could prove to her there was no mercury in the vaccines
8390097 i think making people aware of real life stories like ours letting them know that these killer diseases vaccines are meant to prevent are still out there helps put the risks in a different light lacek said
8390098 i still have friends that dont immunize and i understand their reasons but you need to balance those fears with social responsibility enderlein said
8390099 i worry at some point were going to hit some critical mass of unvaccinated kids and see an epidemic thats a lot more compelling than the possibility of adverse reactions to vaccines
8390100 one size fits all vaccine policy imposed by government health agencies
8390101 weve seen a doubling of the number of vaccines and doses that the government recommends to stay healthy before age 6 while at the same time weve seen a tripling of the number of children with learning disabilities asthma diabetes and other conditions
8390102 the only way to put the question to rest is to do the proper science
8390103 no one is saying this is necessarily all due to the increase in vaccines but vaccines shouldnt be left off the table when no one has come up with an answer fisher said
8390104 parents simply have to be educated and put in the best position to consider the risks and benefits of vaccines and the various diseases
8390105 and i think government and industry need to spend more be more proactive on vaccine safety research
8390106 on the front lines no provider should be dismissive of parents with concerns about vaccines you should listen and try to address them not kick them out of your practice he added
8390107 the safety movement was largely launched by middle class moms who had the education and time to analyze the medical literature but now were in a third generation of parents dealing with these issues and its a more diverse group with a much broader reach because of the internet they can see that adverse reaction reports are similar around the world
8390108 the public health infrastructure of this country the cdc and the vaccine industry operate on the ideology that some adverse reactions to vaccines are acceptable to serve the greater public good but how many is too many 5 5000 or 5 million its a slippery ethical slope
8390109 more excitement to the idea of using reprogramming as a way to treat diabetes
8390110 i wake up every day thinking about how to make beta cells
8390111 this current election is more about personalities than issues and you have mr change to thank for that
8390112 im the first viable black candidate so you should vote for me
8390113 im the first viable female candidate so you should vote for me
8390114 im the first viable female candidate so you should vote for me
8390115 you have to ask if a female candidate had been the victim of rape and she brought that up would people mock that in the same way
8390116 iran and venezuela are no big threat to us because they are tiny countries
8390117 s gente la newsletter aspira a diventare un settimanale nazionale uscire in tutte le edicole dello stivale anche quella sotto casa vostra e per farlo ha bisogno di voi
8390118 do you want that opportunity or do you want the greater things that i have for you

8390121 the two hijackers were transported to one of the halls at kufrah airport after giving themselves up
8390122 we can confirm that all the plane passengers have been freeed by the hijackers
8390123 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8390124 i want you to know that this has been a joy yes we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time
8390125 if she can get up there and put everything aside and say shes supporting barack obama with her whole heart then its up to us to do the same thing
8390126 i dont see any further reason to continue to carry out a pretense that shes a candidate shes not
8390127 if we dont have an official roll call vote state by state it is going to reopen a wound
8390128 i think it is reflective of the unity that i sense that is building across the party
8390129 that doesnt mean there wont be outliers that are still heartbroken their favorite candidate didnt make it
8390130 going to be able to bring themselves to vote for anybody other than senator clinton
8390131 even though hillary tells us not to spend any time thinking about what might have been
8390132 im sure all of us were thinking about what might have been last night
8390133 if shes not a strong enough leader to get her followers to do whats right for america then that would surprise me
8390134 i think they are going to follow her lead and her lead was very crystal clear last night
8390135 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8390136 im comfortable with my conditioning and my overall health im ready for the start of camp and am looking forward to the upcoming season
8390137 everybody was starting to worry what joe was going to do
8390138 its great news for more than one reason what he brings to the ice everyone knows joe is joe but what he brings to the locker room the respect everybodys so calm when hes around thats what he brings that people dont see
8390139 hes done everything for this organization they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8390140 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in
8390141 if you insist on a quick answer youre probably going to get the answer you dont want if you insist on an answer now it might be no if you give me more time it might be yes
8390142 teams asked if they could at least submit an offer for consideration and joe told me to advise teams not to bother
8390143 hes one of our main guys but we dont think its a season ending injury
8390144 the time frame it fluctuates but hopefully with his youth and hes been pretty durable and resilient to injury hopefully he does get back soon
8390145 with the offseason moves we made hopefully we can still play at a high level this year to me its more something that you look at as a challenge and you dont let it defeat you you deal with it
8390146 training camp was going to be an important part of his development
8390147 thats going to be postponed obviously but hes got a lot of development on and off the court that hes going to continue to do ive got a lot of confidence in him and now his job is to get healthy
8390148 just in talking to nellie today were talking about maybe spreading that ball around and getting scoring from different areas
8390149 marcus is more of a pass first point guard if at some point he thought he didnt get a chance in new jersey hes going to get a chance now
8390150 we cant arrange long term care here so we try to do the best we can in the country of origin
8390151 the question is is the hospital acting as an immigration agent in effect by deporting this patient
8390152 its important to make sure that hospitals arent permitted to dump patients on an international level when they cant do it on a local level
8390153 hospitals dont have the financial resources to meet all of the acute care needs of patients without insurance let alone take on all the chronic care needs that present with patients like this
8390154 there were certain legal procedures that the hospital should have followed that they bypassed
8390155 we have worked with the individual who has had primary decision making responsibility for the patient
8390156 i am very pro eating and i am really a jewish mother at heart if you ask anyone in my personal life im a food pusher i dont let people leave my house without eating or taking a goodie bag i am very in support of healthy women and healthy bodies
8390157 i am who i am if people like that or dont like that its up to them to decide

8390162 but one thing that i know theres no tomorrow theyre burying me
8390163 i may need a little help sometimes just to get around and i cant tell when the sun goes down but i fall in love like you do and thats a fact but it makes me no difference if youre white or black i can see so much deeper than skin what you see without i can see within so what a wonderful world this would be if we could see what the blind man sees
8390164 everything is going up up and up and the dollar is going down down and down the cost of dime has got cheaper cause living has gone clean out of sight people aint get no raises and you know damn well that aint right people say hannibal you gottta cut down on your eatin but i cant cut down no more so im talking to all you fellas on the hill and the congress do something responsible like show me the money

8390167 on august 29 2005 hurricane katrina took nearly everything from us our home our belongings and our memories when we returned to our mississippi home for the first time fearing everything lost we were amazed to find our brass beds of virginia headboard and footboard waiting for us in the mud where our home used to be to be excited at a moment as tragic as this is hard to explain but this was no ordinary bed to us from the photo youll understand why we were so shocked to find all the metal parts of our bed undamaged the bed was so well made and heavy it didnt float away with the rest of the house katrina left us with very little to call our own this bed will always remind us of our survival and recovery it is truly an heirloom one day when our grandchildren and great grandchildren snuggle up with us we will tell them the amazing story of our very special bed
8390168 the fat cells we found in our obese patients were deficient in several areas
8390169 they showed significant stress on the endoplasmic reticulum and the tissue itself was more inflamed than in our lean patients
8390170 its really a rare opportunity that students can in this sort of classroom setting have a conversation with the president of the university
8390171 im taking her to a football game in honor of our anniversary

8390186 we dont want to lose hold of this wealth that is 6 000 metres deep
8390187 it is the wealth of the country it is the wealth of 190 million brazilians and we have to use this wealth to help the poor of the country
8390188 to resolve definitively the problem of education in this country to resolve the problems of millions of poor that are here and not leave it in the hands of half a dozen companies that think the petrol belongs to them
8390189 i think the government has two views about creating a new company
8390190 one of these is to have large control of the oil production and this a nationalist view to keep control of the oil production the other concern is about getting most of the profit from the oil
8390191 and this is before tupi for sure tupi and the pre salt area will increase those numbers mostly after 2013 but for sure we are going to get a bigger number than that
8390192 i think brazil will still carry on its programme of ethanol because ethanol is still cheaper than gasoline and so i dont think there is a contradiction
8390193 brazil will probably become a large exporter of oil products and keep developing bio fuels and bio energy because it is a very large resource in the country
8390194 brazil does not think that ethanol is a solution for the whole world in energy terms it only plays a small part
8390195 it is impossible to supply all the fuel used in the world from bio energy but it can play a very important role and is very important for developing countries that need new sources of revenue
8390196 i think brazil should take care not to have oil as the only financial resource and to also use this money to develop other industries
8390197 being an attractive white male is no longer enough to make you the president
8390198 anybody who could be persuaded would be persuaded by that speech she nailed it

8390201 ive been in small private universities for the last seven years and im anxious to get back to a large public university
8390202 bring them on board to realize whats there for them and how it can benefit them
8390203 very friendly he has a very warm personality you get that feeling immediately when you meet him hes a solid professional with good credentials he will bring added depth to the institution
8390204 we certainly will not be expecting to have very significant write downs like the ones this year
8390205 this years schedule features a good mix of non conference teams that we will be competitive with along with horizon league teams that will challenge us this season as we continue to rebuild the program
8390206 this facility change to the new 10 lane 50 meter x 25 yard natatorium at fishers high school is a good move for butler swimming

8390263 i think the blues is a source for hope and healing and a way to express feelings that come from your very core
8390264 i wasnt born poor in the cotton fields but i still fill my music with who i am not all blues artists are american black men and im proud to represent another side thats just as real
8390265 in serbia we lived in constant fear because of the deception from both the government and the media that they controlled so my music is a mix of the personal and political and the blues have a way of personalizing the political i do love to talk blues with my dad when i visit my parents back home i hope i never forget where i came from particularly live i try to recapture that youthful energy and wonder i still enjoy reaching back to play the first elmore james solo i ever learned
8390266 i think you really need to be thoroughly schooled in the roots of whatever music youre playing
8390267 i like to play the old school stuff and remember what it was that drew me to this music in the first place i keep my arrangements fairly simple so we wont get lost in the studios technical gadgetry that can overproduce the music

8390280 hes probably the most articulate critic of redevelopment in the nation and hes in your backyard
8390281 youre using taxpayer money that is intended for great public purposes using that money to fund private development and that development not only doesnt alleviate blight it is its cause
8390282 when they bulldozed the pike and rebuilt that whole area with chain restaurants they sucked the soul out of pine avenue
8390283 for a city that supposedly values homeownership and community and neighborhood businesses i think redevelopment has really worked against it
8390284 we have empty lots now with white ranch fences where we used to have maybe substandard commercial entities but they were still contributing to the tax base there were communities and homes there before its like throwing the baby out with the bathwater
8390285 but now they cant stop themselves on account of all the cash coming in
8390286 anything that would shift local resources out of this community is something that neither the agency nor the city would support

8390294 there are many ways to go home my clients tell me these mundane endeavors constitute a return to home for them rereading passages of books and single poems that have touched them spending even a few minutes near a river a stream a creek lying on the ground in dappled light praying a special friend sitting on a bridge with legs dangling over holding an infant sitting by a window in a cafe and writing sitting in a circle of trees beholding beauty grace the touching frailty of human beings
8390295 it is preferable to go home for a while even if it causes others to be irritated rather than to stay and deteriorate and then finally crawl away in tatters
8390296 it is right and proper that women eke out liberate take make connive to get assert their right to go home home is a sustained mood or sense that allows us to experience feelings not necessarily sustained in the mundane world wonder vision peace freedom from worry freedom from demands freedom from constant clacking all these treasures from home are meant to be cached in the psyche for later use in the topside world
8390297 it is better to teach your people that you will be more and also different when you return that you are not abandoning them but learning yourself anew and bringing yourself back to your real life

8390307 this is what you get when you have republicans governing you horribly incompetent and ineffective government see katrina fiscal irresponsibility unbalanced budgets ballooning deficits the price of everything skyrocketing and the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs contrast that with bill clintons term in office economic prosperity balanced budgets competent and effective government see femas response to all the natural disasters and the right wing terrorist attack at oklahoma city creation of millions of new jobs and a fair tax burden across the board oh yes and clinton actually stopped a terrorist attack planned by al queda for the millenium whereas bush allowed one to happen whether through negligence incompetence or malfeasance the choice cannot be clearer and it is time to just face the facts you republicans just suck at everything you do it is the reverse midas touch

8390313 what you see now is journalists who are grateful for news which is almost perfectly packaged to go into the paper with a ready top line in that sense journalism is becoming very passive it is a processor of other peoples information rather than being engaged in actively seeking out and determining what the truth of a situation is in an energetic and inquisitive way
8390314 what weve tried to do since 2004 is understand how the media works so weve tried to give news stories to journalists on a plate journalists have 101 things to do in their day and dont often have time to read long and dry reports from think thanks so we use the freedom of information act and a team of researchers to get fresh figures from government and local councils which we package up into brief media friendly research papers complete with eye catching headline figures to give reporters a ready made top line

8390368 there is almost consensus among scholars that a woman in her period is allowed to touch or carry or use books on islam or works of tafsir quran exegesis that may contain verses of the quran the only difference of opinion among authentic scholars is about touching or carrying or reading from the entire quran itself although most scholars consider it haram unlawful for a woman to touch or carry the full quran many scholars have determined it permissible for those who are teachers or students to repeat there is absolutely nothing wrong with a woman who is studying islam to carry or read or touch books or works of tafsir which contain verses of the quran during menstruation
8390369 the menstruating woman and the one who is in a state of impurity janaabah should not recite anything of the quraan
8390370 there is no clear saheeh text to indicate that a menstruating woman is forbidden to recite quraan it is known that women used to menstruate at the time of the messenger of allaah peace and blessings of allaah be upon him and he did not forbid them to recite quraan or to remember allaah dhikr and offer duaa

8390444 we would like to see something in the new architecture policy about the need for architecture to respect a locality
8390445 we may not have architectural knowledge but we all understand the loss of what makes a place special the everyday is disappearing fast said this attendee
8390446 we need to preserve buildings but also be creative with their new use
8390447 for most people the word architecture does not enter their vocabulary
8390448 do we need architecture in our schools or do we need good school architecture
8390449 architects planners and engineers to work together to achieve better quality in our infrastructure
8390450 the structures in local authorities have to change to allow more collaboration
8390451 an essential and vital opportunity to listen to the public who are the users and developers of the built environment
8390452 the irish architecture foundation was established as a direct result of the last architectural policy as action on architecture 2002 2005 had recommended the setting up of a virtual architecture centre
8390453 architecture is everyday life it affects us all and we all need to be able to share in it

8390478 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware

8390480 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8390481 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8390482 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8390483 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8390484 it is still amazing to me how much press this has generated for us
8390485 if its been mentioned on the office people want to come and see it
8390486 we couldnt be happier they picked scranton and not utica
8390487 when the city started to decline and the coal industry moved out we suffered
8390488 the streets were a mess the sidewalks were falling into the ground it wasnt the prettiest thing
8390489 people make choices on where they want to live and businesses make choices about where they want to be identified with
8390490 should come to scranton and walk the rope line and let people see him its politics 101 you gotta knock on a lot of doors
8390491 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8390492 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8390493 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8390494 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8390495 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8390496 because seat belts can reduce the risk of injury and death in crashes by more than 50 there is a critical need for interventions to increase seat belt use by teens as both drivers and passengers
8390497 this research reinforces why state farm is actively involved in advocating for laws that help prevent injuries and deaths resulting from motor vehicle crashes its clear from these findings that primary seat belt laws for all occupants would help us accomplish that goal
8390498 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
8390499 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8390500 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8390501 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
8390502 this indicates that people remain stable in their verbal abilities unless they are experiencing disease processes that also increase their mortality risk
8390503 a change in verbal ability might therefore be considered a critical marker for degeneration in health in older people
8390504 the fat cells we found in our obese patients were deficient in several areas
8390505 they showed significant stress on the endoplasmic reticulum and the tissue itself was more inflamed than in our lean patients
8390506 i am so glad this is over justice has been served
8390507 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8390508 im not going to make prognostications about legislative strategies on this or any other issue
8390509 to describe iran as a tiny country that doesnt pose any threat
8390510 they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
8390511 and yet we were willing to talk to the soviet union at the time when they were saying were going to wipe you off the planet
8390512 when sen mccain does it it becomes a major issue in the press

8390584 every funder that we talked to was very concerned that the threat of closure represents an attack on the ability of a productive academic unit to do its work without interference
8390585 when a clampdown on academic freedom appears imminent of course we have to drop our project work and mount a strong defence
8390586 that in turn sends signals of insecurity to funders which in turn require a very strong motion of confidence luckily that came last week in the faculty boards vote to retain ccs by 33 1
8390587 it can be a byzantine maze working through the university
8390588 we dont know which way management will be going or if we are on a safe track but we as ccs are planning to intensify and expand our work
8390589 the threat of closure of ccs has done community groups a huge disservice already

8390593 from march onwards the university administration has failed to respond to a february ukzn review recommendation that we be given many more honorary researcher positions
8390594 we were also hoping to acquire a formal accreditation that would draw them into our formal research programme that was also stalled unnecessarily
8390595 we were informed on july 30 that contracts of all staff except mine would be terminated

8390646 trust in the living god who is the saviour of all men
8390647 every word of god is pure he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him
8390648 as for god his way is perfect the word of the lord is tried he is a buckler to all them that trust in him
8390649 how excellent is thy lovingkindness o god therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings

8390652 woe to them that go down to egypt for help and stay on horses and trust in chariots because they are many and in horsemen because they are very strong but they look not unto the holy one of israel neither seek the lord
8390653 thus saith the lord cursed be the man that trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arm and whose heart departeth from the lord for he shall be like the heath in the desert and shall not see when good cometh but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness in a salt land and not inhabited blessed is the man that trusteth in the lord and whose hope the lord is

8390658 you shall not take the name of the lord your god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain
8390659 remember the sabbath day to keep it holy six days you shall labor and do all your work but the seventh day is a sabbath to the lord your god in it you shall not do any work you or your son or your daughter your manservant or your maidservant or your cattle or the sojourner who is within your gates for in six days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that is in them and rested the seventh day therefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it

8390671 being then gods offspring we ought not to think that the deity is like gold or silver or stone a representation by the art and imagination of man the times of ignorance god overlooked but now he commands all men everywhere to repent because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed and of this he has given assurance to all men by raising him from the dead
8390672 you shall not take the name of the lord your god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain
8390673 they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called
8390674 study to show thyself approved unto god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness
8390675 this people honors me with their lips but their heart is far from me in vain do they worship me teaching as doctrines the precepts of men you leave the commandment of god and hold fast the tradition of men
8390676 not every one who says to me lord lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he who does the will of my father who is in heaven
8390677 on that day many will say to me lord lord did we not prophesy in your name and cast out demons in your name and do many mighty works in your name and then will i declare to them i never knew you depart from me you evildoers
8390678 every one then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house upon the rock and the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house but it did not fall because it had been founded on the rock and every one who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand and the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house and it fell and great was the fall of it
8390679 remember the sabbath day to keep it holy six days you shall labor and do all your work but the seventh day is a sabbath to the lord your god in it you shall not do any work you or your son or your daughter your manservant or your maidservant or your cattle or the sojourner who is within your gates for in six days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that is in them and rested the seventh day therefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it
8390680 thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them and on the seventh day god finished his work which he had done and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done so god blessed the seventh day and hallowed it because on it god rested from all his work which he had done in creation
8390681 if you turn back your foot from the sabbath from doing your pleasure on my holy day and call the sabbath a delight and the holy day of the lord honorable if you honor it not going your own ways see i did it my way or seeking your own pleasure or talking idly then you shall take delight in the lord and i will make you ride upon the heights of the earth i will feed you with the heritage of jacob your father for the mouth of the lord has spoken
8390682 i gave them my statutes and showed them my ordinances by whose observance man shall live moreover i gave them my sabbaths as a sign between me and them that they might know that i the lord sanctify them
8390683 and on the sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue and many who heard him were astonished saying
8390684 as they went out the people begged that these things might be told them the next sabbath and when the meeting of the synagogue broke up many jews and devout converts to judaism followed paul and barnabas who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of god the next sabbath almost the whole city gathered together to hear the word of god
8390685 for as the new heavens and the new earth which i will make shall remain before me says the lord so shall your descendants and your name remain from new moon to new moon and from sabbath to sabbath all flesh shall come to worship before me says the lord
8390686 honor your father and your mother that your days may be long in the land which the lord your god gives you
8390687 if a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother and though they chastise him will not give heed to them then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city at the gate of the place where he lives and they shall say to the elders of his city this our son is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey our voice he is a glutton and a drunkard then all the men of the city shall stone him to death with stones so you shall purge the evil from your midst
8390688 whoever strikes his father or his mother shall be put to death whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death
8390689 children obey your parents in the lord for this is right honor your father and mother
8390690 the soul that sins shall die the son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself
8390691 standing by the cross of jesus were his mother and his mothers sister mary the wife of clopas and mary magdalene
8390692 our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name
8390693 my little children with whom i am again in travail until christ be formed in you the jerusalem above is free and she is our
8390694 thus says the lord god of israel put every man his sword on his side and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp and slay every man his brother and every man his companion and every man his neighbor
8390695 thus says the lord of hosts i will punish what amalek did to israel in opposing them on the way when they came up out of egypt now go and smite amalek and utterly destroy all that they have do not spare them but kill both man and woman infant and suckling
8390696 whoever strikes a man so that he dies shall be put to death but if he did not lie in wait for him but god let him fall into his hand then i will appoint for you a place to which he may flee but if a man willfully attacks another to kill him treacherously you shall take him from my altar that he may die whoever strikes his father or his mother shall be put to death whoever steals a man whether he sells him or is found in possession of him shall be put to death whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death
8390697 any one who hates his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him
8390698 but as for the cowardly the faithless the polluted as for murderers fornicators sorcerers idolaters and all liars their lot shall be in the lake that burns with fire and sulphur which is the second death
8390699 if a man commits adultery with the wife of his neighbor both the adulterer and the adulteress shall be put to death
8390700 he who commits adultery has no sense he who does it destroys himself
8390701 for they have committed adultery and blood is upon their hands with their idols they have committed adultery
8390702 if you were abrahams children you would do what abraham did but now you seek to kill me a man who has told you the truth which i heard from god this is not what abraham did you do what your father did
8390703 we were not born of fornication we have one father even god
8390704 if god were your father you would love me for i proceeded and came forth from god i came not of my own accord but he sent me why do you not understand what i say it is because you cannot bear to hear my word you are of your father the devil and your will is to do your fathers desires
8390705 it is for discipline that you have to endure god is treating you as sons for what son is there whom his father does not discipline if you are left without discipline in which all have participated then you are illegitimate children and not sons besides this we have had earthly fathers to discipline us and we respected them shall we not much more be subject to the father of spirits and live
8390706 and he carried me away in the spirit into a wilderness and i saw a woman i e in this case an apostate church sitting on a scarlet beast i e a great political system which was full of blasphemous names see
8390707 babylon the great mother of harlots and of earths abominations
8390708 he who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much and he who is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much if then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon who will entrust to you the true riches and if you have not been faithful in that which is anothers who will give you that which is your own no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other you cannot serve god and mammon
8390709 and jesus entered the temple of god and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons
8390710 it is written my house shall be called a house of prayer but you make it a den of robbers
8390711 will man rob god yet you are robbing me but you say how are we robbing thee in your tithes and offerings you are cursed with a curse for you are robbing me the whole nation of you bring the full tithes into the storehouse that there may be food in my house and thereby put me to the test says the lord of hosts if i will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you an overflowing blessing
8390712 do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of god do not be deceived neither the immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor sexual perverts nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor revilers nor robbers will inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you but you were washed you were sanctified you were justified in the name of the lord jesus christ and in the spirit of our god
8390713 let the thief no longer steal but rather let him labor doing honest work with his hands so that he may be able to give to those in need
8390714 why do you not understand what i say it is because you cannot bear to hear my word you are of your father the devil and your will is to do your fathers desires he was a murderer from the beginning and has nothing to do with the truth because there is no truth in him when he lies he speaks according to his own nature for he is a liar and the father of lies but because i tell the truth you do not believe me
8390715 the god of this world see has blinded the minds of the unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is the likeness of god
8390716 put off your old nature which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your minds and put on the new nature created after the likeness of god in true righteousness and holiness therefore putting away falsehood let every one speak the truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another
8390717 we have renounced disgraceful underhanded ways we refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with gods word but by the open statement of the truth we would commend ourselves to every mans conscience in the sight of god
8390718 but you yourselves wrong and defraud and that even your own brethren do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of god do not be deceived neither the immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor sexual perverts nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor revilers nor robbers will inherit the kingdom of god
8390719 behold i am coming soon bringing my recompense to repay every one for what he has done i am the alpha and the omega the first and the last the beginning and the end
8390720 the heavens will pass away with a loud noise and the elements will be dissolved with fire and the earth and the works that are upon it will be burned up since all these things are thus to be dissolved what sort of persons ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of god because of which the heavens will be kindled and dissolved and the elements will melt with fire but according to his promise we wait for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells therefore beloved since you wait for these be zealous to be found by him without spot or blemish and at peace
8390721 you shall not covet your neighbors house you shall not covet your neighbors wife or his manservant or his maidservant or his ox or his ass or anything that is your neighbors
8390722 what shall we say then is the law sin god forbid nay i had not known sin but by the law for i had not known lust except the law had said thou shalt not covet
8390723 for this thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
8390724 but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out and having food and raiment let us be therewith content but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows
8390725 and he said unto them take heed and beware of covetousness for a mans life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth and he spake a parable unto them saying the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully and he thought within himself saying what shall i do because i have no room where to bestow my fruits and he said this will i do i will pull down my barns and build greater and there will i bestow all my fruits and my goods and i will say to my soul soul thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be merry but god said unto him thou fool this night thy soul shall be required of thee then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided so is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich toward god
8390726 cases like that of chinh are not rare in society today

8390795 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8390796 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8390797 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8390798 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8390799 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8390800 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8390801 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8390802 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8390803 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8390804 at the pirates request the office of the commissioner today placed pedro alvarez on major league baseballs restricted list
8390805 the major league rules provide that a player who refuses to sign a uniform player contract to which he has agreed and report to the signing club shall upon a report of the signing club be placed on the restricted list until he signs a contract reflecting the terms to which he has agreed
8390806 the pirates are confident that the contract reached with pedro alvarez was agreed to and submitted to major league baseball in a timely fashion and properly accepted by major league baseball
8390807 the pirates made several attempts to commence negotiations immediately following the draft and were willing and ready to agree to pay pedro a 6 million signing bonus from the very outset
8390808 the office of the commissioner has assured us that we have a valid contract with pedro and that it will vigorously defend any claim to the contrary despite our disappointment we continue to believe in pedro alvarez the person and the baseball player and remain excited to add pedro to our system we will sit down with pedro and his family as soon as mr boras claim is rejected to chart a new and much more productive start to pedros career with the pittsburgh pirates
8390809 i dont think hosmers deal would get nixed without a formal claim being made
8390810 2 the pirates cannot void his contract now because of injury what kind of terrible organization would not require an extensive physical before agreeing to a contract
8390811 you are wrong alvarez verbally agreed to a minor league contract a minor league contract is subject to a physical even after the contract is signed a major league contract can not be rescinded because of an injury so a team really needs a physical before signing a draftee to a major league contract
8390812 no 2 draft pick pedro alvarez refused to sign his contract with the pittsburgh pirates and the players association filed a grievance wednesday
8390813 wait that wasnt agreed upon before the deadline go independent or re enter next year mr harrington er oops alvarez
8390814 the nats are happy because they no longer look like the biggest idiots from this years draft
8390815 theres a reason boras has a reputation as a d chebag its well earned i hate a rod but big ups to him for leaving borass out of the negotiations hes part of whats wrong w baseball mlbpa has too much power
8390816 but you still want to keep monitoring this to see if this goes away or persists
8390817 these three trials do not provide any credible evidence of any side effect
8390818 it should push people further away from the use of the drug
8390819 for researchers to investigate not for clinicians and patients to be alarmed by
8390820 sometimes there appear to be safety issues with a drug that are not borne out in subsequent trials
8390821 our friend bought it on ebay for his girlfriend and then he gold leafed it and had his friend photograph it
8390822 its a guy who was excavated from a high chilean mountain cliff there were some crowns and hoards of jewelry found around him so it can be assumed he was once a great king im sure that person did not think they would end up on a stills record in 2008
8390823 they want to know about my culture thats very satisfying to me twenty years ago this would not be possible twenty years ago italians tried to sing in english sing the blues maybe that was a good thing but you can be authentic when you realize your roots thats what b b king janis joplin aretha franklin did
8390824 i dont want to lose whats mine but i want to contaminate my roots
8390825 were so packed with connected things we are starving for peculiar things
8390826 a woman who marries a man only for the purpose of exploiting him she screamed raw and theatrically
8390827 and at another point her violinist accented a song by scratching the bow on the strings for what sounded almost like the tortured meowing of an anguished cat
8390828 im going to start a tour in september and october all in america new york boston chicago l a other places
8390829 theres always been a group of african american pentecostals whove been involved in the political arena for most of the 20th century
8390830 very few of them were able to emerge to the national scene
8390831 have you been to our conventions music and waving and happiness its perfect
8390832 respectable black people that go to a congregational church or presbyterian church might look down on african americans who are pentecostals
8390833 it just makes us able to reach out to all kinds of people and be ok with who we are
8390834 i had been struggling with whether i should go into ministry or politics and i felt that god was leading me to find a way to do both but i didnt know any politician that got that intersection right
8390835 its obvious that theyre trying to make sure that the republicans dont think they have a for want of a better word corner market on god
8390836 so i applaud barack for aggressively pursuing the religious community in a manner that has not been done by the democratic party
8390837 those of us who support the democratic party despite our disagreement on this issue support it because the democratic party articulates and pursues more of the positions that are relevant to the lives and circumstances of our people the people of america in general and the people of the world
8390838 help churches find ways to help christians get to the polls
8390839 they recognize that the catholic piece is critical to electoral success
8390840 for a long time the democrats have been perceived as being secular and being even hostile to religion
8390841 it was like a gift from god for the pro life movement
8390842 for a younger generation of believers poverty is much more central to concerns of the faith
8390843 what were seeing here is a sea change in the agenda of the religious community
8390844 giving a second look at the democratic party at least the best look in a long time
8390845 ohio wouldve gone to kerry in 2004 if catholics had voted for him in the same proportion that they voted for al gore in 2000
8390846 re create 68 with the goal of re igniting the riots of 1968 around the chicago democratic convention
8390847 the sport out there felt like real sport real passion real competition
8390848 sometimes when i watch the premier league i think its becoming what is it becoming does it really mean as much to the people who are playing i think that todays players dont have that same level of emotional attachment to the clubs they represent
8390849 with so much money involved does it mean as much to the individuals in it
8390850 my worry long term is if the premier league becomes a league table of individual wealth for the 20 wealthiest individuals around the world what will that mean
8390851 it wont mean a great deal at all and that will mean we have lost something incredibly precious which is institutions like liverpool that inspire local pride
8390852 clubs have drifted too far from their supporter base in recent times and they need to come back to their roots
8390853 football finances are very fragile and we have seen examples in the past where clubs have overreached themselves and it has had devastating consequences for the supporters more than anybody
8390854 there has been concern in recent times about the way in which some clubs have been taken over the debts are just guaranteed and there isnt a great deal of new money coming into the clubs

8390864 when we first met him he was chatting to me about stuff that wed done and he knew a lot about us which was really flattering as we were big fans of his obviously
8390865 it was just one of those things where it was like do you just wanna play some stuff and see how it goes just for fun and it was good
8390866 its this weird coincidence that he happens to live part of the time where i live and part of the time where my brothers live so its not bad really it works quite well
8390867 none of them are exactly finished because the idea was we were always practicing like lets finish these songs but we end up writing new ones so we never finishing them its more fun to write new stuff
8390868 johnny was saying when i used to see the ramones i used to be like its really cool but all of them should be singing so johnny was like i wanna have a mic i wanna do some backing vocals thats what i mean hes totally part of it its dead exciting it doesnt feel like a guest weve just got a new member
8390869 i was bummed that i wasnt going to get to see rage i grew up in spain and i saw them a bunch of times in the 90s when i was a kid
8390870 they were a huge influence on me musically and politically they made people question things and made people talk about how f ed up america and europes foreign policy is theyre just a massively influential band on many different levels
8390871 i walked past tom morello at a festival in sweden but he was in the middle of a heated ping pong game

8390874 if anything performing has hindered my songwriting because im used to writing on my own pace at my leisure or while im supposed to be working a proper job i dont really have time to sit down when im not performing im usually really tired and just want to sleep

8390876 well i love you so much and its all i could do just to keep myself from telling you that i never felt so alone before
8390877 it hurts because he is the man who stood for justice
8390878 the fact of the matter is zamoyski created these works and never assigned the copyright to anyone
8390879 by law the creator retains the copyright unless he assigns it
8390880 valid agreements for the transfer of rights which are signed by the artists former employer and thus believe that there is no validity to the allegations contained in the complaint
8390881 youre not sacrificing anything and actually for me its an enhanced driving experience
8390882 i think thats a misconception people have that youre puttering around in an underpowered cramped little soapbox
8390883 its allowed people to live with these vehicles in a way that they dont have to feel restricted in the distances they can travel or where they can go
8390884 as i was putting him in the car i was wondering is it the engine noise that quiets the baby or the road noise we had no idea
8390885 we dont think the credit cycle has bottomed out yet
8390886 i would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into short term lines of credit with the treasury for working capital not to cover our losses
8390887 because seat belts can reduce the risk of injury and death in crashes by more than 50 there is a critical need for interventions to increase seat belt use by teens as both drivers and passengers
8390888 this research reinforces why state farm is actively involved in advocating for laws that help prevent injuries and deaths resulting from motor vehicle crashes its clear from these findings that primary seat belt laws for all occupants would help us accomplish that goal

8390902 i saw him go under and then i jumped off my chair ran over to him jumped in the pool
8390903 and he wasnt responding to what i was saying or anything
8390904 he was struggling there was water in his lungs so he was gurgling he would breathe every once in a while but i was mainly helping him breathe
8390905 it was kind of hard to stay calm but i knew i had to
8390906 there was a chance the gentleman may not have lived but the credit goes to the people who pulled him out of the water and started cpr
8390907 it was a scary experience so im glad hes gonna make it through alright
8390908 i thought that perhaps there should be a comparative literature of construction sites famous monuments tombs bridges houses and cities throughout history together with the thoughts of the people who built them
8390909 i know its not going to make a dent in it but i feel moved to say something about the biggest problem in online discourse pseudo persuasion
8390910 we just have to make sure those people arent messing up the experience for others
8390911 hemos recibido el apoyo t cnico de la oficina de servicios de prevenci n en la comunidad adscrita a la administraci n de familias y ni os que nos permite dar una ayuda de excelencia pero es lamentable que se tengan que afectar los servicios por el tiempo que hacienda se toma en realizar dichos desembolsos
8390912 especialmente cuando sabemos que desde que comenzamos el a o fiscal los fondos federales est n all
8390913 por poco tenemos que cerrar porque acci n social depende totalmente de los fondos federales csbg tuvimos que hacer una reuni n de todo el personal y preparar una carta e incluso informarle a los compa eros que fueran al desempleo y al programa de cupones porque hab a que cerrar las operaciones y eran 511 empleados gracias a dios y a las gestiones de p rez chiqu s logramos superar el cierre

8390928 looking at the parts we are playing im very concerned about what you think of us
8390929 like george im not sure if i should be flattered or insulted
8390930 have you seen the film and you call that a love letter
8390931 we started writing the movie as kind of an exercise thinking of what kind of parts these actors might play what kind of story they might inhabit
8390932 it could have been a dog movie or an outer space movie we just kind of landed on a spy movie
8390933 its really a funny script i didnt feel any need to wander off the script
8390934 he doesnt consider any other possibility other than what he thinks will happen i pretty much ran with that
8390935 it isnt just ok gosh i guess ill go vote for barack it means weve got really dig in and help the whole democratic ticket you know its important to elect those down ballot offices i know because i am one
8390936 he was somewhat of a maverick but hes not that person anymore
8390937 im not the public speaker in the group so well try this
8390938 i want to make very clear that barack obama is commited to iowa as the first in the way we elect the president
8390939 if senator mccain continues to be the schmuck hes being were going to play there you know and go tell some truth
8390940 we actually have four phd statisticians on our staff in chicago that do nothing all day but crunch numbers
8390941 the national polls dont matter to us we dont look at them in chicago we focus on the 18 states we have to have to win this election
8390942 we care more about the entusiasm gap in the campaign in the daily polling than we do the head to head
8390943 erg problematisch omdat tussenkomst van hogerhand absoluut nodig is zeker voor een wedstrijdbad met de daaraan verbonden voorzieningen
8390944 maar een ondernemer neemt een verliesgevende voorziening natuurlijk niet over zonder dat hier iets tegenover staat
8390945 industry standard is when you increase your fare you should see a decrease in ridership you dont expect a jump literally the next week
8390946 six or eight weeks is too short of a term to call this a trend but its definitely on the upswing
8390947 some people are angry because it stayed a dollar for so long
8390948 if inflation goes up they have to go up too
8390949 he was using smoke and mirrors and never answered any complaints
8390950 it all had to do with misappropriation of funds he wasnt giving my mom the rent money
8390951 were continuing to operate like we have and everyone is sticking with us
8390952 wed ask him and he did great lip service but your actions speak for themselves
8390953 he was lying through his teeth and it got me fired up
8390954 but i wasnt allowed to present my facts i wasnt heard so i was guilty
8390955 failed to timely request a hearing or identify any disputed issues of material fact
8390956 its hard to believe that 13 short months ago that we were just having our ground breaking
8390957 we quickly figured out that it is much more difficult having children on two campuses than we thought
8390958 we just moved up her from coral springs and we let our daughters choose their school
8390959 in may we were asked by aps to respond to mr gradys home on the belief there was a case of either an adult requiring guardianship an adult being exploited or both our investigation indicated mr grady appeared to have been exploited and had been suffering from advanced dementia for over 10 months
8390960 we were able to secure placement in an assisted living facility for mr grady
8390961 law enforcement was well aware of the growing need for an agency that would advocate for citizens we encountered who had no family no money and were unable to care for themselves
8390962 one of the very first referrals to the program involved a deputy finding an elderly woman living in the woods after being evicted from her home without this program the ability to place our most vulnerable demographic in safe environments would be severely limited she said
8390963 sue krantz our paralegal just passed the state examination for case manager certification she is a tremendous asset and the prospect of her soon being certified is wonderful
8390964 our board of directors all volunteers is very committed to the missions of this program we are accountable for the proper dispersion of any client assets compliance with florida law to ensure prompt and proper placement adhering to our budget guidelines and disseminating information about our services
8390965 once her medications were changed she became much more alert and able to contribute toward self care our goal is to move her to independent living
8390966 that is among the services we use donations to cover
8390967 if there are no funds for disposition the body goes to shands medical school there are no taxpayer funds for indigent remains in marion county
8390968 just because people are indigent or deemed incompetent should not mean they go without basic grooming aids or end up on a dissecting table without having made that choice
8390969 never would i have thought obama girl would have blown up like this its very surreal
8390970 my license plate could be as pro life as i am
8390971 this isnt surprising only a small number of reporters actually have a reason to be here
8390972 the press head count of 15 000 is staggering and absolutely worth questioning
8390973 great tasmanian pipeline will deliver boags draft dircetly from tassie to tap
8390974 remove blacktop or sidewalk dig trench below street level construction of beer pipeline
8390975 he has charisma hes smart hes good he talks like a person he doesnt sound like hes yelling at you
8390976 that to me is whats important about this and about my commitment and my presence here
8390977 industry says its money is intended solely to keep doctors up to date critics charge that companies agree to support only classes that promote their products
8390978 i want to make sure were not marketing for industry or being influenced by their marketing
8390979 its a good plan and its a big deal that a place like stanford has adopted it
8390980 when this is all over medical education will not be the same as what its been
8390981 reforms based on transparency can foster accountability and build confidence in medical education and in turn the practice of medicine
8390982 americas pharmaceutical research companies have taken positive steps to help ensure they provide nothing but accurate and balanced information to health care providers
8390983 i have to say katie holmes has become so much more sophisticated in so many ways but i think shes in a dip right now i cant explain it she ascended from this tomboyish waif look to an incredible sexy sophisticate we realize how much style shes capable of i dont get it

8390986 the time for change has come and barack obama is the change we need
8390987 shall the county enact an ordinance to increase real estate taxes in order to repeal the alcoholic drink tax
8390988 the board of directors is firmly committed to dan mudd
8390989 the board will continue to work closely with dan and his management team to guide the company and support the housing finance system through a very challenging period
8390990 this team will be responsible for meeting the dual objectives of conserving capital and controlling credit losses while fannie mae continues to provide crucial liquidity to the u s housing and
8390991 this was probably a necessary step but not one thats going to determine the future of fannie mae clearly the fate of fannie and freddie is in the hands of policymakers
8390992 at the behest of blackstone to attempt to crush two innocent individuals
8390993 this was a preconceived operation by blackstone to show its strength

8390996 there were two other occasions in recent american history when government raised taxes going into economic decline herbert hoover tried it in the early 1930s jimmy carter tried it in the late 1970s carter was the lucky one he got only a deep recession hoover got the great depression
8390997 last week as i walked around the hood i started noticing something a tad bit disturbing the closing of many new businesses in spite of

8390999 i like to be able to cook for gavin and have a nice clean house when he comes home and clean clothes
8391000 im not lazy when it comes to the baby and my house im quite obsessive compulsive about cleaning

8391171 i have been in the cissp world for more than 10 years now
8391172 i have taught it for about eight years for corporate and government agencies i have written books on it developed products webinars study materials etc
8391173 over the years i have noticed that students who are attempting to achieve their cissp have changed their approach rather than fully understanding the topics in the common body of knowledge cbk many individuals are simply memorizing the key components they will most likely see on the exam individuals the companies they work for and the industry as a whole are all cheated by this approach
8391174 taking advantage of self paced learning can better prepare students for the cissp certification exam and for future challenges they will face in the field

8391181 dealers exhibiting at any other british convention 5 weeks prior to the blackpool convention will not be offered a dealer booth at blackpool

8391187 spam is a huge problem and costs the american labor market more than 70 billion dollars a year in lost earnings spam is also a major source of annoyance for employees and it specialists and also presents a security risk when viruses and trojans are sent out as spam emails to millions of recipients

8391200 for any employer who fails to provide a meal period or rest period as required in california the financial exposure can be significant
8391201 this court would have an employer accept the onerous responsibility of making certain that each and every employee actually takes the complete rest period or meal period regardless of the number of employees or where such employees might be physically located and despite off site work responsibilities e g transportation delivery that might make such oversight impossible it is an impossible standard for an employer to satisfy it would encourage employees to game the system for financial rewards
8391202 these federal district court judges decided that an employer is only required to provide the opportunity to take such breaks but then it is the employees responsibility to ensure that such breaks are taken
8391203 the brinker court even offered flexibility to employers on the timing of such breaks
8391204 this court stated that rest periods need only be authorized every four hours and need not be taken in the middle of each work period where doing so would be impractical it also construed the statutory language of the california labor code to permit employers to offer a meal period anytime within the five hour work period window
8391205 this appellate courts ruling in the brinker case is the polar opposite of the appellate courts position in cicairos the two positions cannot be reconciled
8391206 the reasoning and decisions of the appellate court in brinker as well as the decisions of the federal district courts offer a rational interpretation and application of california law ensuring greater employer compliance with the duty to provide meal periods and rest periods to employees these decisions shift responsibility for taking breaks to the employees where such responsibility should be placed

8391211 after 20 years of fulltime rving i still discovered new information after reading the rv book marks book is so well written and informative he patiently explains each basic necessity that every rver should be aware of to assure safe operation of their rv
8391212 rvs give us the freedom to go wherever we want whenever we want but nothing will ruin a trip or a vacation quicker than not understanding how to properly use and maintain your rv the rv book is so informational and practical especially for those new to rving rv owners and soon to be owners will thoroughly understand what a recreation vehicle is how to buy it and once they own it how to use it

8391240 people in gyms perform hundreds of unnecessary workouts that have zero chance of transforming their bodies
8391241 most people have no idea they are wasting their time because theyve never been told the underlying principles of strength training
8391242 they expend energy and tire themselves out so they think their efforts are working so people perform hundreds of unnecessary workouts that have zero chance of transforming their bodies
8391243 ive never been a hard core bodybuilder those guys want to spend maximum time in the gym because thats their hobby but for me lifting weights is a means to get stronger so that i can use the strength doing something i enjoy outside of the gym and so i can get the health benefits of having more lean mass
8391244 i started researching ways i could significantly increase my strength in the least amount of time since i dont like spending lots of time in a gym
8391245 if you want to get strong the trump card is to lift a heavier weight for a very brief period rather than lift a lighter weight many times using multiple repetitions and several sets of repetitions as most people do static contraction training shows people how to lift the heaviest weight they can in only their strongest and safest range of motion but to hold the weight statically for only five seconds
8391246 so to train for the car lift my son did a 5 second leg press with the most weight he could hold then he took about a week off and came back and did another 5 second lift with a bit more weight thats how you know the previous workout was productive and you gave yourself adequate recovery time because only then do you see an increase in your strength after nine of those 5 second lifts he progressed to the point of being able to lift over 2 500 lbs on the leg press theres no magic to it and thats my point anyone can get this strong
8391247 the value of strength training is hugely underrated unfortunately many people have been conditioned to think of grotesque muscularity and rampant steroid use when they think about lifting weights thats a tragedy because strength along with aerobics and flexibility is one of the three measurements of overall fitness and speaking as a middle aged person muscularity is a key biomarker of aging so the more muscular a man or woman is the younger he or she is
8391248 its a well established medical fact that productive weightlifting delivers increased lean mass increased calorie burn at rest lower blood pressure and a half dozen other health benefits but most people are very busy and setting aside time for three 45 minute workouts every week is just not practical
8391249 i like to say the three biggest lies in strength training are monday wednesday and friday
8391250 the absolute key to making consistent progress is to give your body time to fully recover and to also add a bit of new muscle that takes time and the stronger you get the more you lift so you need more time to recover many people can train productively lifting weights only once per month
8391251 if my son or anyone else tried to leg press a car three times a week he would fail because full recovery and compensation takes longer than that so most people working out three times a week are just wasting their effort the truth is anyone can reach his or her desired strength and muscularity in 1 to 2 of the total training time they devote to conventional training methods and schedules so my training is ideal for busy people who want fitness results but dont want to make a hobby or a second job out of exercise almost everyone can afford time for 25 seconds of exercise once a month

8391449 companies that have chosen not to implement network virtualization in their virtual datacenter are only realizing part of the benefits
8391450 server and storage virtualization has cut provisioning times from days or weeks to minutes but manually provisioning correct vlan and security configurations still takes days or weeks delaying roll outs and exposing servers to a new class of security risks network virtualization closes this gap and completes the virtual datacenter

8391482 customer service is our priority no matter what the job is we do it we very rarely have to turn anyone away no matter how short a period of time is involved to get it done
8391483 i looked around at a number of different businesses before settling on this and the jaxquickfit connection was a major part of the decision
8391484 thats our strength because they give us a great range of quality products and because of their buying power they can do it at a great price and we can pass on those savings to the customer there really is something for every budget in this range and our customers know we dont rip them off so they come back

8391491 traffic numbers for june alone increased more than 100 year over year from 2007 and a lot of that success is due to viators allowing us to participate in the planning of their site enhancements

8391526 but dont we need a credit card to build a good credit score
8391527 student loan information will sometimes multiply like rabbits on the credit report because student loans are sold from one company to another and the old company continues reporting and then the new company continues reporting it and it might make it look like you have more loans than you actually do then if theyre showing any late payments you can get hit with double whammies on late payments as well

8391540 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8391541 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8391542 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8391543 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8391555 i encourage investors new to tax lien investing to first just watch live sales for a while and study the deals before buying anything similar to virtual stock trading once they are ready to make their first purchase begin with a very small tax certificate say under 200 300 after they do a few small deals successfully and get comfortable with the process then start increasing the size of their deals along with the number of cities and property types in their portfolio the best thing about our site is that unlike most sites visitors can actually watch live auctions for free for as long as they like to get familiar with the process and even watch tutorials without buying anything we have partnered with a few very well known online players to deliver a list of new tax sales to our subscribers everyday in a secure online shopping environment
8391556 the building was a most distinguished landmark seen from miles in every direction in one of the worlds greatest commercial centres
8391557 asia insurance building was an attraction as many parents brought their children there for a view of the tallest building in southeast asia it was the premium office building at the time space in the tower was s 1 per square feet five times more than the 20 cents per square feet cost at other buildings i have fond memories of my time there to me it is one of the few buildings which can be truly considered singapores national architecture heritage i am glad that the building is being preserved and with added glamour as the new ascott raffles place

8391570 couples counselor can finalize the end of a relationship in crisis
8391571 marriage counseling with the wrong couples counselor can finalize the end of a relationship in crisis youve probably known of couples that went to marriage counseling and wound up breaking up
8391572 its possible that the wrong therapist can do a troubled relationship more harm than good and even contribute to a final breakup
8391573 most relationships end unnecessarily and the breakup could have been prevented especially if the couple had gone to the right kind of marriage counselor
8391574 other counselors believe that with rare exception an individual and or couple should do everything possible to learn and master the skills to make their relationship work and thus to save their relationship and often their family unit those type of therapists are relationship savers its my experience that for most relationships in crisis when an individual or couple get the right kind of help and training and consistently practice those skills that they can actually not just stay together but can both thrive staying together
8391575 usually the person that has initiated the breakup has been trying to get their partner to go to relationship counseling with them they have been put off or flatly told no ive worked with some couples where the person that wants to end the relationship had been rejected by their partner for weeks months and even years in their efforts to get them both into couple counseling initiating finding and going to a couples counselor as soon as possible demonstrates a persons willingness to be responsive to what the leaving partner has wanted it can also help the leaving partner to get past one of their biggest objections to giving their mate a last chance which is their concern that theres no reason to believe that anything will be different one of the primary reasons the leaving partner wanted to go to a relationship counselor in the first place is that they thought that it could help to make the relationship workable for them
8391576 how a person prepares for a relationship counseling session and how they conduct themselves in that session can make a big difference in how effective it is
8391577 each person think about what they most want help with to improve in themselves which would make the biggest difference in improving their relationship the couples that are the most proactive in planning for their marriage counseling sessions and are the most proactive and consistent in practicing and mastering the skills they are taught by a relationship saving therapist get the best results by leaps and bounds
8391578 i am excited and honored to be able to serve those who come to allegany college of marylands center for continuing education the commitment to high quality educational programming and a caring and dedicated staff provide tremendous learning opportunities and a warm and welcoming environment for our students

8391662 when it comes to cosmetic surgery or any medical procedure you never want to put yourself in inexperienced hands
8391663 with a cosmetic procedure that is fairly new like the butt lift it can be difficult to find a skilled surgeon but because of the high volume of patients that colombian surgeons see as well as the length of time they have been performing the procedure a butt lift is as common to colombia surgeons as breast augmentation so our clients get experienced surgeons performing the brazilian butt lift

8391670 i was reading my book the driver honked the horn slammed on the brakes and the train goes squish
8391671 not much was going through my head stuff happens i used to be with search and rescue and ive seen this from the other side often enough
8391672 everyone basically just grabbed their cellphones called 911 and made sure everybody was ok
8391673 considering the train did derail and depending on the volume of passengers that could have been on the train and if it were a different time of day things could have been substantially worse
8391674 the driver as well as a patient we took sustained the brunt of the collision because it was at the front of the train but even he is in stable condition at this point in time
8391675 all i can say at this point is there was a miscommunication as to whether or not the boom was supposed to be over the track when the train hit it
8391676 i would say its unlikely that there will be any criminal charges from the police end i imagine it would be something that occupational health and safety and their own departments look at as far as the people involved will be dealt with
8391677 they had requested a lane closure which is also deemed a signal lockout and that was authorized for 10 30 a m
8391678 if you look at the distance from where the boom is which is where contact was made and where the train stopped you can see how fast it was going
8391679 the train is travelling about 80 kilometres an hour so we can see it was quite an abrupt halt
8391680 when i feel like the most normal person in the room theres a problem
8391681 jar naik mobil sendiri itu jauh lebih menguntungkan dibandingkan naik kereta lho

8391794 i am continuously amazed at how few resources we put towards the brain when it is the most complex organ in the human body we are murdering ourselves more than others yet we hide it under the rug shadowed by shame what is happening that is making us turn against ourselves
8391795 we spend billions on wars across the globe and i wonder when we are going to spend that kind of money finding peaceful resolutions to the wars going on in the mind depression has taken the lives of many way too early wasted so many good years for others and it is time we understand why and encourage people to get treatment so they can improve the lives of all

8391804 we are actively seeking property owners in the jackson hole market areas who want to auction their property for 100 percent of the current market value with no seller commission to enter their properties prior to the monday september 1st deadline
8391805 as one of only 322 accredited auctioneers of real estates aare in the united states we can deliver a higher level of service than 98 6 of real estate professionals in the marketplace
8391806 last year we auctioned two homes in teton springs and delivered 660 000 and 715 000 for a private seller who had purchased based on pre construction appraisals with inflated resale values of 1 4 to 1 6 million each our seller could not make the 18 000 payments for property in a subdivision that only had two arms length transactions during 2007 and they had no hope of selling using traditional methods
8391807 if you read the newspapers listen to the radio or watch the news on tv the message is nothing but doom and gloom about the real estate market
8391808 if you are trying to sell using the broken list price put up a sign and place it in the mls methods they are correct and your property can sit on the market for years with no bids or contingency
8391809 people selling real estate in the jackson hole market think they are immune to the nationwide correction in real estate values with almost every agent saying the same things agents in orange county california were telling us two years ago which is it cant happen here there is too much demand prices will never go down
8391810 july 2008 saw an actual 28 percent across the board decrease in orange county property values
8391811 this could be the tip of the iceberg or the prices can hold the line depending on a number of factors outside of the control of sellers agents or the local market
8391812 the good news is an auction is an event where bidders win the property and are happy knowing they only paid one bid more than someone else was willing to pay
8391813 competitive bidding will deliver 100 percent of the present cash market value for a property on a specific date in
8391814 this is the selling event of the season if a property owner wants to sell their property on september 20th this auction event will simply deliver more marketing firepower than the local agents are capable of delivering

8391830 leading edge educator training paradigms now include the notion that practices promoting student safety and welfare supersede all other educator responsibilities while the education of americas young is still the primary function of its schools and education systems the past decade has notably brought to light the need for increased educator training in school safety security and emergency management gone are the days when educators were allowed to handle threats to student body safety and security yet few educator training programs or states include required course work in this topic as part of pre service training or educator certification
8391831 the america school safety crisis response kit crk offers a compact method to satisfy this need and to build partnerships with professionals whose day to day vocation is the safety and welfare of society it presents a ready made safety crisis preparation kit a prevention and response plan based on active successful models and provides a template for customizing a comprehensive school safety security and emergency response program in cooperation with local and state officials designed by experienced educators and licensed security professionals its recommendations were developed in concert with homeland security publications regarding policies regulations practices and training components in brief the america school safety crisis response kit provides an uncomplicated logical and common sense approach to school crisis planning and response
8391832 my winemaking philosophy evolved from a deceptively simple statement my grandmother used to say to me make good wine
8391833 by that she meant make wine that invites a second glass and so my goal was to create powerful yet elegant wines from the highest quality napa valley grapes that could be enjoyed on their own or with a meal
8391834 when i saw the land that would later become my amino vineyard i knew id found the place that would mark my return to winemaking
8391835 the first vintages from amino didnt reflect the level of maturity that was needed for the style of wine i was after so i decided to wait until i felt the grapes reached their full potential the 2005 vintage produced fruit of exceptional quality and i felt the resulting wine was finally ready for debut
8391836 i was shocked to see that only 20 of survey respondents strongly agreed that they know who their best shoppers are
8391837 worse yet absolutely no poorly performing retailers self identified that they do if you dont know who your best shoppers are and develop targeted ways to engage them you wont stand a chance at keeping them
8391838 it is the hope of newts playing cards that a fun deck of political playing cards like politically wild will catch peoples attention and get them to take more of an active interest in politics

8391878 some granite countertops particularly those mined from quarries in south america and africa emit possibly dangerous levels of radon and radiation
8391879 and given the way granite has skyrocketed in popularity in recent years there could be thousands of people in the tri state area being exposed to cancer causing radiation within their own homes every day while it is unlikely that all of these granite pieces are emitting dangerous levels of radiation we feel like homeowners should decide for themselves whether or not to take risks they can easily avoid
8391880 why take the chance when there are many attractive and safe alternatives that are also made of sustainable eco friendly materials
8391881 with all of the other environmental dangers facing the world today i think most homeowners would feel satisfied minimizing any variables that might affect their overall health
8391882 for those homeowners looking to reduce their carbon footprint green products like icestone richlite caesarstone and bamboo are also derived from sustainable materials that actually help reduce some of atmospheric toxins created by mass production
8391883 in fact we created the myhome green section of our website http myhomeus com to help clients find a full range of green products such as low voc paints and others that further reduce the chances of air contamination
8391884 its imperative that homeowners become more aware of the products they take into their homes
8391885 while picking a kitchen countertop might not seem like a life and death decision at the time not knowing where it comes from and how it is made can be problematic especially since consumers spend years if not decades with the products they bring into their lives

8391893 all of us owe george soros a great deal of gratitude
8391894 he thinks the ballot question is a responsible initiative to reduce the overreliance on criminal justice sanctions in dealing with marijuana
8391895 marijuana should not be a priority of the criminal justice system
8391896 decriminalizing marijuana is a slippery slope and sends the wrong message
8391897 compounding this is the fact that users of marijuana are 10 times more likely to be injured or injure others in automobile crashes
8391898 they can move on and get a student loan and get their first apartment and move on with their lives
8391899 people recognize that there are a lot better things we could be doing with our police resources
8391900 i heard about it on one of the local news stations on my commute in that they were offering the chance to drive these
8391901 youre not sacrificing anything and actually for me its an enhanced driving experience
8391902 i think thats a misconception people have that youre puttering around in an underpowered cramped little soapbox
8391903 its allowed people to live with these vehicles in a way that they dont have to feel restricted in the distances they can travel or where they can go
8391904 as i was putting him in the car i was wondering is it the engine noise that quiets the baby or the road noise we had no idea
8391905 transparency trust and control with respect to the sites they visit
8391906 if ie8 helps heighten awareness of this value exchange thats a step in the right direction
8391907 today as a user we have no visibility or control over how that information is shared and recorded
8391908 i wouldnt put microsoft as being the arbiter of what should and shouldnt be tracked
8391909 i think microsoft realizes we all realize that its a beta version and its sure to change before its finalized
8391910 it is traditional that we have nominations that we have a roll call
8391911 that we have candidates who look for ways to work to make sure that we come out of here ready to win in november
8391912 as part of that tradition im here today to release you as my delegates
8391913 i want you to know that this has been a joy we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time trying
8391914 by last count according to the press and other official sources i had about 1920 delegates
8391915 i believe that as democrats and as americans we will leave denver united

8391919 hes one of our main guys but we dont think its a season ending injury
8391920 the time frame it fluctuates but hopefully with his youth and hes been pretty durable and resilient to injury hopefully he does get back soon
8391921 with the off season moves we made hopefully we can still play at a high level this year to me its more something that you look at as a challenge and you dont let it defeat you you deal with it
8391922 training camp was going to be an important part of his development
8391923 thats going to be postponed obviously but hes got a lot of development on and off the court that hes going to continue to do ive got a lot of confidence in him and now his job is to get healthy
8391924 just in talking to nellie today were talking about maybe spreading that ball around and getting scoring from different areas
8391925 marcus is more of a pass first point guard if at some point he thought he didnt get a chance in new jersey hes going to get a chance now
8391926 ideally id like everybody here in oakland all the time but thats not realistic i think one thing monta has done each and every year is improve and i do believe most improvement is made during the summer thats when guys do get better so i cant debate that
8391927 we want to make a strong statement with these vans that they are reliable great value and very cool rather than trying to grab attention with offensive pictures and slogans the only thing wicked about these chubbys is the price
8391928 we know that backpackers want to explore in something that they can tell their mates back home about and show off in photos so we developed some pretty unique body decals for these vans add to this the fact that the chubbys are basically brand new extremely comfortable and just about the cheapest budget van on the road and there is no real reason to rent something that looks smells and drives a lot worse
8391929 these things are like a private room on wheels and they actually cost less than a private room in a hostel its taken a long time to build up our reputation within the backpacker industry and adding high quality great value products to our fleet sits perfectly with our image the backpacker campervan industry has suffered some bad press lately but we are determined not to be tarred with the same brush
8391930 with the support of firm recruitment partners such as the american institute of architects weve assembled a critical mass of firms
8391931 the range of work being undertaken by these firms is a testament to the need for and power of design
8391932 if every architecture professional in the country were to pledge just 1 of their time to pro bono service it would be the equivalent of a massive firm like hok working fulltime for the public good
8391933 one need only look at the sheer productive capacity of large firms like hok and perkins will to understand what a commitment of this scale from the profession as a whole could mean for our communities and country
8391934 in all these projects represent the many applications of design the power of pro bono service as well as the range of needs to be addressed in communities across the country
8391935 much work remains but one can only be encouraged and inspired by the joint efforts undertaken by firm participants of the 1 program
8391936 one of our biggest reasons to continue working with ceridian is because of the savings we will realize by continuing to make these services available to our employees
8391937 we are proud to offer our employees online access to pay stubs health insurance vacation and sick leave and all the rest of their benefits information

8391944 the ability to identify engage hire develop and retain talent has never been more pressing or complex
8391945 icims is proud to co sponsor the aberdeen groups talent acquisition strategies report this year and we are enthusiastic about what the research reveals
8391946 this report reaffirms that icims is an ideal solution provider for organizations interested in going global as well as for hr departments interested in expanding their talent management software to include tools outside of applicant tracking such as workforce planning or performance management
8391947 organizations that aggressively pursue talent acquisition strategies are more likely to invest in technology solutions that help them better locate and engage job candidates assess the skills and attributes of those candidates and bring applicants on board that are more likely to succeed in their new job roles this gives the organization advantages in both recruiting and retention
8391948 web based talent solutions are not the wave of the future but the present and an increasing number of companies are seizing the advantages provided by these tools
8391949 short of owning a crystal ball attending this webinar is the best way for hr professionals to get a good look at whats happening now and whats on the way
8391950 we provide a practical interactive format to help attendees prepare for the economic and legal challenges ahead

8391967 the best part about the break for us is we got to stay in first place for a month
8391968 all three teams have had great runs during the season and times where we struggled with injuries or whatever im just looking forward to see what happens
8391969 this break was good to defuse some of the negative publicity surrounding the incident we had
8391970 we felt we have a good opportunity to compete for an eastern conference championship this year and next year
8391971 shes an experienced player and makes our team better with her calmness and her pointers to our players

8391986 patients who used statins before an ami heart attack and continued to take them after were 16 percent less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them
8391987 so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your heart attack it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8391988 because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami

8391993 it appears to be an internal software processing problem were going to have to do some forensics on it
8391994 so what we had to do was dump all of the flight plan information that was in the system and then manually enter the people who were waiting to take off

8392015 black history is not just about slavery it is much broader than that it is about the contribution that black and asian people have made throughout history the benefits are that pupils gain a better appreciation of the multicultural society around them and the contribution they can make

8392023 we will drastically cut our diplomatic ties with russia up to consuls or envoys

8392031 a well regulated legal finance market is a very competitive consumer friendly thing this is a new market where firms are trying to create options for consumers and meet an acute need
8392032 the ohio bill that passed has a number of important elements that will protect consumers most notably the requirement that the consumers lawyer must be involved in the process and that there be full disclosure on all the terms of the legal funding advance
8392033 the corporate interests in our lawsuit funding space have very little lobbying power compared to the powerful corporate interests in the insurance industry where they make their profits on desperate plaintiffs who are forced to accept settlement offers that are less than they deserve we give these desperate plaintiffs the funds so they can wait for their full settlements when the lending process is regulated as it will be in ohio its a win win scenario based on the number of ohio residents weve had to turn down for funding over the last few years this bill was long overdue
8392034 i am thrilled to be a part of such a relevant and forward thinking approach to a globally important topic and mission

8392045 before we conducted these analyses we knew based on evidence from previous studies that we might expect acceleration in decline on cognitive abilities before death
8392046 and our findings clearly showed there to be a pattern of terminal decline even among relatively healthy individuals that the brain changes that influence our cognitive abilities in old age occur over a relatively long period of time even among individuals who remain non demented until they die

8392060 a formidable army composed of audacious barbarians is descending on this island these persons my brothers are the enemies of jesus christ today it is a question of the defense of our faith as to whether the gospels are to be superseded by the koran god on this occasion demands of us our lives already vowed to his service happy will be those who first consummate this sacrifice
8392061 if politeness and ceremony be observed toward mohammedans they imagine they are feared and become arrogant but in showing severity and rudeness they are impressed with fear and respect and they are supple and manageable
8392062 its going to be much harder to deal with the sons of allah than with the nazis or imperial japan much longer and much harder unless the rest of the western world stops peeing its pants and starts reasoning a little and gives a hand
8392063 i am speaking to those who though not stupid or evil are wallowing in prudence and doubt
8392064 intimidated as you are by your fear of going against the current that is appearing racist a word which is entirely inapt as we are speaking not about a race but about a religion you dont understand or dont want to understand that a reverse crusade is in progress
8392065 accustomed as you are to the double cross blinded as you are by myopia you dont understand or dont want to understand that a war of religion is in progress desired and declared by a fringe of that religion perhaps but a war of religion nonetheless a war which they call jihad holy war
8392066 a war that might not seek to conquer our territory note in the philippines that war is seeking to conquer territory but that certainly seeks to conquer our souls
8392067 that seeks the disappearance of our freedom and our civilization
8392068 that seeks to annihilate our way of living and dying our way of praying or not praying our way of eating and drinking and dressing and entertaining and informing ourselves
8392069 you dont understand or dont want to understand that if we dont oppose them if we dont defend ourselves if we dont fight the jihad will win
8392070 and it will destroy the world that for better or worse weve managed to build to change to improve to render a little more intelligent that is to say less bigoted or even not bigoted at all
8392071 and with that it will destroy our culture our art our science our morals our values our pleasures
8392072 dont you even care about that you fools i am an atheist thank god and i have no intention of letting myself be killed for it
8392073 for twenty years ive been saying it for twenty years with a certain meekness not with this passion twenty years ago i wrote an editorial on this subject for the corriere
8392074 it was an article by a person used to being with all races and all creeds a citizen used to fighting all forms of fascism and intolerance a lay person without taboos
8392075 but it was also an article by a person indignant at those who failed to smell the stench of a coming holy war and who were letting the the sons of allah get away with a little too much
8392076 i made an argument that went more or less like this twenty years ago what sense is there in respecting those who dont respect us
8392077 some are neither happy nor unhappy they couldnt care less about september 11 americas far away anyhow theres an ocean between america and europe oh no my dear friends theres a mere thread of water
8392078 because when the destiny of the west the survival of our civilization is at stake we are new york
8392079 americans measure everything with money they only think of money
8392080 christ i dont deny anyone the right to be afraid anyone whos not afraid of war is an idiot and as ive written a thousand times before anyone who acts as though hes not afraid of war is both an idiot and a liar
8392081 but in life and in history there are times when one is not permitted to be afraid times when being afraid is immoral and uncivilized and those who evade this tragedy out of weakness or lack of courage or habitual fence straddling strike me as masochists
8392082 masochists yes masochists why do you want to talk about what you call the contrast between the two cultures well if you really must know it bothers me to even talk about two cultures to put them on the same plane as though they were two parallel realities of equal weight and equal measure
8392083 because behind our civilization we have homer socrates plato aristotle phydias for gods sake we have ancient greece with its parthenon and its discovery of democracy
8392084 we have ancient rome with its greatness its laws its concept of law its sculptures its literature its architecture its buildings its amphitheaters its aqueducts its bridges and its roads
8392085 we have a revolutionary that christ who died on the cross who taught us too bad if we didnt learn it the concept of love and of justice
8392086 yes i know theres also a church that gave me the inquisition
8392087 and then behind our civilization we also have the renaissance
8392088 and finally we have science for gods sake a science that has understood a lot of diseases and that cures them i am still alive for now thanks to our science not mohammeds
8392089 a science that has invented marvellous machines the train the car the airplane the spaceships with which weve gone to the moon and mars and soon will go who knows where a science that has changed the face of this planet with electricity the radio the telephone the tv and by the way is it true that the gurus of the left dont want to say what i have just said god what pricks they will never change
8392090 if their men are so silly as not to drink beer or wine ditto
8392091 but if they presume to impose the same things on me in my home
8392092 and they do presume it osama bin laden says that the entire planet earth must become muslim that we must convert to islam that he will convert us by fair means or foul that this is why he massacres us and will continue to do so
8392093 and this cant be pleasing to us it cant help but make us itch to turn the tables and kill him
8392094 but this thing wont end wont die out with the death of osama bin laden because there are tens of thousands of osama bin ladens by now and theyre not only in afghanistan or in other arabic countries
8392095 theyre everywhere and the most hardened ones are right in the western world in our cities in our roads in our universities in the ganglions of technology that technology that any dolt can handle
8392096 the crusade i e the jihad dda has been in progress for some time it works like a swiss watch sustained by a faith and a malice comparable only to the faith and malice of torquemada when he led the inquisition
8392097 the fact is that dealing with them is impossible reasoning unthinkable treating them with indulgence tolerance or hope suicide whoever thinks differently is deluded
8392098 the fact is that dealing with them mohammedans is impossible reasoning unthinkable treating them with indulgence tolerance or hope suicide whoever thinks differently is deluded
8392099 the secret of happiness is freedom and the secret of freedom is courage

8392104 this community is a microcosm of the entire sierra leone where 75 percent of the population is poor according to the countrys poverty reduction strategy paper a fitting place to launch the state of human rights report in sierra leone 2007
8392105 this national public health emergency is not being treated with the seriousness it deserves
8392106 the government is under a positive obligation according to national and international human rights law to take the necessary steps to reduce these high levels
8392107 much progress in the observance of the freedom of expression
8392108 government was tolerant and accommodating to musicians who produced songs many of which are critical of members of the government and the prevailing socio economic and political situation

8392112 most grape production in chile takes place during u s winter months when there is little or no fresh grape production within the united states with which to compete
8392113 we know theres going to be overarching concern over the possible introduction of pests
8392114 once we do the analysis well be advocating our position accordingly
8392115 the whole question here is does it increase the risk of the introduction of invasive pests
8392116 the presence of imported grapes within the domestic market during the u s off season allows for year round availability of the product and promotes domestic consumption
8392117 what we want to do is to provide an alternative an option its not that people dont want to use mac os many people are open to the idea but theyre not used to spending an exorbitant amount of money on something that is essentially generic hardware
8392118 i believe it the probe will finish this year for sure
8392119 i dont know whats happening now for me i think its good im trying to think only of the tennis
8392120 i still play i dont want to quit tennis im still trying to play better and better hopefully i can find my game and my confidence
8392121 its tough to say about federer he was for so many years number one and won every grand slam this year was not so great for him
8392122 maybe hes tired you cannot be number one forever i hope that hes not so top fit maybe is level is like that of any other player
8392123 you never know what can happen at us open the top six or eight guys can now win it but i dont want to speak about my chances

8392128 w hy not position a senator like claire mccaskill up there for five minutes and let her throw some red meat out to the crowd
8392129 they recently made some needed changes to the track and i think it is going to be good they added a chicane in the turn 4 esses and slowed the final corner way down plus created a new angle it is pretty much going to be like racing on a new track
8392130 doing well at the last two races has really brought my confidence way up
8392131 i took both wins last year at this track and that naturally is my goal again it might be a little tougher because of all the changes to the track i really liked the old one in fact they took away some of my favorite parts however luckily for me i like new tracks and tend to adapt very quickly i think we are good to go
8392132 working with pair a nines is a labor of love for me
8392133 i worked with jay for about 11 years and when this opportunity came up i pretty much jumped at the chance it is a way for me to pay back someone who made me look like a hero for a great number of years
8392134 a friend of mine convinced me to go watch former ama champion carroll resweber and watching him definitely inspired me to get into racing
8392135 i started running in local scramble events and then moved into flat tracking on a harley sprint i worked my way up through the ranks as a novice then a junior and finally earned my expert license
8392136 there were eight people in the department at that time
8392137 and i pretty much started at the bottom when you were new you were treated like you didnt know anything and i figure that was probably right but you muddled along and picked up things sort of paying your dues
8392138 ive had a lot of fun over the years and i am really pleased to be working with springer and the entire pair a nines team
8392139 they are a terrific group and it is a great series were currently tied for points so new jersey motorsports park is definitely going to be an important round for us a win would really help going in to the final and that is what we are aiming for the m4 avteq team who we are tied with is also a first class effort and they are going to be tough to beat the racing action is definitely going to be good its a brand new track so everyone will be on the same level were excited and will be ready to roll off the grid when the green flag waves
8392140 one of our goals is to enhance learning by creating easy access to educational resources
8392141 with qwest we can enable virtual classrooms and a curriculum that benefits teachers faculty students and the community
8392142 the thieves have to take it to someone who can melt it down extract the platinum and then resell it on the open market
8392143 mccain is still fighting red china in vietnam and the soviet union in the cold war he will be an unstable bridge back to an increasingly distant 20th century america
8392144 if you lie about me i will tell the truth about you
8392145 mccains pow experience is no special qualification for the u s president
8392146 can you afford four more years of the bush mccain mess
8392147 need to examine the fundamental rights of the 23 million people of the republic of china taiwan to participate meaningfully in the activities of u n specialized agencies
8392148 in the late 1980s with the japanese economy booming many foreign curators started coming to japan to see the art
8392149 it was like what happened to china a few years ago and what is happening to india now
8392150 foreign curators would ask the same question who are the good artists but japanese curators would never answer
8392151 a lot of japanese curators are just too domestic minded
8392152 i looked and spoke in the same way the foreign curators did
8392153 i was married to a french woman and she trained me
8392154 young curators and younger japanese in general are part of the international community from a much younger age
8392155 on battlestar galactica as well as this nobody is or was trying to remake the original show its a reimagining and youre using the fundamentals youre using the concept but its fairly loose this is a man and a car but its a whole different show
8392156 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8392157 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8392158 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
8392159 i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8392160 now what do you do throw out a red handkerchief whats the format what do you do id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie
8392161 imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8392162 nobodys told us anything i think we should be schooled on it somehow
8392163 this is not going to work come on i shouldnt say it nots going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8392164 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8392165 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8392166 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8392167 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8392168 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8392169 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8392170 we know the parameters of the contract and the giants would have been generous
8392171 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8392172 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8392173 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8392174 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8392175 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8392176 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8392177 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8392178 i mean im healthy i could play its just not in the cards this week i think mainly because we played saturday and turn around and play again on thursday
8392179 im not putting you down i want to help you
8392180 um actually i listen to too much reggae music and dont have those kind of cds by the artists on the compilation so this is a chance for me to study japanese pop music history
8392181 we expect that number to increase dramatically with the easing of visa restrictions and expected expansion in airlift
8392182 i used to buy fish for dinner now i buy meat
8392183 the era of companies just adding temporary workers is probably over
8392184 full timers are crucial for companies to increase productivity accumulate knowledge and develop human resources to expand
8392185 easing the pain that rising food and gasoline prices are inflicting
8392186 there was no other way we could have that many shop staff gain the product knowledge needed to satisfy our customers
8392187 is definitely durable as the population is going to keep getting older
8392188 this could potentially become more pronounced in 2009 and 2010
8392189 room to transfer younger people from part time to full time
8392190 we have no intention to be guarded or aggressive against the government
8392191 were not demanding a big move of the envisioned airfield
8392192 we believe what we are requesting is within the range of the 2006 agreement with the united states and would cause no trouble to the united states
8392193 my guess is that the u s places priority on seeing this settled it prefers to see it settled with some technical modification rather than opening the whole issue up
8392194 reports of the development in north korea in addition to the nuclear issue in iran are major challenges to nonproliferation and nuclear disarmament efforts
8392195 it is vital that the international community strengthen nonproliferation efforts with a stronger nuclear nonproliferation treaty to appropriately handle the issue
8392196 i think forever im going to be his little sister
8392197 if she does everything the opposite of what ive been doing she will be no 1 for a long time
8392198 shes totally ready to win her first grand slam im really proud of the way shes handling the pressure
8392199 this would be the most amazing thing that can happen
8392200 letzter versuch der besuch eines der wie schwammerln aus dem boden wachsenden in lokale
8392201 quel plaisir de r unir ces deux acteurs l dans des r les de sympathques cr tins
8392202 it hasnt sunk in yet that were going to japan im floating on sunshine
8392203 weve been working on these costumes for five months i havent slept for the last two weeks and she hasnt slept for the last four weeks
8392204 im good at making wigs and she has good armor making skills
8392205 one of our props broke just before the competition and we had all the other finalists trying to help us fix it
8392206 australian cosplayers do reflect the many cultures present in australia
8392207 some cosplayers choose to cosplay because they like the characters they see on tv and some are international students that cosplay as characters from manga or anime they used to watch in their country
8392208 its a kind of cobra this snake usually lives in african savannas often in trees
8392209 ive had a chance to play and be healthy so im excited to be here
8392210 im motivated to do very well here and for the rest of the season
8392211 i dont want to fight i dont want to shout
8392212 i wish i could play normal matches and enjoy tennis sometimes
8392213 i think the current situation is the closest in this past decade our party has come to winning control of the government
8392214 it is unfortunate that no one has stood up to run against mr ozawa
8392215 a lower house election will happen within a year at the outside but it could happen by the end of this year given the situation i think it would be good to have vigorous debates about policy and diet session plans during the partys presidential election
8392216 but obviously there are people who have a different opinion
8392217 i have said that i wont be running for election mainly because i resigned the presidency due to the e mail scandal
8392218 the springboks will get worse if they continue in this way
8392219 no one in world rugby is playing the way their coach is talking about not successfully anyway everyone has discipline policies and a procedure in their game the way he is talking is nonsense you cant just play an expansive wide game
8392220 he has to change his philosophy because it doesnt fit these players its not credible you have got to give players a framework to work under
8392221 south africa are attacking off everything and theyre going lateral not through defenses you have to go through sides like australia and new zealand first south africas problem is if you have played one game then try to go to the other extreme thats a danger knowing the south african players i would say they would prefer much more discipline theres no structure in their game at present and they have lost all their discipline
8392222 this is still a very good squad of players most are even at their peak or approaching it so there is plenty of talent but what they need is the organization and discipline
8392223 if de villiers keeps on going down this track he will be unsuccessful he has got to learn if he wants to coach at international level you have to have some sort of discipline involved then get the players to play for that the hard thing for peter is that he has never coached professionally and this is one of the most difficult teams to coach
8392224 we did not defend properly on two occasions and it completely changed the face of the game
8392225 akinfenwa is a big strong lad and at times we did not handle him well enough
8392226 it was difficult to motivate the team after the comprehensive victory at home artmedia confirmed its quality and deserved to draw
8392227 i consider the 1 1 draw with juventus a success
8392228 rather now may be the opportune moment for japanese enterprises to catch up with their american european and asian competitors operating in india
8392229 japan will most likely overtake the united states and britain in 2008 as a leading foreign investor in india
8392230 rather than foreign investors setting up joint ventures with local partners in india it is advisable to establish a 100 percent subsidiary by hiring top managers from the local human resources market who are well versed in the local business practices the bureaucracy tax and other legal systems and who have local business networks
8392231 the possibility of japanese nationals being targeted for kidnapping cannot be denied as the media has reported that the talibans spokesman said it would continue to abduct foreign nationals exceptional caution is required
8392232 the late goal was a happy circumstance but i am not happy with the result
8392233 i was hoping it would come but we must score earlier we were too hectic today
8392234 we have not enough goals from our strikers this season
8392235 i think even now they are not aware of the situation that teams play defensively against us they have to keep the ball and play it back or go 100 percent for the goal we have 2 1 2 weeks off now and that is what we will work on
8392236 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8392237 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8392238 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8392239 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8392240 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8392241 i am very sorry for causing trouble to the team and worry to the fans due to the injury i will concentrate on treatment for now and make efforts so that i can come back as soon as possible
8392242 when i got that hit to left field that guy started saying all kinds of stuff
8392243 hey i hit the ball hard i had no chance to make it to second
8392244 well keep doing it until we find the right way
8392245 i think the whole ballpark knew he wasnt going to swing but he put on a good show
8392246 trace elements spirit and memory in japanese and australian photomedia
8392247 it takes time for artists and curators to get to know each other and understand the artistic practice of each country even now i couldnt claim to understand everything about australia
8392248 even though we understand that photos of this kind are not necessarily representing the truth
8392249 there is still a part of us that takes imagery as an accurate record of past events
8392250 a chemical element that is needed in minute quantities for the proper growth development and physiology of an organism
8392251 trace elements spirit and memory in japanese and australian photomedia
8392252 i dont think i have a concept of this is japan
8392253 he says as we chat in the lobby of the jts tokyo building
8392254 if i did that i think the cd would be all over the place the first thing is that its got to be an enjoyable listen so you put on track one and listen till track 19 and it all somehow fits together
8392255 world music network is a world music label in other countries world music is a living thing a growing thing so i tried to find what i think is representative of that in japan and i think the main type of music is minyo folk music in the sense of irish folk as opposed to bob dylan folk so a lot of the instruments have that minyo feel to them the main instrument is the shamisen and the first four tracks on the cd are all based on minyo
8392256 you know as a journalist i would interview some artists for a magazine in britain and the magazine gets published and then people want to buy the cd but theres nowhere to buy it so ill sell it to them and then some festival guy hears this band and asks can they play at my festival so ill find out oh yes they can but theyve never been abroad before so ill go with them and now im a tour manager as well everything grew in a very organic kind of way
8392257 i was also writing a column for the japan times and doing quite a lot of consultancy work for records labels and touring with artists
8392258 one artist who ended up on both these cds is the okinawan musician takashi hirayasu i went around the world with him to canada africa europe and when festivals have some particular theme of japan i might program the whole festival
8392259 when you license the songs from the record companies theres a term involved when it finishes you can either license the tracks again or do a new one so thats what we did its like the rough guide travel books in a way you can keep updating them but eventually theyll become out of date so you have to do a new one
8392260 the music is not traditional in the strict sense traditional japanese music is quite preserved its taught from a master to a disciple whereas a lot of the musicians on this cd and the last cd are kind of outsiders they might be technically pretty good and some of them have studied but they have a strong personality and try to do something creative on their own theyve updated the tradition in their minds theyre keeping it alive
8392261 thats another side of japan people dont know much about the ainu
8392262 also for the first time theres an enka track on here by harumi miyako
8392263 ive started to like enka since moving back to england
8392264 in some ways it was quite easy to live in japan
8392265 generally youre treated really well i could work i could have holidays pretty much as i wanted and theres great traveling in other parts of asia i had a lot of friends i was quite immersed in a japanese world but nevertheless i felt that no matter how many years id have been here i would always be a gaijin foreigner eventually for me it gets a bit tiring its easy to live here but it some ways its not total reality it was much more of a challenge for me to go back to london and transfer my business there
8392266 another countrys music always seems more appealing especially when youre young especially when youre looking for traditional or folk music its quite common to reject your own traditional music but maybe get into it when youre a little bit older young people dont usually get to listen to it because its not in the mainstream so one of the things i was quite pleased about with the first rough guide to the music of japan cd and also the rough guide to okinawa is that young people found that their own local roots music isnt quite as uncool as theyd thought
8392267 ive been doing this for a long time and im used to the reaction of people not knowing and because i am or was a foreigner living in japan im treated slightly differently at the time of the first one it was very unusual in japan to put tracks by different record companies on the same cd people were quite reticent to do that they think the next company is their rival its sad but i think its true so i can cut through the formalities the distances and relationships that might exist between japanese people by being a foreigner i can do it because i suppose they think i dont know any better
8392268 the only people who get really upset are the academics
8392269 the china cd got a pretty violent reaction from them because it opened with cui jian the godfather of chinese rock n roll and had a punk song on it by bratty girl band hang on the box and on the thai one there was a real pop track by china dolls and that just upsets the purists but purisms not what im about and its not what rough guides is about and its not what musics about i just want people to enjoy it
8392270 osvaldo finds inspiration in a lot of places people dont think to look
8392271 crazy catholic festivals mixed up from spanish and italian processions but moving at a salsa rhythm there was a lot of rum and a lot of dancing
8392272 and on ayre goes veering precipitously from one emotional extreme to another
8392273 in a style that embraces post minimalist modernism cinematic tone painting musique concrete folk like sincerity and the brash beats of electronica
8392274 its like outkast who switch from broadway to hip hop to 70s pop to express what they want at each moment
8392275 thats what great classical composers did until the mid 20th century and thats what music should be doing now theres a huge language but ive never understood why we use too small a portion of it
8392276 theres a quiet vitality a carelessness of doing what feels good at the moment
8392277 i dont have pretentiousness that what i write will hang around i want my music to nourish the spirit for people right now
8392278 i wish we were today at a point where movies are
8392279 where you can do something really weird and everyone knows what youre doing where the creators speak the same language as the audience there are a lot of composers who miss the larger tide of our culture i want to write music that connects
8392280 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8392281 i want you to know that this has been a joy yes we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time
8392282 if she can get up there and put everything aside and say shes supporting barack obama with her whole heart then its up to us to do the same thing
8392283 i dont see any further reason to continue to carry out a pretense that shes a candidate shes not
8392284 if we dont have an official roll call vote state by state it is going to reopen a wound
8392285 i think it is reflective of the unity that i sense that is building across the party
8392286 that doesnt mean there wont be outliers that are still heartbroken their favorite candidate didnt make it
8392287 going to be able to bring themselves to vote for anybody other than senator clinton
8392288 even though hillary tells us not to spend any time thinking about what might have been
8392289 im sure all of us were thinking about what might have been last night
8392290 if shes not a strong enough leader to get her followers to do whats right for america then that would surprise me
8392291 i think they are going to follow her lead and her lead was very crystal clear last night
8392292 if nato suddenly takes military actions against abkhazia and south ossetia acting solely in support of tbilisi this will mean a declaration of war on russia
8392293 we are close to a serious conflict u s and nato preparations on a strategic scale are ongoing in the operation the west conducted on georgian soil against russia south ossetians were the victims or hostages of it we can see a rehearsal for an attack on iran
8392294 these missiles are close to our borders and constitute a threat to us
8392295 this will create additional tension and we will have to respond to it in some way naturally using military means
8392296 in light of the build up of nato naval forces in the black sea our fleet has also taken on the task of monitoring their activities
8392297 can nato indefinitely build up its forces and means there it turns out it cannot
8392298 if i leave georgia the russians will close our airspace and prevent me from returning home
8392299 youre lucky i didnt knock the f k out of you
8392300 acc on new mexicos fingerprints are all over new mexicos business community and have enabled many hard working people to realize their business dreams
8392301 i like using butter and sugar and ahaing a lot of flavor
8392302 i try hard to keep things as far as that goes very low in fat
8392303 we prefer to focus on our own initiatives to enhance diversity and inclusiveness in our workplace
8392304 with all leagues on any given cycle it can turn out that way or it can turn out that a disproportionate percentage were coaches of color that were hired
8392305 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8392306 i knew there was a possibility so it wasnt a complete shock when i got called in and was told i would be scratched from the lineup due to precautionary reasons the club was in discussions for possibly moving me
8392307 if thats the case if im moved to a club that has postseason possibilities you cant be disappointed as a player
8392308 ive had a lot of fun here and ive been happy with bobby cox and the organization
8392309 while running alone through the siberian forests it was quite beautiful with the shapes of the wolves following alongside the track it got to 62 degrees below on some nights which made it tricky to melt my drinking water
8392310 we wanted to give the mustang pony a more realistic feel
8392311 we lifted the head to make the pony more proud tipped the neck into the wind to give it a feeling of greater speed and better balance
8392312 its more chiseled and more defined and looks more like a wild horse
8392313 its more realistic in terms of proportion to an actual mustang
8392314 if a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it
8392315 if a podcast is created but no one downloads it does it really exist
8392316 supermans success starts with us not the suits you have the power
8392317 people are interested in comic book movies because they represent mythology and adventure heroes they allow fantasies to exist in our world that worked with a great movie like dark knight which took it over the top you look at iron man and you have the same thing a serious actor like robert downey jr in a serious portrayal of a guy and then you have this cool fantasy aspect that makes for a great time at the movies thats what comic books allow us to do they live in our world but they also allow us to experience some sort of mythological connection to gods or whatever you want to call them and thats archetypal and everyone can relate to it
8392318 warner olands the only actor who can play charlie chan without him they should drop the series ill never see a sidney toler charlie chan movie
8392319 my mom is very level headed and she knows i drink she is very realistic
8392320 whether we agree with or want to hear something that she has to say typically since mother occupies such an important role in our lives we are going to recall things that she communicates strongly and clearly to us
8392321 what bounces around in my head when i go to parties use your head and have a dd all the time designated driver all the time thats the most important thing
8392322 my sons are scared and youre nervous and you want to fit in and hopefully theyll come home and talk about it and i know kyle was worried about getting beaten up and thats the first time hes mentioned that
8392323 as it gets closer it gets more it hits me more that its that close
8392324 everyones saying about how its going to be twice as much as middle school
8392325 and if youre in with people you dont really know youre afraid youll make a mistake and thatll ruin you
8392326 i hear a lot of headaches and stomach aches this time of year because they are so anxious about going to school
8392327 were actually doing a pre reading book report and right now its taking a while cause its summer and my brains off
8392328 to tell them that this is going to be short lived
8392329 this is going to be somewhat painful but its something you adjust to pretty quickly
8392330 in a big school its even more important because you really can feel lost in the crowd
8392331 to tell them first of all that all kids feel that way even the kid that you look at as the most successful attractive kid is probably feeling that way
8392332 you have to keep things in perspective academics are only a part of your life
8392333 some day when he hits that roadblock is he gonna be able to accept it or is it gonna be something you know that really bothers him a lot
8392334 the problem is that they will always be anxious they will always fail even when they have a 4 point average they will always fail in their own eyes and they cant ever relax
8392335 academics are only a part of your life and they should only stay a part of it and not become your whole life
8392336 perfectionistic kids get caught in a vicious cycle when approaching a task or project they feel less able to succeed get anxious and then evaluate their performance more negatively than their non perfectionistic peers
8392337 have i set up impossible expectations for myself in this situation
8392338 of what am i afraid what is the worst thing that could happen
8392339 i kept trying to figure out ways to become better friends with them like ways to fix myself so i could be better like i wasnt good enough but then any time i changed anything i changed my clothes i learned that it wasnt about my clothes because no matter what i did it was not good enough
8392340 all day from morning till the end from 8 oclock until 3 oclock
8392341 i sometimes had to lie to mom and tell her i was sick so i wouldnt have to go to school
8392342 we have a whole building full of kids who feel unsafe emotionally unsafe
8392343 if youre in drama instead of football youre gay if you like literature over gym class youre gay if youre academic instead of athletic youre gay
8392344 i didnt really want to break down in front of them cause i didnt want them to know i was hurting
8392345 so if you walk into the school building with a belief system that says i dont deserve to be taken care of im probably not going to make friends people arent going to like me then guess what youre probably going to attract that kind of thing
8392346 i would say just to make sure your child knows that youre there to listen and youll just hear what they have to say and hug them and love them and see if thats cure enough
8392347 once he was so scared to go to school that mom had to get out of the carpool line and walk him in
8392348 he jumped out of the car and jumped back in and cried and ran to the back of the mini van
8392349 im a little bit happy and im a little bit nervous
8392350 well its really just fear of the unknown at that age
8392351 there may be some fear sometimes of just not having a security person a parent or a sibling nearby that they can count on
8392352 if youre uptight about it if youre worried about it clearly your children will pick up on it and that will escalate their anxiety and fear
8392353 its just that in the morning when he separates from mom thats a moment of going from total safeness to a little bit of an unknown and thats just a hard thing to do
8392354 got a little picture of my mom and dad in my pocket
8392355 what the hells the matter with you people down there dont yall take your football seriously
8392356 this psychiatry s t apparently what youre feeling is not what youre feeling and what youre not feeling is your real agenda
8392357 estamos trabajando duro no s lo para conseguir el apoyo de la comunidad latina sino para garantizar que lo m s importante para ella est al frente de nuestra campa a y en nuestros corazones

8392360 we were secure in that level of force in that particular circumstance and confident that no charges would be brought against the officers
8392361 fine but no needles anything you can give with a needle you can give me with a nasal drip or pill
8392362 this is not something we threw together but is something we spent a lot of time on now well go forward and present it to the community with a positive attitude about it
8392363 if the 75 million one passes it has the arena
8392364 if only the 50 million passes they do it all except the arena the first one includes the arena the second one does not
8392365 in the event proposition one passes proposition two will have no effect
8392366 weve been able to come a long way in a short amount of time
8392367 that identified the needs of brazoria county and we were able to put those pieces together
8392368 it will be up to them to get the word out to the community so the folks understand exactly what the bond proposal consists of
8392369 weve got an election going anyway so its on the ballot for the voters to decide
8392370 naismith delivered to us the package we asked them to prepare and now the election has been called
8392371 its entirely in the hands of the voters of brazoria county well find out what they do or dont want us to do
8392372 you have 5 million people within a one hour driving distance and can market to them
8392373 you would not only be meeting the needs of brazoria county but you have the ability to market to a much larger area
8392374 we have confidence in the engineers work but the biggest question we have is what this will cost to operate each year we need to delve into that further
8392375 we dont typically see this type of facility as a moneymaker
8392376 its an awful lot of money and the public will need all the facts before they vote

8392389 this is your chance to own a piece of the city that is hosting the most memorable presidential extravaganza in history
8392390 this amazing dirt was hand selected in downtown denver just beneath a utility pole this is truly an unbelievable chance to have some democratic dirt
8392391 i bought this gas mask some time ago installed a new canister and never had any reason to use it such i dont know if it actually works but i dont see any reason why it wouldnt

8392395 every game is a big game but thursday is a big chance for us to showcase nationally what we certainly hope to be about as a football program
8392396 the biggest challenge without a doubt is i feel like when people havent had a lot of success a lot of times theyre scared of success we cant be a university thats scared of success
8392397 i like to walk down paths nobody else wants to
8392398 people are just throwing names and number out there before anything has happened
8392399 before you even play a down of football you feel like you should be handed a trophy
8392400 i think being on both ends of the spectrum has really helped us stay grounded we know that we cant let that stuff get to us

8392404 we were all kind of peeking up there to see what bill was doing

8392424 the contributors to the esv study bible represent the best of conservative biblical scholarship and solid and balanced theological positions these scholars hold to a very high view of the authority of scripture and are faithful interpreters i cannot think of a better group of contributing scholars for such a project the introductions overviews and study notes for each biblical book are immensely helpful to understanding the contents of these books the charts pictures and maps help visualize what happened where and when in addition the special introductory essays are outstanding and will help readers to understand such difficult topics as the formation of the old and new testament canon the reliability of the old and new testament manuscripts how to interpret the bible how to apply biblical truth and many more important topics related to christian faith the esv study bible is an almost bottomless treasure from which readers will find many gems i enthusiastically recommend it to students pastors and any christians who want to understand their bibles better

8392444 you go to wrigley field you have a beer beautiful people up there
8392445 people arent watching the game its not serious white sox thats baseball south side
8392446 i think most of the fans there are just there to enjoy the experience and uh drink beer i mean is that not true
8392447 i think we have great fans and they love baseball
8392448 but if you go to wrigley its kind of an experience i think a lot of our fans are tourists and theyre in town on summer vacation and they just want to check out wrigley
8392449 i think everyone knows hes a white sox fan but maybe he will lose votes who knows
8392450 am apelat la o firma de constructii pentru dezvoltare care are experienta in domeniu noi suntem doar investitori dupa ce am construit primele trei triplexuri pentru mine si inca doi prieteni am prins curaj si am hotarat sa derulez si aceasta investitie
8392451 conteaza foarte mult ce companie de constructii alegi atunci cand nu ai experienta eu am apelat la aceeasi companie care mi a construit si propria locuinta
8392452 cred ca aceasta idee ar trebui sa fie preluata si de alti tineri care isi cauta locuinte cu conditia sa isi aleaga cu grija constructorul

8392454 in aceasta perioada majoritatea companiilor isi vor reloca activitatea la aeroportul otopeni sau in functie de politica acestora isi vor anula unele curse
8392455 consider ca aeroportul va face fata unui numar suplimentat de zboruri deoarece am trait o experienta similara si anul trecut cand companiile aeriene s au mutat de pe baneasa pe otopeni intarzieri speram sa fie cat mai putine iar in cazul in care se vor inregistra nu vor fi cauzate de catre aeroportul otopeni

8392460 este greu de spus cum se vor imparti peste 2 3 ani bugetele de publicitate 2009 e un an de cotitura piata s a fragmentat foarte mult si nu poate sustine toti playerii din acest moment vom vedea ce va fi la anul daca piata se va coagula in jurul marilor publisheri sau in jurul regiilor
8392461 2010 este anul in care credem ca veniturilor publisherilor care se reprezinta singuri pe piata de publicitate online le vor depasi pe cele a regiilor este un fenomen care s a repetat in fiecare tara din europa centrala si de est din momentul in care valoarea pietei a depasit un anumit nivel critic care a permis atragerea de investitii suplimentare
8392462 atat in 2009 cat si in 2019 ne vom reprezenta singuri pe piata de publicitate online
8392463 unii publisheri isi vor crea departamente de vanzari dupa care vor constata ca aceasta solutie versus externalizarea catre o regie nu este categoric mai buna ci are atat avantaje si dezavantaje asa ca ulterior e posibil sa isi reconsidere pozitia
8392464 din punctul meu de vedere o buna parte din publisherii actuali vor fi reprezentati de regii regiile probabil vor trebui sa se repozitioneze si in consecinta isi vor pastra ponderea de peste 60 din piata
8392465 la fel ca si regiile si publisherii vor trebui sa se reinventeze pentru a face fata noilor conditii de piata pentru ca este greu sa concurezi o companie care face publishing de 10 ani in romania in timp ce faci doar content pe web de 2 ani
8392466 probabil publisherii offline traditionali vor incepe sa si vanda singuri si editiile online
8392467 pentru 2009 vad o piata a publicitatii online de 25 mil euro estimarea se bazeaza pe cresterea numarului de utilizatori ai internetului
8392468 cresterea numarului de utilizatori crestera consumului de media online in general dar si instrumentele de masurare din ce in ce mai complexe in special sati vor duce la cresterea acestei piete cu 70 80 in 2008

8392512 despite being amongst the lowest contributors to factors causing climate change the region is one of the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change including its exacerbation of climate variability sea level rise and extreme weather events
8392513 that despite pacific island countries low greenhouse gas emissions they are taking significant steps towards reducing their reliance on fossil fuel with its detrimental economic and environmental consequences
8392514 that climate change is a long term international challenge requiring a resolute and concerted international effort and stressing the need for urgent action by the worlds major greenhouse gas emitting countries to set targets and make commitments to significantly reduce their emissions and to support the most vulnerable countries to adapt to and address the impacts of climate change
8392515 to continue to develop pacific tailored approaches to combating climate change consistent with their ability to actively defend and protect their own regional environment with the appropriate support of the international community

8392603 energy security is fundamental to our existence as an independent democratic free state
8392604 i think the events not just in georgia but over a longer timescale have really confirmed the growing importance of energy independence for the uk
8392605 russia has huge energy resources and could be a really good partner for europe but its harder to do that when you see what is unfolding on the international stage
8392606 we must do as much as we can to get energy from indigenous sources britain needs more energy suppliers its harder to for us to have those energy relationships with countries that behave in the way russia has been doing lately
8392607 making a profit is better than making a loss and if we want these companies to invest significant resources investors are not going to do that if they dont think theres a reasonable return to be made on their investment
8392608 of course weve got to tackle climate change its a real and present danger for used but weve also got to be absolutely clear that our energy policy has got to be figured first and foremost with a view to supplying britain with affordable and secure energy it needs for the future
8392609 that is why we cannot turn our back on any proven form of technology we cannot afford to say no to new coal new gas or new nuclear

8392649 the traditional model for helping relatively depressed areas of the country is smokestack chasing where a city provides incentives to attract companies or to keep them from leaving
8392650 but the problem with that approach is that it is very expensive and it is a zero sum game from the point of the country as a whole because if i attract a company to my city then i win but the city where the company used to be from loses

8392730 hey kick matt in the nuts for me will you
8392731 i was exposed to cigarettes alcohol at a young age fourteen fifteen
8392732 i played my first club at fifteen so ive been around that scene a long time and smoking just always seemed like something that was me
8392733 i didnt start smoking until i turned eighteen my friends and i had this thing you turn eighteen you go out and buy a porn magazine and some cigarettes just because you can it was like a rite of passage you know i turned eighteen i went out and bought porn and cigarettes i threw away the porn
8392734 i was born in alexandria louisiana but we moved when i was real young lived in tulsa for about a year then moved here
8392735 me and a friend we were an acoustic duo we had one song and a bunch of covers and for a long time we played between old dime box sets you remember them
8392736 yeah so my friend and i would play between their sets our one song then a bunch of covers
8392737 its just a matter of teaching your hands what to do
8392738 but i was exposed to music at a very young age a lot of motown my mom had a bunch of motown records my dad played sax my mom played piano i inherited my dads sax at nine or ten but when i picked up the guitar i said fuck everything else i knew thats what i wanted to play
8392739 im glad you enjoyed it we had so much fun really ive never had more fun playing a show we started planning that thing back in december
8392740 yeah and a lot of other great local musicians we had so much fun ive had so many people tell me how much fun they had im hoping you know that i can write music like that that twenty thirty years from now still connects with people
8392741 i mean there can definitely be an art and science to writing music but for me writings a very personal process it usually happens quickly and often randomly but its personal its something that comes to me and ill sit down and usually have it written in fifteen minutes or so
8392742 yeah its usually fast that doesnt mean the songs finished i get feedback you know and ill play with it a bit
8392743 phil hell take one of my songs take it apart put it back together hell say your songs great but this is how this person might have done it or have you thought about this benjamin del shreve
8392744 is my favorite musician hes an incredible writer and musician so ive learned from him too and i really think bens responsible for bringing people back out to hear live music here on dickson you know dickson isnt what it was five years ago we had some great bands and then a lot of them left and daves closed and chesters closed and everybody started going to stir every night of the week and the music scene just kind of drifted there for a bit but ben and those guys helped bring people back out the guys at gypsy and now froggys they worked hard to sort of fill that void when daves and chesters closed and now weve got a lot of great bands out there and youve got brian crowne at georges whos really worked to bring in genuinely good stuff you go to georges now any night of the week and the place might not be packed but youre going to hear a quality band

8392747 but ask me in ten years maybe then ill be more into the idea of a family ill always want to be involved in music but maybe ill reach a point where i just want to go to the studio during the day so i can go home to a family in the evening live a normal life
8392748 every musician has an ego everybody wants to sell out madison square garden or whatever but i personally dont need that to feel successful or be happy id love to do it dont get me wrong but as long im doing what i love im fine ive always said as long ive got bread and turkey in the fridge im doing good im set of course ask me in ten years maybe ill be fucking sick of bread and turkey

8392840 lemeita was our only all conference player in the mountain west and calli was a phenomenal defensive player
8392841 but i think katelyn blackwood and our freshman sarah joeckel can come in and fill those shoes well with communication and by stepping in
8392842 both players have a way to go but they are definitely filling that void
8392843 i am trying to help all of the freshmen get acquainted with the way we run games here and with college volleyball in general
8392844 there isnt just one match that is going to be a pivotal turning point
8392845 every match and every set is going to be extremely important to this team
8392846 with seven freshmen and seven returners we have a lot of maturity and a lot of young athletes
8392847 they mix together really well we are going to have to see how the chips fall
8392848 i have been involved with usa volleyball for over 10 years and you are always evaluated whether through try outs or what you have done with the program
8392849 they basically picked coaches that have been through the pipeline
8392850 sort of like how the kids run through the pipeline of usa volleyball the coaches are put through a pipeline for usa volleyball too
8392851 there is the junior national team junior a2 team the youth national team and the youth a2 team
8392852 it is like a minor league for the national team that you saw in the olympics
8392853 fifty of the top kids in the country come and play on the youth a2 team and we split them up into different teams
8392854 this is the first year the youth group was competing they were young this year but next year they will stay together and have this year of experience
8392855 international play is very physical and its not as technical as you would think but there are a lot of game strategies that you are trying to imply into the game you are trying to turn the kids into more well rounded players
8392856 its more about strategy learning different blocking schemes how we are going to be more efficient on offense and defense
8392857 those are things we are able to apply to tcu that i can take from team usa volleyball
8392858 i think it is important to have one of my coaches there to see all of the young talent
8392859 of course not all of the best players are there because they opt not to go but its just another way for my coaches to be out there
8392860 some coaches want their other coaches to do it and other coaches do not because of the time they need them in the office

8392904 thats the sign of a good team one that can win in different ways
8392905 weve been able to win the last couple of weeks by sitting back and swinging the bat today we werent swinging the bats very well so we were able to play a little bit different game and it ended up working out for us
8392906 youve got to make sure to take same approach every pitch every at bat every game and not let the mental errors and mental mistakes get to you
8392907 that says a lot for this team how good we feel were going and how good we can be and how were not going to let up until the season is over
8392908 it stayed in and everything was good and i got an rbi once again weve got to do the little things

8392919 the decisions that are made by politicians are going to affect us as younger people
8392920 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8392921 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8392922 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8392923 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8392924 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8392962 soldiers usually take deployment money and spend it on themselves i was surprised by how much money came out of his pocket
8392963 i figured if people saw me giving back it would encourage them to do the same
8392964 when they see a soldier trying to give back when they are already selflessly serving their country they want to be a part of it as well
8392965 to know that you can make a profound difference in someones life is a wonderful feeling

8392995 i doubt if anyone of any tenderness or imagination can see the hand of a child and not be a little frightened of it it is awful to think of the essential human energy moving so tiny a thing it is like imagining that human nature could live in the wing of a butterfly or the leaf of a tree when we look upon lives so human and yet so small we feel the same kind of obligation to these creatures that god might feel
8392996 what happened yesterday at 1 25 p m edt was that during a normal daily software load something was corrupted in a file and that brought the system down in atlanta

8392998 it was far more than that 125 percent because airlines were refiling their flight plans manually they just kept hitting the enter button so the queues immediately became huge

8393018 truly wondrous appraising it now i feel a bit like bernard berenson standing before michelangelos temptation quaffing rare draughts of unadulterated energy and iching to get his cultivated meathooks on the heroic buttocks of eve though in truth due to its humility and patience its less a michelangelo than a renoir the roundess the warmth the rosy delight the joie de vivre the casual eroticism the full and robust charm it is at once a dramatically overflowing embodiment of the life force and an honest monument to the occasional genius of the plebeian palate

8393046 the developing world is poorer than we thought but no less successful in the fight against poverty
8393047 the new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurement because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries
8393048 data from household surveys have also improved in terms of country coverage data access and timeliness
8393049 the new data confirm that the world will likely reach the first millennium development goal of halving the 1990 level of poverty by 2015 and that poverty has fallen by about one percentage point a year since 1981
8393050 however the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
8393051 im too young to remember but i thought the words said about him today were very touching
8393052 few will have the greatness to bend history but each of us can work to change a small portion of the events and in the total of all these acts will be written the history of this generation
8393053 each time a person stands up for an ideal or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out against injustice he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance

8393064 i bet everyone at msnbc has independent on their voting cards oh were down the middle now
8393065 everyone is working hard here and people are passionate about their feelings and this is the rough and tumble world of politics
8393066 but it wasnt the first time and probably wont be the last the main thing is this does not define us dont make more of this than it is
8393067 we as a network do not have a point of view
8393068 so people on staff like scarborough whos politically in the other direction are made unhappy
8393069 the ground is shifting under his feet and hes trying to keep his footing
8393070 people like scarborough feel out of place and dont know what to do and so lash out
8393071 hes one of our main guys but we dont think its a season ending injury
8393072 the time frame it fluctuates but hopefully with his youth and hes been pretty durable and resilient to injury hopefully he does get back soon
8393073 with the off season moves we made hopefully we can still play at a high level this year to me its more something that you look at as a challenge and you dont let it defeat you you deal with it
8393074 training camp was going to be an important part of his development
8393075 thats going to be postponed obviously but hes got a lot of development on and off the court that hes going to continue to do ive got a lot of confidence in him and now his job is to get healthy
8393076 just in talking to nellie today were talking about maybe spreading that ball around and getting scoring from different areas

8393087 i grew up following reggie bush and usc for football
8393088 ive always liked stanford baseball it seems like they always have a strong team
8393089 i want to focus on our team right now and on winning and not really on recruiting i may take a visit or two during the season but thats it
8393090 i just loved the way he played and how much excitement he brought to the game
8393091 it seems like they always have a strong team that does well
8393092 all the coaches know that and they are okay with it
8393093 its really the best of the best there and i feel like i did well i thought i was pretty competitive and overall the camp was very productive
8393094 they dont take losing well and always strive to go 12 0
8393095 stanford is getting better and they beat usc last year and i know sc will want to prove something i think itll be an extremely exciting game and could go down to the end again
8393096 stanford has proven they are capable of winning big game
8393097 the whole tradition at notre dame and what theyve done there is great
8393098 i think coach charlie weis has definitely learned from their mistakes last year and i think theyll be on the uprise hes a great coach and i think theyll have a pretty good season
8393099 i got the offer from the old staff but they did tell me i still had the offer but they havent really been recruiting me

8393108 can you imagine a life so lost in benefiting others that your personal needs and wants dont play a big role in your thoughts love after all means action directed toward the benefits of others its unnatural to achieve this state most of us are self conscious instead for example i often have trouble getting into worship at public gatherings because i can focus only on what im doing and what i look like to those around me

8393113 the vp choice is very different and the media likes to make their predictions
8393114 no matter who mccain chooses its going to be a good choice
8393115 obviously this is the week that the democrats are going to get the bulk of the attention but were hoping that we can at least get a little time to share senator mccains perspective by way of rebuttal
8393116 its a great opportunity for minnesota to showcase our state and our people and our amenities and why this is such a wonderful state
8393117 but its a big undertaking and we want it to go well
8393118 the point of discussion we are at at the moment is examining the outcome of the referendum and obviously there will be a lot of meetings with eu colleagues between now and the end of the year so its not just a matter for our own personal consideration or national consideration it is a matter we have to discuss with colleagues as well

8393126 this award is msms opportunity to thank all military spouses for their invaluable contributions in addition to recognizing them for the challenges they overcome every day
8393127 the reason usaa exists is to help military families with their financial security and the peace of mind that brings especially to the military spouse who shoulders so much responsibility
8393128 i know i couldnt have done what i did for the army if my wife patty hadnt taken care of everything else
8393129 being the title sponsor of this award is a natural for us we feel honored to honor military spouses
8393130 the change in the al anbar province is real and perceptible
8393131 anbar remains a dangerous place but the ever growing ability of the iraqi security forces continues to move us closer to seeing iraqi control of the province
8393132 the force we needed in the anbar province in 2005 2006 to fight the insurgent at its height is not the force that we need there now to do nation building and to try to bring the government and the sunnis closer together
8393133 are doing a very good job of this nation building business
8393134 its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going someplace else in a much more expeditionary environment where the marine air ground task force really seems to have a true and enduring value then thats where we need to be
8393135 the taliban are growing bolder in their tactics and clearly doing their best to exploit security gaps where they exist
8393136 everyone seems to agree that additional forces are the ideal course of action for preventing a taliban comeback but just where theyre going to come from is still up for discussion
8393137 should our leadership determine that more u s forces are needed in the fight in afghanistan its no secret that the marine corps would be proud to be part of that undertaking
8393138 however in order to do more in afghanistan our marines have got to see relief elsewhere
8393139 he says it all the time jason doesnt like me
8393140 its not that i dont like him its just that im letting him figure it out hes got to figure it out first and once he does obviously thats where i come along
8393141 hes got a good position coach that pushes him obviously when hes ready for it ill definitely be able to talk to him and push his buttons but youve got to figure it out first and hes well on his way to doing that
8393142 i read all his books when i was a kid i read all his books
8393143 okay you stepped out in faith and now i am going to give you an inch of direction dont go that way
8393144 we threw branches and stones to drive him away but the dragon was crazed with blood and just wouldnt let go
8393145 det kan n v re greit ha mens du er her

8393149 were going to keep our commitments to afghanistan and iraq as we have pledged to do
8393150 for the sake of our freedom and security we must not relent until this enemy is destroyed
8393151 were gathering better intelligence because now the iraqis are less afraid to pass along tips about where enemy fighters are hiding and where they keep their weapons
8393152 is substantially degraded running out of sanctuaries losing the fight
8393153 has given iraqs elected leaders the breathing room to pass new reforms and theyve stepped up to their responsibilities
8393154 are able to lead more and more operations on their own
8393155 weve brought home all five of the combat brigades and the three marine units who were sent into iraq as part of the surge
8393156 further troop movements will as always depend on what is happening on the ground
8393157 ive had no greater privilege than the chance to work with members of the american armed forces
8393158 i believe that if anyone lacks for inspiration in the war on terror they need look no farther than the men and women who do the fighting
8393159 whether its on cold mountain peaks in afghanistan or the hot dusty streets of iraq they have been magnificent
8393160 and a new generation of warriors is the next chapter of american ingenuity bravery and valor
8393161 we have served those principles and sacrificed for them to the far corners of the earth
8393162 we have thrown back tyrants stood watch on the frontiers of freedom and defended the weak against the violent
8393163 weve done all this not for glory or empire but for freedom because we know that the spread of freedom makes our world safer and brings us closer to the peace we all desire
8393164 in the process weve received more than our share of criticism and we can take it
8393165 is a better place because of the power the influence and the values of the united states of america
8393166 blessed with the finest military any nation has ever fielded
8393167 and may we never take them or their families for granted
8393168 its been an honor and privilege to work for the oakland sheriffs department
8393169 they continue to be a tremendous support system to the individuals who are deployed around the world and their families
8393170 knowing that our families are taken care of at home allows us to more effectively focus on the mission at hand
8393171 i will always be in debt to the oakland sheriffs department and its employees for providing my family with the assistance they did while i was deployed

8393189 it was friday and i had just arrived home from work
8393190 when i retired i moved to enon ohio and lived just 1 5 miles from dan
8393191 were 15 months apart in age and were very close dans death is the worst thing that has ever happened to me or my family
8393192 i get up every morning and try to be productive
8393193 we do our best to smile and find some joy because ultimately thats what you have to do and thats what dan would have wanted us to do
8393194 i visit his grave often and try to live my life better
8393195 i try to be a better person husband father friend and brother
8393196 jim has always been active but never ran competitively like dan and i did
8393197 when we discussed running the marathon together he said charlie ill run it with you step for step from start to finish and he would have because thats how he was
8393198 i need to point out if i finish in less than five hours ill be very happy
8393199 dan didnt care how long it would have taken us even though he ran the marathon last year in three hours and seven minutes he only cared that we ran it together and finished together
8393200 in high school dan won districts and regionals and all that stuff
8393201 he began to run for the university of cincinnati but decided his studies in his chemistry major as well as rotc were enough so he just ran for pleasure he was a very good all around athlete even as a kid he was an all star in baseball and played peewee and junior high football and basketball
8393202 i knew my body would not be up to it much longer and this was something i always wanted to do with him
8393203 dan and i started running when we were 9 or 10 years old and he never gave it up this will probably be my first and last marathon because my knees are failing
8393204 i started running in grade school and have done so off and on ever since
8393205 ive become active again because of my desire to run the marathon
8393206 ive been mostly tracking the length of time i run as opposed to the distance
8393207 im averaging about 9 5 minutes per mile so im not setting any records
8393208 have you ever met somebody that made you feel very good about yourself and at the same time made you want to be a better person
8393209 he was not pretentious but he was thoughtful kind and patient
8393210 dan had tremendous leadership skills and was extremely intelligent he had a great sense of humor was sharp and was liked by everyone and although he was the youngest of nine children in many ways he was the leader of the family and provided the glue to keep us together

8393226 you mean the man who killed war and all the patrons of the arena that cid tep
8393227 oh man this is huge i mean did you hear what he had done
8393228 i was out of the city at the time with only the vaguest of details
8393229 oh man it was terrible i mean there was so many lost that day
8393230 so i hear but tell me son what did happen that day
8393231 griffith unleash your flame sacrifice these cattle and send their souls to zubaba the dark god of evil
8393232 cid why are you doing this these are your fans the people who supported you through the games why are you killing them
8393233 i dont give a shit about these fucks i only live to appease the will of zubaba now i will have your soul and that will bring him great pleasure
8393234 i dont want to hurt you but you leave me no choice cid tep prepare to face the wrath of war
8393235 your pathetic war but your soul will feed zubaba and make him full
8393236 you monster you murdered war my comrade in arms how could you do that
8393237 it was so easy i just took my blade and i cut his heart out what are you going to do about that
8393238 i have tried to make this world a utopia a place where every one can live in peace and harmony yet i cannot have you corrupting this world you killed war and now i have to stop you
8393239 thats one hell of a story i wonder how much of it is true though
8393240 your too young to remember the old world but back when you were still sucking on your mothers tit the world itself was a radically different place overcrowded and filled with anarchy the world was split into numerous nations each one with their own belief and hatred of one another wars were fought over things like oil and religion and ordinary good people were constantly caught in the crossfire i myself lost my son to one of these wars and for what oil land and power then came calypso and his horsemen they ran through the world subduing one nation after another taking their corrupt leaders to purgatory rock and mountain he created to imprison these bastards they are chained to the rocks and three tubes are placed in them one to hydrate them one to keep them nourished and one too keep them subdued they stay chained there for all eternity but eventually the vultures come for them too this day the skeletons of these dictators are still hanging on the rock it hasnt been used in years but trust me son when i say that it is a sight you will never forget
8393241 they are the funeral procession for war is set but i have too know why didnt you kill cid tep why send him to purgatory rock
8393242 because cid tep is the key to what i seek as the guardian he is the only being with a direct connection to what my brother once held

8393251 every year we have a number of students enrolling in a math or science class but have forgotten some mathematical topic a quick review is all they need however the class needs to be offered anytime of the year so students can access it whenever the need arises
8393252 after looking at the different options that allow students to do a quick review i chose mymathtest
8393253 first it assesses student needs and then recommends what must be studied then it gives ample practice until the student can master the concept i am very pleased with what mymathtest can do i think students will benefit enormously

8393471 acho que ela fez um discurso muito bom de seu ponto de vista e do nosso mas n o necessariamente do ponto de vista de barack obama
8393472 ela nunca respondeu realmente quest o essencial se ele obama est pronto para ser presidente que foi a quest o que ela lan ou de forma bastante dram tica durante as prim rias
8393473 a senadora hillary fez sua campanha presid ncia deixando claro que barack obama n o est preparado para liderar como comandante em chefe
8393474 em nenhum lugar esta noite ela alterou essa avalia o em nenhum lugar esta noite ela disse que barack obama est pronto para liderar milh es de eleitores de hillary clinton e milh es de americanos continuam preocupados sobre se barack obama est pronto para ser presidente
8393475 essa uma luta pelo futuro e uma luta que precisamos vencer
8393476 bom mas n o t o bom para barack obama em 2008 melhor ainda se as coisas mudarem como parecem para hillary clinton em 2012
8393477 o que faltou foi muito no sentido de uma descri o de barack obama que tipo de homem ele algu m que ap ia as mesmas posi es que ela
8393478 ser que ela olhou fundo em seu cora o e encontrou alguma coisa que valha a pena n o h sinal aqui de que ela tenha feito isso seria ele um bom comandante em chefe nenhuma palavra sobre isso como a campanha de mccain r pida e alegremente observou
8393479 a primeira vez desde 1976 que uma conven o ficava mais entusiasmada com um perdedor do que com um vencedor
8393480 cest une nouvelle fantastique il y avait beaucoup de rumeurs quant un ventuel d part de cadel vers une autre quipe mais je suis heureux de pouvoir nouveau compter sur lui jusquen 2010

8393484 there is nothing we do that is more important than community outreach and nobody has embodied that ideal more this season than dirk hayhurst

8393486 st phane dion is offering us the kind of politics that we say that we want
8393487 its still too early to tell exactly what its going to do

8393493 i voted for hillary this morning because i gave my word and i keep my word
8393494 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8393495 i dont see any further reason to continue to carry out a pretense that shes a candidate shes not
8393496 if we dont have an official roll call vote state by state it is going to reopen a wound
8393497 i think it is reflective of the unity that i sense that is building across the party
8393498 that doesnt mean there wont be outliers that are still heartbroken their favorite candidate didnt make it
8393499 going to be able to bring themselves to vote for anybody other than
8393500 even though hillary tells us not to spend any time thinking about what might have been
8393501 im sure all of us were thinking about what might have been last night
8393502 if shes not a strong enough leader to get her followers to do whats right for america then that would surprise me
8393503 i think they are going to follow her lead and her lead was very crystal clear last night
8393504 that question is on the minds of a lot of people
8393505 because it shouldnt take nine years and i assume six figures worth of costs to find out whether or not youve been libelled
8393506 public controversy can be a rough trade and the law needs to accommodate its requirements
8393507 it was really tough and i am completely out of breath

8393523 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything in her power to elect barack obama
8393524 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us
8393525 with eyes firmly fixed on the future and in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8393526 there is always something going on in the area we wanted to create an event that would not only compliment the area but also would be really different
8393527 one thing that jumped out at us was all of the white space we alys beach have available so why not have artwork projected on the walls of the town

8393538 the time for change has come and barack obama is the change we need
8393539 for eight years john mccain has fallen in line with every one of george bushs national security decisions and now he offers up four more years of the same failed policies barack obama has proven that he has the judgment to deliver the change we need

8393550 the implication is that people at risk of macular degeneration could help prevent the disease by consuming antioxidants
8393551 this work by dr vollmer snarr and colleagues ties these two damaging processes together and demonstrates the harm they cause in combination is much more than would be expected
8393552 this new knowledge suggests the possibility of interventions which could prove to be powerful ways to prevent or delay age related macular degeneration

8393557 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8393558 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8393559 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table

8393564 i dont know when the first one was but the station will have been in orbit for 10 years come november
8393565 if there is any good news at all its that the malware was designed to steal usernames and passwords from computer game players not something that orbiting astronauts are likely to be spending a lot of time doing
8393566 shes been around for decades and is not going to start making mistakes now her nomination would be a signal to american women that mccain takes their aspirations seriously even if obama does not
8393567 it gives the government a fresh mandate that will give the government another couple of years to proceed
8393568 i dont think harper has to be thinking about a majority at all
8393569 strategically this is sort of a prolonged war of attrition
8393570 you can fight a war with some objective less than total victory
8393571 would be enough to throw the liberals into turmoil and give harper a virtually free hand in parliament for quite a while and really handicap his main opponent
8393572 he doesnt like being at the mercy of others he likes to be in control of what hes doing
8393573 i suspect that theres some pretty strong or in depth party polls that are riding by riding that are persuading him that his chances are pretty good right now
8393574 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8393575 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8393576 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8393577 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8393578 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8393579 the us is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the dprk democratic peoples republic of korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
8393580 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
8393581 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program
8393582 it certainly is in violation of its commitments to the six party framework certainly in violation of the principle of action for action
8393583 this sudden move was not entirely unexpectable as the us has irked north korea by delaying the removal of north korea from the list of terrorism sponsoring states and south korea and the us did the joint military drill which was seen as a threat to the north
8393584 i do not believe that north korea whole heartedly said they will go back to the starting point in terms of denuclearization process i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the us to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible

8393626 for us its about trying to create pressure around that lineout and the two key guys are the thrower and the caller so if you can create pressure for them to operate under its going to be more difficult
8393627 their decision making becomes a lot less accurate and that doesnt necessarily just apply to south africa thats at any time
8393628 i just thought through the level of accuracy the guys were able to put into it they were able to create a pressure situation where guys who are very very good made errors and thats what youre aiming for every week
8393629 the guys did a particularly good job probably one of our better performances against south africa in the last couple of years theres no doubt

8393640 russia does not have in its possession any trustworthy data that supports the existence of nuclear weapons or any weapons of mass destruction in iraq and we have not received any such information from our partners as yet this fact has also been supported by the information sent by the cia to the us congress
8393641 there may be a difference of perspective about weapons of mass destruction there is one certain way to find out and that is to let the inspectors back in to do their job that is the key point on which we are both agreed
8393642 i f he if he didn t have any of them left why didn t he say so
8393643 now the rules of the road either mean something or they don t the international community says we re going to enforce the sanctions we placed or not

8393685 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8393686 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8393687 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8393688 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8393689 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

8393692 kalisa said something happened to joris and then she ran out of here
8393693 our first order of business is to find out what happened to joris if hes in trouble we have to go after him hells know the man cant take care of himself for five minutes
8393694 i dont suppose any of you can wave your arms and locate him
8393695 it probably would have helped if wed caught kalisa before she left
8393696 also that dwarf eldgrim he came by the shop looking for you
8393697 then id probably better go to twelve factols what do you need to go shopping for
8393698 but the spell doesnt always work perfectly i can try again tomorrow after i get some sleep
8393699 trying to find out where the portal to thazia is of course
8393700 if youd just tell me what i need to know
8393701 we can talk to tulio about thazia when hes feeling better
8393702 as for you mal was partly responsible for saving your ass it wouldnt kill you to offer him some tolerance and respect im going back to bed
8393703 well it looks like joris has been turned to stone and hes being transported somewhere by what seems to be a wizard
8393704 how well do you know the terrain in uh faerun all i can see are bleak rolling hills dotted with the occasional rocky outcrop one looks like a big face
8393705 that sounds a lot like the evermoors the face sounds like the old man its crawling with trolls or at least it was they were becoming a serious problem
8393706 it looks as though theyre heading toward the ruins of a big fortress
8393707 thats it lets go get lissy and see what she can do for us
8393708 do you want to come with us we have some armor and a morningstar you can use
8393709 i went to see eldgrim he just wants me to see if i can commission a suit of armor from one of the smiths at the clan where i grew up have you found joris yet
8393710 theyre big rubbery green humanoids that are always hungry i think theyre a type of giant actually
8393711 not at all i dont suppose any of you have seen jazra
8393712 she was at the temple of the abyss last night
8393713 visiting her sister i bet oh well it isnt the first time she didnt make it home im sure shes fine
8393714 she seemed fine when we saw her we do need to ask you for another favor though
8393715 we need to go back to faerun as close to the evermoors as possible joris got banished
8393716 lucky for you ive got just the thing theres a portal just up the street called the gate of the clueless its a special type of portal different keys will take you to different prime worlds if you have something with the arcane mark of a wizard from faerun for instance itll take you to a cave at the foot of the lost peaks
8393717 but as long as we have the correct key it wont accidentally dump us in the wrong place right
8393718 right you may want to hold the key out in front of you though so it doesnt open for something else youre carrying
8393719 do we have something with the arcane mark of a wizard from faerun though
8393720 thanks lissy you know we love you the most no matter what anyone else says
8393721 she just ate its rude to try and make her throw up
8393722 just up the street in the alley that runs behind the tenth pit
8393723 its kalisa well kalisa and someone else i dont know shes in disguise
8393724 this is sheen talan and haden and heres mal and
8393725 i believe ive even met the man but that was over a year ago
8393726 i was after a thief who fled here with a magical helm he pilfered from the temple of mystra i had no notion that hed acquired a prior acquaintance as statuary
8393727 i did not witness the act but such a thing is not unknown
8393728 i am certain his father will be pleased you should act quickly though ive only seen the three frost giants but when they spoke to the thief they intimated that more would be along shortly

8393731 lets get an actual universal plan in front of obama and get him to sign that
8393732 cant wait to watch sign a health care plan into law that covers every single american
8393733 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8393734 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8393735 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8393736 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8393737 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8393738 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8393739 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8393740 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8393741 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8393742 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8393743 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8393744 seems that if you dont go to court to fight the ticket or pay the fine they should come and get you to answer for your actions
8393745 i bet it the cameras can also put a location stamp where your vehicle is located along with the locater tool who ever thought a license plate was a bar code
8393746 paying a few cents per every 100 dollars of your homes value annually is a small price to pay for emergency services
8393747 im certain if your home is on fire you expect us to show up immediately with proper equipment and save everything we can
8393748 our fire department is extremely bloated for what they actually do on a daily basis and im sure the money will be spent on something more necessary

8393751 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8393752 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8393753 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8393754 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

8393768 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8393769 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8393770 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8393771 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

8393780 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8393781 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8393782 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8393783 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8393784 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8393785 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8393786 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8393787 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8393788 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8393789 who are open to doing something on the production side
8393790 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue

8393805 communism is power based upon force and limited to nothing by no kind of law and by absolutely no set rule
8393806 solicitor general ted olson has described the process there is no requirement for the executive branch to spell out its criteria for who qualifies as an illegal combatant
8393807 in other words what is safe to say today might imperil your freedom or your life tomorrow you can never know if you are on the right side of the law because the law is merely whim of the leader and his minions their instincts determine your guilt or innocence and these gut feelings can change from day to day this is now formally and officially the guiding principle of the united states government and underlying this edifice of tyranny is the prerogative of presidential murder
8393808 perhaps the enormity of this monstrous perversion of law and morality has kept it from being fully comprehended it sounds unbelievable to most people but that is our reality to overcome what seems to be widespread cognitive dissonance we need only examine the publicly available record there is nothing that any ordinary citizen could not know if they choose to know it
8393809 bush signed orders allowing cia assassins to kill targets without seeking presidential approval nor is it necessary any longer for the president to approve new names added to the target list the security organs can designate and kill as they see fit there is no way of knowing how many people have been killed by american agents operating outside judicial process most of the assassinations are carried out in secret quietly professionally the death squads are able to operate clandestinely using a full range of official and non official cover arrangements to enter countries surreptitiously
8393810 everything secret degenerates even the administration of justice nothing is safe that does not show it can bear discussion and publicity
8393811 the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them
8393812 god told me to strike at al qaeda and i struck at them and then he instructed me to strike at saddam which i did
8393813 since a human being has no power to create life he has therefore no right to destroy life
8393814 to force a man to pay for the violation of his own liberty is indeed adding insult to injury but that is exactly what the state does read the congressional record follow the proceedings of the state legislatures examine our statute books testing each act separately by the law of equal liberty you will find that a good nine tenths of existing legislation serves not to that fundamental social law but either to prescribe the individuals personal habits or worse to create and sustain commercial industrial financial and proprietary monopolies which deprive labor of a large part of the reward that it would receive in a true free market
8393815 buy the law makers buy the laws and you become the law itself that is the definition of corporate freedom
8393816 our electoral system is nothing less than a massive influence peddling scheme where both parties conspire to sell the country to the highest bidder
8393817 the senate is a brothel access is sold to special interests they write the bills and we vote for them
8393818 power is evil in itself regardless of who exercises it every dictator plans to rear feed and train his fellow men as the breeder does his cattle
8393819 we will not ask a white man who came to us recently for a piece of land that is already ours and has been ours since time immemorial
8393820 we want a right to live as we please as human beings we want a right to worship as we please and have our own land we dont want someone to plan our lives for us issue us rations social security or any other dole
8393821 self determination is sovereignty of self rule self determination means that a people have the sovereign right tom determine and carry out their own destiny without any authority to say whether their acts are good for them or not under self determination a people have the right to make their own mistakes and be accounted for them the us cannot give self determination to the hopi all it can do is get out of the way for the truth is the hopi want to run their own lives
8393822 the laws of the great spirit must be followed even though they might conflict with other political laws all instructions of the great spirit come from the seed of one basic instruction you must not kill you must love your neighbor as yourself from this one commandment to respect and revere life come all the other commandments to tell the truth to share with others to live together in mutual support to take care of our children and old people the sick and strangers friends and enemies to abstain from intoxicants and adultery not to cheat steal or covet
8393823 the law becomes the weapon of every kind of greed instead of checking crime the law itself is guilty of the evils it is supposed to punish
8393824 government is the only institution in our civilized society that is able to cover its coercion and use of threats of force in a shroud of mystique and legitimacy
8393825 few people would directly confront their neighbors with a demand of
8393826 the state is that great fiction by everyone tries to live at the expense of everyone else
8393827 to be governed is to be watched inspected spied upon directed law driven numbered regulated enrolled indoctrinated preached at controlled checked estimated valued censured commanded by creatures who have neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so emphasis added to be governed is to beat every operation at every transaction noted registered counted taxed stamped measured numbered assessed licensed authorized admonished prevented forbidden reformed corrected punished it is under pretext of public utility and in the name of the public interest to be placed under contribution drilled fleeced exploited monopolized extorted from squeezed hoaxed robbed and then at the slightest resistance the first word of complaint to be repressed fined vilified harassed hunted down abused clubbed disarmed bound choked imprisoned judged condemned deported sacrificed sold betrayed and to crown all mocked ridiculed derided outraged dishonored that is government that is its justice that is its morality
8393828 non cooperation with evil is as much our duty as is cooperation with the good
8393829 after michael was shot carly treated me badly and im not going to forget that
8393830 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8393831 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8393832 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8393833 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8393834 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8393835 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8393836 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8393837 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8393838 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8393839 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8393840 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8393841 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8393842 when one is alone and wet and cold and the distance between foot and cottage is not the distance feared one has thoughts some heavy like old iron others light as hummingbirds and still some like the wasp with a real wasp one can run or one can swat or if stung one knows a life was given in the act but when the wasp is inside and the sting within well one has thoughts best not shared
8393843 tell people that biology and the environment causes obesity and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid an excuse
8393844 as it is people who see more fat people around them may themselves be more likely to gain weight young people who think many of their friends binge drink are likely to do so themselves girls who think their peers engage in early sex are more likely to do so themselves peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour and they are classic excuses
8393845 our need and not just in relation to public health issues is to act on the environment while fostering positive peer pressure and social norms we have to take away the excuses

8394062 their decision making becomes a lot less accurate and that doesnt necessarily just apply to south africa thats at any time

8394210 ive been training since man since the beginning of the year ive been training for a while for this fight
8394211 its just been crazy its kind of disheartening at times

8394213 that on his feet is exactly where he wants to be
8394214 but i think that hes also going to try and switch things up and maybe try to take me down or even just put pressure on me to see if he can make me shoot for a takedown take a bad shot
8394215 it was good he was very cool and just laid back
8394216 theres a lot of respect there hes very confident in his skills hes where he wants to be but then at the same time hes not overlooking me hes not disrespecting in any kind of way so its just business as usual nothing personal

8394218 liddells a class act hes a great guy to begin with
8394219 to fight somebody whos an icon of the sport who has accomplished as much as has and to fight somebody who is or was where i want to be is a great honour

8394307 we believe that our business will flourish due to four important factors which include location our shopping centers are in prime locations strong management our team members have extensive commercial real estate experience innovation we offer our tenants innovative payment options and we are able to maximize lease payments and reduce our accounts receivable and land banking we intend to acquire additional popular and profitable land for future development
8394308 we have a solid development program for additional commercial spaces in taiyuan and we are optimistic that we will successfully acquire rights to a very valuable land bank these valuable development rights are unlikely to be duplicated in taiyuan as it is not possible to create more land
8394309 in addition management will continue our financially prudent practice of requiring prepaid rents from our commercial tenants for the entire term of the leases which is typically five to eight years this method allows for an expeditious return of capital to the company while greatly reducing debt service carried on the properties

8394337 the district courts decision i believe reflected an ideological bias that says in effect that if you give something away it isnt worth anything there is overwhelming evidence that collaborative open source endeavors are capable of creating wealth consider for example science in this decision the cafc declares its acceptance of this principle

8394343 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
8394344 most managers are taking the position that it would unthinkable to imagine a scenario where the government wouldnt back the debt

8394346 a diretoria da atp confirma que infelizmente recebeu uma peti o dos organizadores do torneio de bangalore para suspender o evento de 2008

8394354 speaks for itself with a voice that is haunting and demands our attention
8394355 we were fortunate enough to go to number one in australia and new zealand the united states and i wanna even say canada at the same time since then with the five weeks that the record has been out weve already gone gold in the u s canada and weve gone gold in australia and platinum in new zealand so were very very excited at the same time i think its a testament to our fans yknow our fans around the world they stick by us they support us and we really wouldnt be able to achieve the success that weve had without them
8394356 we definitely had some doubt because of the state of the industry yknow with downloading so prevalent and sales down worldwide roughly twenty percent each year its definitely a concern of ours but at the same time we felt that we stepped up and delivered the record that the industry was desperately needing
8394357 yknow i think everyone is trying to point the finger record labels are to blame and everyone else is to blame but i personally feel that its the artists that are to blame if the artists put out great music and they put out great records instead of records that had maybe one or two good singles on it and the rest of the record is totally filler then i think that would be a huge part of it i think people would be willing to buy a good quality record and i think that our fans prove that we pride ourselves on taking the time on every single note every single beat and making sure that there are no fillers on our records and our fans know it they appreciate it and they come out and they actually buy the records the sales have definitely reflected that yknow i dont want to sound conceited in any way but we know that our fans work hard for their money and we dont want to cheat them we wanna give them every penny worth
8394358 oh i download to check out the artist so i dont ger ripped off
8394359 i mean in the us cds are like 20 25 now for a single album if you have say 10 songs on it and only two are good youve wasted 80 of that money

8394361 principalmente daqui que n o h incentivo nem subs dios suficientes para o esporte o atleta chega ao evento todo o mundo est de olho nele e a m dia n o poupa coment rios cru is a press o se torna maior do que a que ele j aplica em si mesmo porque claro que ele quer ganhar quer dar o seu melhor
8394362 no v lei por exemplo voc n o consegue pular ou bater forte na bola se n o adquirir essas qualidades internamente a mente uma s n o d para isolar o trabalho do resto tudo reflete no nosso desempenho as empresas d o muito valor produtividade e tentam extrair dos funcion rios resultados lucros mas precisamos de equil brio para produzir acho que as pessoas est o buscando isso cada vez mais o problema que procuram o equil brio do lado de fora e n o internamente
8394363 devemos nos preocupar com nosso f sico e intelectual sem deixar de valorizar as quest es emocionais
8394364 equilibrar todos esses pontos fundamental para realizarmos qualquer tipo de atividade principalmente as relacionadas s reas profissionais e educacionais
8394365 essas caracter sticas permitem que o profissional domine seu ambiente e suas tarefas e consiga conciliar as press es corriqueiras de forma mais amena um profissional maduro emocionalmente e dotado de autocontrole consegue a proeza de n o permitir que problemas pessoais interfiram no seu trabalho supera situa es adversas de forma positiva e respeita a opini o dos seus pares

8394419 is the only one that features plastic maracas and a parade drum taken from an elks club in pontiac michigan
8394420 we are still on track the process has speeded up
8394421 we cannot come to a meaningful solution on climate change without coming to grips with deforestation
8394422 we may have something in poznan pretty close to a negotiating text
8394423 the talks here have made it clear that sectoral approaches are not about imposing targets sectoral approaches are something that a government may or may not choose to do on a national level
8394424 deeply concernd by the serious current impacts of and growing threat posed by climate change to the economic social cultural and environmental well being and security of pacific island countries and that current and anticipated changes in the pacific climate coupled with the regions vulnerability are expected to exacerbate existing challenges and lead to significant impacts on pacific countries environments their sustainable development and future survival
8394425 despite being amongst the lowest contributors to factors causing climate change the region is one of the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change including its exacerbation of climate variability sea level rise and extreme weather events
8394426 that despite pacific island countries low greenhouse gas emissions they are taking significant steps towards reducing their reliance on fossil fuel with its detrimental economic and environmental consequences
8394427 that climate change is a long term international challenge requiring a resolute and concerted international effort and stressing the need for urgent action by the worlds major greenhouse gas emitting countries to set targets and make commitments to significantly reduce their emissions and to support the most vulnerable countries to adapt to and address the impacts of climate change
8394428 to continue to develop pacific tailored approaches to combating climate change consistent with their ability to actively defend and protect their own regional environment with the appropriate support of the international community
8394429 continue to advocate and support the recognition in all international fora of the urgent social economic and security threats caused by the adverse impacts of climate change and sea level rise to our territorial integrity and continued existence as viable dynamic communities and of the potential for climate change to impact on intranational and international security
8394430 helping families approach pregnancy labor birth and parenting with confidence is important to us
8394431 it was cool because we found out he was a fan of the band
8394432 when we first met him he was chatting to me about stuff that wed done and he knew a lot about us which was really flattering as we were big fans of his obviously
8394433 it was just one of those things where it was like do you just wanna play some stuff and see how it goes just for fun and it was good
8394434 its this weird coincidence that he happens to live part of the time where i live and part of the time where my brothers live so its not bad really it works quite well
8394435 none of them are exactly finished because the idea was we were always practicing like lets finish these songs but we end up writing new ones so we never finishing them its more fun to write new stuff
8394436 johnny was saying when i used to see the ramones i used to be like its really cool but all of them should be singing so johnny was like i wanna have a mic i wanna do some backing vocals thats what i mean hes totally part of it its dead exciting it doesnt feel like a guest weve just got a new member
8394437 being one of millions with a close connection to cancer i know i need to do my part
8394438 i was bummed that i wasnt going to get to see rage i grew up in spain and i saw them a bunch of times in the 90s when i was a kid
8394439 they were a huge influence on me musically and politically they made people question things and made people talk about how f ed up america and europes foreign policy is theyre just a massively influential band on many different levels
8394440 i walked past tom morello at a festival in sweden but he was in the middle of a heated ping pong game
8394441 he seemed pretty into it but yeah i wanted to do the whole hi youre my hero but it just wasnt the moment
8394442 i dont know if theres going to be a second record
8394443 if anything performing has hindered my songwriting because im used to writing on my own pace at my leisure or while im supposed to be working a proper job i dont really have time to sit down when im not performing im usually really tired and just want to sleep
8394444 theyve lost the plot i dont get it anymore what theyre doing now i dont think is very good
8394445 it hurts because he is the man who stood for justice
8394446 the fact of the matter is zamoyski created these works and never assigned the copyright to anyone
8394447 by law the creator retains the copyright unless he assigns it
8394448 valid agreements for the transfer of rights which are signed by the artists former employer and thus believe that there is no validity to the allegations contained in the complaint
8394449 well i love you so much and its all i could do just to keep myself from telling you that i never felt so alone before
8394450 they want to know about my culture thats very satisfying to me twenty years ago this would not be possible twenty years ago italians tried to sing in english sing the blues maybe that was a good thing but you can be authentic when you realize your roots thats what b b king janis joplin aretha franklin did
8394451 i dont want to lose whats mine but i want to contaminate my roots
8394452 were so packed with connected things we are starving for peculiar things
8394453 a woman who marries a man only for the purpose of exploiting him she screamed raw and theatrically
8394454 and at another point her violinist accented a song by scratching the bow on the strings for what sounded almost like the tortured meowing of an anguished cat
8394455 im going to start a tour in september and october all in america new york boston chicago l a other places

8394457 stephen is blessed with an impeccable reputation in the creative community
8394458 he is a song man par excellence and a respected and accomplished musician and producer in his own right that strength has served him well as one of the most talented a amp r executives in the industry his abilities complement our growing team at island and mercury and we are extremely pleased to have him aboard
8394459 the era of cheap energy is over the question is how are we going to adjust to that and what sort of help can we provide to those who are going to struggle the most
8394460 there is genuine concern about the difficulties that people will face paying their heating bills over the coming winter and we are looking at extra support
8394461 what we shouldnt do is create a climate that makes it harder to attract new investment the new nuclear investment the new renewables investment the new investment in clean coal and gas
8394462 we need 100 billion plus in the next 10 years so weve got to create the right framework that encourages investment so we must not lose sight of that
8394463 and we shouldnt do anything that has the effect of putting up bills further
8394464 energy security is fundamental to our existence as an independent democratic free state
8394465 i think the events not just in georgia but over a longer timescale have really confirmed the growing importance of energy independence for the uk
8394466 russia has huge energy resources and could be a really good partner for europe but its harder to do that when you see what is unfolding on the international stage
8394467 we must do as much as we can to get energy from indigenous sources britain needs more energy suppliers its harder to for us to have those energy relationships with countries that behave in the way russia has been doing lately
8394468 making a profit is better than making a loss and if we want these companies to invest significant resources investors are not going to do that if they dont think theres a reasonable return to be made on their investment
8394469 of course weve got to tackle climate change its a real and present danger for used but weve also got to be absolutely clear that our energy policy has got to be figured first and foremost with a view to supplying britain with affordable and secure energy it needs for the future
8394470 that is why we cannot turn our back on any proven form of technology we cannot afford to say no to new coal new gas or new nuclear
8394471 the findings of this report demonstrate that maryland can and should take action now to reduce our global warming pollution
8394472 marylands greatest challenge is likely to be in adapting to climate change along its expansive coast as this is where the most significant economic and ecological impacts will occur
8394473 protecting coastal development from inundation beach erosion and salt water intrusion ill be costly and uncertain
8394474 however losses in eco tourism are likely to result as a 21 percent reduction in mid atlantic wetlands between now and 2100 hinders shorebird nesting and fish nurseries
8394475 we realize that times are tough for everyone in our community but we hope our citizens continue to support this great cause
8394476 donors should know that monies collected go to colorado families
8394477 the sale is a great business decision we are delighted we look forward to expanding the brand even further to chicago and tokyo
8394478 we are excited to be working with rec solar in providing clean energy during the convention
8394479 rec solars vision is to make solar electricity part of the mainstream energy supply to make that shift in paradigm a reality we recognize that we must reach out to the next generation of energy consumers in their preferred online medium

8394497 the engineer saluted him with a longer than usual toot of the trains whistle
8394498 he used to have a picnic at his house for the train crews
8394499 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8394500 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point were expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane
8394501 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8394502 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8394503 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8394504 i dont know how i can live now because none of my family is left
8394505 thats because other countries have smart stable forward looking energy policies
8394506 how can you not be happy with that on your foot

8394521 da tempo ludc aveva posto lattenzione sulle aree agricole e sul censimento delle stesse
8394522 e stata necessaria la violenza su i due turisti olandesi per capire che a roma sono centinaia le strutture ex agricole abbandonate e occupate da clandestini e da persone senza fissa dimora

8394549 e rimasto lo stesso uomo di cui mi innamorai 19 anni fa luomo che quando mi ha portato a casa dallospedale insieme alla nostra prima figlia guidava a passo di lumaca guardando con ansia nello specchietto retrovisore sentendo per intero il peso del nostro futuro nelle sue mani e deciso a dare alla nostra bimba tutto ci per cui aveva lottato e quello che lui non aveva mai avuto labbraccio rassicurante di un padre

8394572 to get selected i think ive got to show some form i havent become a bad player im just sort of out of form and have been for the last month
8394573 but i feel very much more confident having had a weeks holiday away from the game and after practising here last week
8394574 hopefully im past the stage of justifying my ryder cup potential or otherwise everybody here and im sure that i speak for the captain as well understands my love for the ryder cup and thats how i will be remembered if you like
8394575 theres no resignation in any way shape or form i just felt i wanted to turn my game around and the best way to do that was practise up here and prepare the way that i have
8394576 im still five short but we will see thats what i was doing yesterday trying to find launch angles and all kind of fancy technical stuff that ive never been into before
8394577 i played well last week and i need to do the same again this week
8394578 if that warrants me or merits me a pick then fantastic
8394579 most of us would have liked to see him trying to qualify

8394586 this market is a little bit tough and its fluctuating quite a bit so i think some of the lenders are going to be more conservative than they have been in the past
8394587 theyre very exact people these are spreadsheets and they can look at it and they can say you know what this has a chance or it doesnt ill rely on their expertise for that

8394617 he thinks hes as famous as jen now last week he went to a party tipped off the paps and even had decoy cars at the ready when he was leaving
8394618 nice but no one bothered to follow them which made john think he lost everyone when really it was because no one bothered to follow him
8394619 pictures of john and jen were selling for 20 000 at one point a picture of him alone gets 200 now chasing him from his apartment to a restaurant is hardly worth it
8394620 jennifer didnt see herself and john having much in common or having a future together she wasnt fazed by the ending of it she wasnt hurt at all she feels fine

8394646 non avevo mai sentito nulla di simile nemmeno per quel idiota di mia marito quando vidi i suoi occhi per la prima volta lo ricordo ancora rimasi senza fiato

8394649 no assolutamente stato il gesto pi bello che qualcuno abbia fatto per me rose non capisci mi ha aiutato a rivivere a dimenticare il dolore a essere veramente felice

8394652 il tempo passa anche quando sembra impossibile anche quando il rintocco di ogni secondo fa male come il sangue che pulsa nelle ferite passa in maniera disuguale tra strani scarti e bonacce prolungate ma passa perfino per me bella

8394655 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion

8394658 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8394659 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8394660 in this historic political year we will be bringing our unique independent perspective and analysis to the convention
8394661 our goal is to bring both conservative and alternative news perspective to our audience of more than 5 million readers through newsmax com our email news alerts magazine and through several online newsletters
8394662 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8394663 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8394664 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8394665 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8394666 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8394667 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8394668 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8394669 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8394670 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8394671 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8394672 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses

8394731 and we could make rescue boats out of egg boxes and put policemens in them
8394732 we could bake lots and lots and lots of cakes tomorrow and use up all those eggs we bought and then we could use the box for the rescue boats for the policemens

8394735 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8394736 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8394737 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8394738 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8394739 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8394740 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8394741 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8394742 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8394743 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8394744 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8394745 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8394746 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8394747 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8394748 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8394749 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8394750 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8394751 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8394752 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8394753 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8394754 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8394755 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8394756 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8394757 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8394758 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8394759 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8394760 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8394761 certo certo e ci che vuoi che io pensi e quando mi sveglie sar molto peggio se mi sveglier il che non avverr perch sono gi morta

8394777 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8394778 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8394779 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8394780 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8394781 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8394782 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8394783 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8394784 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8394785 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

8394787 he has a tremendous future with this franchise and we look forward to watching his continued development
8394788 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8394789 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8394790 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8394791 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8394792 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8394793 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8394794 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8394795 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8394796 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8394797 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8394798 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8394799 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8394800 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with

8394996 we have agreed that we have no ill feelings because of the past war the two kings will henceforth remain friends forever the relationship between maharajah gulab singh of kashmir and the lama guru of lhasa dalai lama is now established the maharajah sahib with god kunchok as his witness promises to recognise ancient boundaries which should be looked after by each side without resorting to warfare when the descendants of the early kings who fled from laddakh to tibet now return they will not be stopped by shri maharajah trade between laddakh and tibet will continue as usual tibetan government traders coming into laddakh will receive free transport and accommodations as before and the laddakhi envoy will in turn receive the same facilities in lhasa the laddakhis take an oath before god kunchok that they will not intrigue or create new troubles in tibetan territory we have agreed with god as witness that shri maharajah sahib and the lama guru of lhasa will live together as members of the same household
8394997 the king of laddakh reserves to himself the village of minsar in ngarees khor sum that he may be independent there and he sets aside its revenue for the purpose of meeting the expense involved in keeping up the sacrificial lights at kangree kailas and the holy lakes of mansarovar and rakas tal

8395209 partly because darcy has really matured as a candidate she has worked her guts out people respect that people understand that there is a real difference between darcy and dave reichert on a number of issues that they care about
8395210 the reality is the incumbent in that district has taken some votes to try to distinguish himself from president bush
8395211 but by and large his record is a whole lot more consistent with president bush than would be darcy burner
8395212 i think hes going to be very important to our state and the message that he is sending about the kind of change he wants to bring nationally is the kind of change weve made happen in our home state

8395214 we seriously doubt that contact with appellant would help her process the tragic events she has experienced

8395230 the ec is far behind schedule there should be time to study and clean the register i therefore think they should do some overtime
8395231 i wonder if the ec is being truthful to ghanaians i even doubt if the 2 500 work stations they promised was provided they keep saying they have no problem but i dare say they have problem with funding

8395234 they beat the shit out of him in front of a cop
8395235 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8395236 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8395237 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8395238 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8395239 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8395240 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8395241 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8395242 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8395243 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8395244 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8395245 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8395246 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8395247 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

8395259 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8395260 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8395261 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8395262 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8395263 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8395264 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8395265 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8395266 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8395267 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8395268 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8395269 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8395270 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8395271 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8395272 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8395273 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8395274 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8395275 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8395276 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8395277 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8395278 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8395279 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8395280 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8395281 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8395282 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8395283 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8395284 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8395285 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8395286 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8395287 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8395288 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8395289 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8395290 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8395291 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8395292 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8395293 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8395294 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8395295 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8395296 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8395297 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8395298 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8395299 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8395300 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8395301 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8395302 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8395303 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8395304 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8395305 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8395306 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8395307 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8395308 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8395309 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8395310 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8395311 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8395312 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8395313 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8395314 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8395315 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8395316 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8395317 have you tell me about it did you like it was it closed mouth
8395318 huh what if the green goblin had been a skrull all along
8395319 how can she celebrate when her sons have cancer also her sons are paying for her being so mean
8395320 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8395321 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8395322 so we have all of the projects ramped up now that the weather has calmed theyre all in full swing and guess what happens school starts we try to get these things done before school starts well it didnt happen that way this year we have about 10 public projects going on
8395323 just because you see work doesnt mean its the city
8395324 somebody sees a truck in the street and they think its the city
8395325 bluff street had an 80 year old gas line that was leaking and needed to be replaced
8395326 i think itll have bigger stores but its harder to get to
8395327 i dont get to go shopping as much at the mall of the bluffs because the stores are moving out there
8395328 well be talking and negotiating over the next few days and i expect the picture to be clearer by the end of next week the next few weeks are going to be hard as we say goodbye to valued colleagues and good friends
8395329 the sun times continues to manage through the unprecedented newspaper economic downturn
8395330 while our circulation in context continues to be acceptable advertising revenues are awful so again we are left with no choice but to cut our costs to try to match the reduced income
8395331 to state the obvious this is awful we are all anxious
8395332 we wish jay well and will miss him not personally of course but in the sense of noticing he is no longer here at least for a few days

8395340 first there was the rousing iron man now marvel entertainment brings the equally exhilarating the incredible hulk
8395341 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8395342 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8395343 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8395344 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8395345 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8395346 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8395347 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8395348 but honestly i cant imagine why graham wont just agree to debate him i mean hes only a powerful u s senator whose close friend is running for president of the united states and im sure conleys not a bad guy once you get past all the tinfoil
8395349 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8395350 we all need to be prepared and ready to respond from the citizen level and at every level of government
8395351 it just costs so much to raise a child nowadays
8395352 i was sewing tigers on my shirt and alligators you want to see the inside huh ill see you later here come the drama oh thats that nigga wit the fake blaow why you punch me in my face stay in ya place
8395353 i am friendly to audrina and dont feel like im getting the same in return
8395354 i think lc is going to figure out what my sister is like that shes not a trustworthy person
8395355 lauren and brody are always hanging out and we never know whats going to happen between them whenever theyre around each other those two really light up
8395356 hey wait a sec let me find that title in these boxes for you
8395357 to me that sounds like the first step on the road to demolition through neglect
8395358 hangar one is a bay area icon and significant historical landmark that needs to be saved
8395359 we applaud the navys decision to remediate the structure so that it no longer poses an environmental and health risk
8395360 patient safety is always our paramount concern and so we have immediately responded to the recommendation of the idmc we are currently notifying all participating clinical trial sites and regulatory agencies that enrollment of new patients into vital 2 has been suspended as has treatment with gvax immunotherapy for prostate cancer of patients enrolled in the study
8395361 notwithstanding this disappointing outcome we would like to acknowledge the courage and commitment of the patients and physicians who have participated in this trial
8395362 the observation in the vital 2 trial is very surprising to us and we have therefore asked the idmc to conduct a previously unplanned futility analysis of vital 1 in order to determine the overall prospects for our ongoing development program for this product moreover with the cessation of vital 2 we expect to make commensurate adjustments to our business operations and we will provide further details regarding this in the near future as a reminder the company ended the second quarter of 2008 with 166 million in cash
8395363 come osate toccarlo voialtre come osate mettergli gli occhi addosso quando ve lho proibito indietro vi dico qst uomo appartiene a me attente a non tentare di avvicinarlo o avrete a che fare con me
8395364 the final guidance is excellent news for patients with wet amd who are in need of access to this highly effective treatment
8395365 wet amd is a debilitating disease that can rapidly lead to loss of vision and all too often to loss of independence and quality of life for patients when fully implemented the nice decision will ensure that patients have access to lucentis for as long as they need to preserve or improve their vision
8395366 we are committed to working in partnership with health authorities to ensure that as many patients as possible with wet amd can benefit from treatment with lucentis
8395367 this reimbursement scheme is an important collaboration that will ensure patients living with wet amd in england and wales receive the best possible care
8395368 this is really a fun time to be part of the hardworking middle class hillary and barack tell us all the time were the backbone of america
8395369 you bet and now we have that scrappy catholic kid from scranton on the ticket hes one of us you know

8395371 yes sir that scrappy kid from scranton is a real blue collar guy im gonna light a candle for him at church this sunday and thank god for making me and joe the backbone of america
8395372 cuanto mayor sea el deber de obrar con prudencia y pleno conocimiento de las cosas mayor ser la obligaci n que resulte de las consecuencias posibles de los hechos
8395373 our discovery of life on mars is the biggest news in the history of earth
8395374 but we felt it would be better received during the republican convention
8395375 well as a courtesy he could be the next president we advised senator obama of life on mars and he raised some serious objections
8395376 he said the question of when a microbe can actually be called alive with specificity is beyond his pay grade he thought it would be more accurate to call them animated microbes
8395377 exactly he also suggested we order the mars lander to abort the microbes immediately he said if those microbes are bacterial they could pose a danger to the health of the lander itself or at least a serious inconvenience
8395378 well just wait for the gop convention to announce life on mars the republicans are pretty excited about it
8395379 the dramatic clinical results from this study of gleevec in the adjuvant gist setting are especially encouraging when we consider the incremental benefit we typically see with other adjuvant therapies for solid tumors
8395380 the adjuvant use of gleevec if approved would represent an important advance in the ongoing post surgery management of gist

8395447 everyone was asking me before what it was going to be like i was like i dont know i havent talked to her in 10 or 15 years i had that tension and i started to let it get to me is she going to be nice is it going to be a bad environment but when i saw her everything was fine
8395448 i think when youre 18 your personalities conflict then you meet up 10 or 15 years later and the playing ground is totally different and youre fine
8395449 it let me find a little bit of peace and discover who i was as a person
8395450 not the person who the press made me out to be because id had a few bad experiences in my personal life and i was struggling to figure out a bad husband or a bad boyfriend and i was doing it under the spotlight so i wasnt reacting well to any of it
8395451 i dont think we ever hit each other scratching im not going to deny that
8395452 all those people who wrote the i hate brenda newsletter are going to get mad at me now like why are you leaving your child with brenda

8395454 i heard about it on one of the local news stations on my commute in that they were offering the chance to drive these
8395455 youre not sacrificing anything and actually for me its an enhanced driving experience
8395456 i think thats a misconception people have that youre puttering around in an underpowered cramped little soapbox
8395457 its allowed people to live with these vehicles in a way that they dont have to feel restricted in the distances they can travel or where they can go
8395458 as i was putting him in the car i was wondering is it the engine noise that quiets the baby or the road noise we had no idea
8395459 we found out its probably the road noise and the motion
8395460 it didnt have much to do with the engine noise since theres no internal combustion engine
8395461 over time the subscriber growth will be much more a function of cable and international distribution deals
8395462 weve had a real focus on trying to drive our subscriber acquisition cost numbers down a lot of that is being able to develop better opportunities for third parties to market us

8395471 theres a lot he can do at the convention to prove his respect for both clintons that would be very very welcome
8395472 if that were done it would be inevitable that millions of people would support obama with time money and votes
8395473 youre constantly in a recruiting mode if this population keeps churning youre constantly training
8395474 youve got to fill the slots but you want quality people who are not going to leave
8395475 you dont want to spend time and resources on someone if theyre just going to up and leave
8395476 the solution is to give the border patrol chief a bit of breathing space to find the right recruits
8395477 in any job or any career the first year or two youre learning whether its for you
8395478 ive just got to sit my time on the line watching the fence
8395479 i thought it would be an opportunity to get in federal law enforcement

8395484 even though there have been several studies demonstrating that experts in a subject area are better at remembering information relevant to their field of expertise this knowledge can also lead them astray the classic expert novice study by chase and simon in 1973 pitted experts against novices remembering the arrangement of chess pieces on the board when the pieces were arranged in an actual position arrived at during real game play the experts were much better than the novices but when the pieces were randomly arranged experts did no better than novices more recent work has found that although doctors are better than interns at making medical diagnoses the experts dont remember the details of each case as well as the interns

8395488 i was already planning on spending the rest of my life with her but until youre married you just dont know it feels wonderful
8395489 we expect the difficult trading environment to persist for some time
8395490 we would expect the company to continue taking out cost to mitigate revenue declines to a degree and the presence of a strategic investor should provide some support to shares
8395491 but with cyclical structural pressures accelerating we continue to remain cautious
8395492 we expect to deliver a result reflective of these initiatives and the difficult market conditions
8395493 really dont want to change a lot on the platform
8395494 now that presents some really dicey options for the republican party
8395495 i think everybody has to look at what the alternative is
8395496 thats the sign of a good team one that can win in different ways
8395497 weve been able to win the last couple of weeks by sitting back and swinging the bat today we werent swinging the bats very well so we were able to play a little bit different game and it ended up working out for us
8395498 youve got to make sure to take same approach every pitch every at bat every game and not let the mental errors and mental mistakes get to you
8395499 that says a lot for this team how good we feel were going and how good we can be and how were not going to let up until the season is over
8395500 it stayed in and everything was good and i got an rbi once again weve got to do the little things
8395501 one ball left the infield and they got two runs so what can you do
8395502 i felt like i did pretty well especially against that offense but marquis was on his game so theres not a lot i could do
8395503 my leg was straight and i couldnt bend it the muscle was in spasm and i had a lot of pain
8395504 as you can see i am completely out of breath she really pushed me to the limit
8395505 i was just trying to come back to normal position where i could just stand up and regroup again and play the next point
8395506 i thought i was going to get my dress really dirty that was my biggest concern
8395507 i would have loved to take a nap on the court because i was really exhausted but you know the rules are the rules i had to keep going
8395508 we didnt have him in team work tuesday but he did fine and hasnt experienced any problems
8395509 so far so good hell get a little more work today
8395510 weve been telling you guys that hes been doing a lot of things and we have a pretty extensive workout before we let guys get back on the field
8395511 they go through a routine on the side and do some individual work and its like a decathlon so when we clear guys to come back i usually dont worry about how theyre going to be
8395512 its still to be determined from what we do and a lot of that will be based on the medical report on jim and peyton
8395513 so those guys gray and lorenzen are both going to play well see how they do and then well determine whether we keep four three or two
8395514 but hey you know what they say when you assume
8395515 the trade situation has already been presented the game doesnt really matter
8395516 i know jeff was visiting getting more looks at it
8395517 thats the sign of a good team one that can win in different ways
8395518 weve been able to win the last couple of weeks by sitting back and swinging the bat today we werent swinging the bats very well so we were able to play a little bit different game and it ended up working out for us
8395519 youve got to make sure to take same approach every pitch every at bat every game and not let the mental errors and mental mistakes get to you
8395520 that says a lot for this team how good we feel were going and how good we can be and how were not going to let up until the season is over
8395521 it stayed in and everything was good and i got an rbi once again weve got to do the little things
8395522 one ball left the infield and they got two runs so what can you do
8395523 i felt like i did pretty well especially against that offense but marquis was on his game so theres not a lot i could do
8395524 hes one of our main guys but we dont think its a season ending injury
8395525 the time frame it fluctuates but hopefully with his youth and hes been pretty durable and resilient to injury hopefully he does get back soon
8395526 with the offseason moves we made hopefully we can still play at a high level this year to me its more something that you look at as a challenge and you dont let it defeat you you deal with it
8395527 training camp was going to be an important part of his development
8395528 thats going to be postponed obviously but hes got a lot of development on and off the court that hes going to continue to do ive got a lot of confidence in him and now his job is to get healthy
8395529 just in talking to nellie today were talking about maybe spreading that ball around and getting scoring from different areas
8395530 marcus is more of a pass first point guard if at some point he thought he didnt get a chance in new jersey hes going to get a chance now
8395531 he hasnt come in expecting anything just because of what he did in high school wilson said
8395532 hes shown me and the rest of the guys that hes gonna earn his position earn his spot and so far hes done that every day
8395533 he doesnt let that hype get to him receiver mike mccoy said
8395534 hes real laid back hes cool on and off the field we hang out all the time this past weekend we just kicked it together hes a humble guy
8395535 hes a great athlete a great guy both on and off the field
8395536 some people have got it some people dont hes one who has it
8395537 hes consistently made plays in practice and in both scrimmages saban said
8395538 after the first scrimmage it was pretty evident that he was going to have some role as one of the three receivers that we use quite a bit
8395539 this last week he certainly solidified his position as the starter he and mike mccoy have been our two best receivers throughout this camp
8395540 they thought he was going to be but hes a hard worker smith said
8395541 hes not out boasting about what hes going to do he just lets his actions speak louder than his words

8395648 this resolution still faces challenges but its a step in the right direction
8395649 were moving in the right direction and this couldnt have been done without john mccains unwavering commitment to the new hampshire primary
8395650 i have never felt more confident in our strategy by accepting the sanction we made it more likely that the committee favored our position

8395656 nu vreau s o mai vad pe fata asta scapa de ea
8395657 ii voi intenta un proces penal si ii voi cere retroactiv banii care mi se cuvin din 2000 pana acum si cum ea castiga in jur de 60 000 de euro pe luna ar fi ceva cam 45 de milioane de euro dupa calculele mele

8395661 theres no race in the country that more starkly epitomizes the choice in this election in november than new hampshire
8395662 john sununu my opponent has been labeled the most vulnerable republican in the united states senate
8395663 the talents of women are underused in the church and maybe society in general and i think that the church is gradually put that word in realizing it personally i feel very fulfilled in my mission but can appreciate the frustrations of others
8395664 hey fine gentleman my bid price bearing went in low spirits gotta ensue the convo even now
8395665 the life long therapy of hiv is still a major a chronic disease to have to live with
8395666 additionally we have a major roadblock in that we have many new yorkers who are hiv infected and not aware
8395667 its about our students and their future its about keeping pace with the demands of a growing city its about eliminating pockets of overcrowding which weve made great progress in doing so over the past five years
8395668 working together with albany with our leaders in the legislature and our governor we made it 13 1 billion and that has had a massive impact over whats going on in construction in new york
8395669 the better our public schools get the more people are going to want to come live here and send their kids to public school
8395670 it is a daunting challenge but its an awful lot better challenge than some other cities have where their schools arent crowded
8395671 last night she set the stage and tonight she finished it
8395672 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8395673 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8395674 i think she accomplished what she needed to accomplish which was to tell her loyal followers to get on board to remember that theyre a democrat and to vote democratic
8395675 i think she couldve been a little more supportive of obama
8395676 like could have said im sorry i said those things like he wouldnt make a good commander in chief i think she shouldve thrown that in
8395677 barack obama has a different vision and a different plan right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right and the status quo just wont cut it
8395678 now let me tell you if you think youve seen dramatic changes in the world in technology in the last ten years you aint seen nothing yet
8395679 unlike senator clinton i have no kind of ambiguity about my candidate
8395680 she said her candidate is unprepared to be president i announced when i was running that if i wasnt running i would support john mccain so im very enthusiastic
8395681 if the president isnt exactly on our side call the first lady and with michelle obama we are going to have somebody who answers that phone
8395682 she has broke so many stereotypes changed the perception forever gotten rid of the notion that no longer a woman could be president that is over those days are gone
8395683 i want to say this up front i honor john mccains service to our country he served in uniform with honor and distinction and he deserves we owe him gratitude for that but we dont owe him our vote because the stakes are too high
8395684 angesichts der zuletzt konstant schlechten nachrichten von den finanz und kreditm rkten war es sch n zur abwechslung mal etwas positives zu h ren
8395685 das vorherrschende gef hl ist nicht dass die situation viel besser geworden ist aber dass der grad der abw rtsbewegung nachgelassen haben k nnte in diesem umfeld ist das genug um optimismus zu erzeugen
8395686 will you take a picture of me with the senator
8395687 you are seeing impeachment as a constitutional crisis impeachment is the
8395688 just the three of us 15 kicks each two days you could cut the tension with a knife everyone was very focused we just went out there we knew what the circumstances were you pretty much just go out there and perform
8395689 it fired me up just to see that but then when i thought about it and i was like well this is just another test for us jay still has to come in and perform and obviously he didnt
8395690 the fact is that i cant think about ok hes here now are they just going to hand him the job now i need to go out and beat him and make that clear if you would have seen me out there i was very focused i didnt look at his kicks or connors kicks it was just kind of the eye of the tiger and i went out there and did the best i could
8395691 i dont know i think this game is hopefully there are a lot of opportunities a lot of field goal opportunities instead of just one like last week we can prove ourselves again and show that we can that i can go out there and be the kicker for the entire season and be here for a long time
8395692 its anybodys guess right now but hey itll probably hit somewhere inside that cone
8395693 since her grades were good its ok to break the law
8395694 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8395695 if we dont have an official roll call vote state by state it is going to reopen a wound
8395696 if shes not a strong enough leader to get her followers to do whats right for america then that would surprise me
8395697 ill never say never and ill never say never again

8395732 and just why do so few white men marry black women
8395733 hi ann if i recall correctly you and i had an exchange on another forum about black women and white men as potential dating and married partners i will gladly offer comments again as i have plenty to say for now i would like to offer this thought i think it would be great if we could somehow get three or four white men and yes three to four black men too to offer their comments on their black wives e g what attracted them to their wives what they love best about their wives the unique qualities their wives possess their children together etc the white men in particular are few but they are out there i think it would be a unique accompaniment to the discussion you have above

8395770 podamos estar apuntalando todos para que naci n pueda revertir eso del discurso donde la presidenta kirchner compara a una persona pobre de santa cruz que ser a de clase media en cualquier otra provincia del nea y noa por ello debe haber aportes desde el orden nacional para que esa situaci n se pueda dar vuelta
8395771 no puede ser que haya una relaci n de uno a tres respecto a lo que recibe un alumno de misiones con relaci n a lo que recibe en otra jurisdicci n como capital federal o sino nunca vamos a poder equipararnos con lo que reciben otras provincias creando un escenario tan injusto en la distribuci n de los recursos
8395772 lo que haga falta en materia de recursos humanos docentes infraestructura aulas y salas de nivel inicial haciendo hincapie en la sala obligatoria de 5 a os como el primer escal n para la escolarizaci n en cualquier comunidad
8395773 el primer punto es el tema de los recursos pero si ten s solo los recursos y te falta una estrategia pueden haber errores creo que el mayor defecto de las provincias pobres en las ltimas d cadas fue no definir una estrategia pedag gica para atender especialmente a los sectores m s excluidos de la sociedad

8395793 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8395794 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8395795 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8395796 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8395797 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8395814 burger for crying out loud you realize the difference between rendering an open world and a small square contained field right
8395815 either way the point remains that it cant realistically be compared to a football game
8395816 if the ps2 can render hundreds of good looking monsters in a barren field capcom can put just 100 zombies in a detailed mall setting no excuses the duck has spoken
8395817 if you want stop the stupid meme that hardcore third party games don t sell on wii please stop crying and buy this game it could give capcom incentives to port resident evil 5 on wii too

8395828 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8395829 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8395830 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8395831 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8395832 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8395833 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8395834 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about

8395846 i was assured by the states attorney that this investigation is private and is a secret so im surprised that this information was leaked to the media
8395847 so i have to be suspect about who leaked this to the media
8395848 i dont know any reason why they would reach that conclusion i dont have anything to do with the investigation thats going on i have not done anything illegal in any way shape or form

8395875 we here have an opportunity to make a difference doing research with our students
8395876 in the back of my mind i knew this was a possibility
8395877 there are different ideas flowing around and it may have to do with nutritional payoff
8395878 it appears that taste preferences are evolving humans prefer sugar and fat like ice cream and butter our ancestors needed that to survive
8395879 if you have an entrepreneurial spirit usc will back you up

8395881 all these years since his marriage with ms bhutto in 1987 i have known zardari on no occasion did i find him absent minded or forgetful as reported

8395883 preventing blood clot formation is one of the main goals when treating patients with arrhythmia which can result in a stroke and damage to the brain
8395884 while warfarin is a very effective therapy for the prevention of blood clot formation we are hopeful this clinical research will result in another treatment option for patients with atrial fibrillation
8395885 cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer related mortality for women between the ages of 16 and 65 in peru
8395886 few women in that region of the world have access to proper cervical cancer screening even if they do get a pap smear the only way to screen for the disease the tests are often poorly interpreted because of a lack of necessary training
8395887 i see women with invasive cervical cancer every time we go to peru
8395888 we always dreamed of establishing a permanent presence in peru
8395889 though cusco is the economic and transportation hub of the mountain region of peru there is extreme poverty among the natives a lot of wealth travels through there because it is a popular tourist destination but the women who live in the region are extremely disenfranchised we also wanted to continue to expand our services to rural areas where access to cervical cancer screening is even more limited
8395890 it is so important to have that as a resource to have that permanent presence its also an incredibly important resource for mcg as an international site for research patient care and education
8395891 we operate with donated equipment and supplies the clinic is built but we still need operational money our efforts evolved from a volunteer humanitarian effort the essence has always been altruism and humanitarian work something thats very important to expose future health professionals to
8395892 given the current urgency and necessity to mitigate the challenges of climate change professionals and research decisions will affect how we relate to and design the physical environment
8395893 climate change strategies highlighted in day one of the climate change seminar will focus on the effects of climate on nebraskas physical environment all the discussions over the two days will explore the upstream and downstream relationships between nebraskas cities and farms showing how climate effects affect innovative solutions and research directions at the university of nebraska which in turn affect climate
8395894 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8395895 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8395896 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8395897 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8395898 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer
8395899 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough
8395900 and berries are not enough we never get 100 percent tumor inhibition with berries so we need to think about another food that we can add to them that will boost the chemopreventive activities of berries alone
8395901 it is unlike rural nebraskans to believe anything requires action by government especially when it involves promulgation of rules about how you live your life
8395902 people are paying attention way more than theyre given credit for theyre attentive to sound science

8395907 our student engagement program is designed to get our students involved during the first six weeks of school which is the critical period of time when either you get connected and involved and stay out of trouble or you dont
8395908 part of our approach is to help students create social connections our students arrive here from all over the world and theyre trying to connect
8395909 we also want to encourage students to move outside their comfort zone and take local trips to cultural events participate in a student talent show or try bowling many of us are working very hard to ensure a healthy learning environment that takes into account learning in and outside the classroom
8395910 we have over 700 incoming students who showed interest in community service and this is significant because several researchers have found that higher levels of student volunteerism is associated with decreased risk for alcohol consumption
8395911 we anticipated a high number of students wanting to get involved in sports related activities but are ecstatic with the numbers expressing interest in prevention efforts and giving back to the community
8395912 the first few weeks of freshman year is an especially exciting time however it can also be a period of uneasy changes and adjustments
8395913 in order to make the transition as smooth as possible for freshmen the university of colorado student union offers many ways to get involved in the campus community and meet new friends
8395914 i take issue with those who have argued that the bush ii administrations approach to u s grand strategy its determination to maintain overwhelming u s geopolitical dominance and its muscular idealism breaks sharply with the principles and assumptions that guided earlier u s policymakers nothing could be farther from the truth

8395916 defending the nations core values its organizing ideology and its free political and economic institutions
8395917 is far too deeply entrenched in americas political culture and foreign policy tradition to be dismissed
8395918 but wrights latest round of media appearances have not seemed to me to be any kind of defense of liberalism or the black church or even black liberation theology so much as one mans desire to deny a rival his destiny
8395919 the open door is as much about ideology as it is about economic expansion and the distribution of power in the international system

8395968 even when women are aggrieved according to our culture men have to speak on their behalf

8395971 besides the fact that we take arvs on an empty stomach the tablets are now rationed
8395972 we used to get 60 tablets to last us the whole month but now that has been halved because we are told that the arvs are not enough to give the months supply
8395973 while the country is affected by a number of socio economic challenges we find it inappropriate for government to finance some activities that are neither priority nor of interest such as the trip that has been undertaken by emakhosikati to his majesty the king children aides bodyguards and their maids
8395974 however we have not seen any concerted efforts by government to build more classrooms to accommodate the number of children into school no increase in the uptake of teachers to cater for the increased number of children in schools and we have no additional budget for school equipment and materials to cater for the high number of children
8395975 we would be less concerned about this particular trip if it was not funded by the central bank which is money from the taxpayer
8395976 what is depressing is that it is the same minister who allocated and approved the funds for the trip of the nine wives their children bodyguards and relatives who have left the country to various international destinations
8395977 if what they are complaining about is reversible then we can reverse and if we cant reverse it government will see what can be done so that it doesnt happen again

8396012 de repente me pregunto por qu tengo que contar esto pero si uno empezara a preguntarse por qu hace todo lo que hace si uno se preguntara solamente por qu acepta una invitaci n a cenar ahora pasa una paloma y me parece que un gorri n o por qu cuando alguien nos ha contado un buen cuento enseguida empieza como una cosquilla en el est mago y no se est tranquilo hasta entrar en la oficina de al lado y contar a su vez el cuento reci n entonces uno est bien est contento y puede volverse a su trabajo que yo sepa nadie ha explicado esto de manera que lo mejor es dejarse de pudores y contar porque al fin y al cabo nadie se averguenza de respirar o de ponerse los zapatos son cosas que se hacen y cuando pasa algo raro cuando dentro del zapato encontramos una ara a o al respirar se siente como un vidrio roto entonces hay que contar lo que pasa contarlo a los muchachos de la oficina o al m dico ay doctor cada vez que respiro siempre contarlo siempre quitarse esa cosquilla molesta del est mago

8396058 it is important to understand that pancreatitis an inflammatory condition of the pancreas is a rare event further the characteristics and complications of the pancreatitis cases in patients on byetta are consistent with pancreatitis in the general population we believe byetta continues to have a positive benefit risk profile for patients with type 2 diabetes
8396059 direct and indirect costs of diabetes in the united states
8396060 poor control of risk factors for vascular disease among adults with previously diagnosed diabetes

8396062 notwithstanding this disappointing outcome we would like to acknowledge the courage and commitment of the patients and physicians who have participated in this trial
8396063 the observation in the vital 2 trial is very surprising to us and we have therefore asked the idmc to conduct a previously unplanned futility analysis of vital 1 in order to determine the overall prospects for our ongoing development program for this product moreover with the cessation of vital 2 we expect to make commensurate adjustments to our business operations and we will provide further details regarding this in the near future as a reminder the company ended the second quarter of 2008 with 166 million in cash

8396066 we are committed to working in partnership with health authorities to ensure that as many patients as possible with wet amd can benefit from treatment with lucentis
8396067 this reimbursement scheme is an important collaboration that will ensure patients living with wet amd in england and wales receive the best possible care

8396230 we had a plan of what we wanted to do we toughed it out and our side came through and we sailed a clean race today it was nice for us to make it stick there have been times in the past where we have been in the lead in the past and worked our way back into the pack today was nice and everyone did a nice job we are a bit more relaxed we have been working very hard on some downwind techniques to get a bit more speed just learning a bit more each time it has taken a bit of while to get one on the board but it is important to feel that we can win paul has had some more time on the boat and things are going well
8396231 we are really liking it here the conditions are interesting challenging and different and it is a nice city

8396234 we had a decent start and john had a good game plan he wanted the right in both races and we managed to get over there and we did a good job of cashing in when it was time or being patient when we had to wait for a shift nacho did a great job trimming the main because there were very difficult conditions out there especially on port tack it was very rough and hard to keep the speed when it is that rough you have to find the right trim where the boat has the best balance and the guys kept the boat balanced very well both up and downwind and we didnt lose our composure
8396235 i think the superstition came true again after winning the practice race as today we won the first regatta and had a good start to the last one but after just a quarter of the first beat we broke the head stay and had to retire a little luck with no third race means we only lose one and i think we can make repairs rapidly to be back in it again tomorrow we are obviously keen to get good results here it is very bad luck to break a piece which is hard to check it either hold or it breaks but these pieces should be solid enough on an offshore boat
8396236 over the past several months we have received a number of significant orders from european customers for our technology and equipment this growth in demand from europe can be directly attributed to the efforts of our italian office and the overall strategy of positioning ourselves in growing markets this latest order is scheduled for completion during fiscal 2009 adding to what is already an exciting year this order is consistent with our goal of serving multinational corporations that we believe can provide a series of opportunities over many years our leading edge technology and excellent project execution contribute significantly to our successful strategy of building long term loyalty and growth through customer satisfaction
8396237 this latest combined police effort has culminated in a total of 230 charges being laid including the alleged production trafficking and distribution of marihuana throughout ottawa and eastern ontario collaboration among police forces has once again shown that a significant impact can be made in keeping illegal drugs out of our communities as part of our governments national anti drug strategy approximately 22 million over two years has been invested to support law enforcement in combating the production and distribution of illicit drugs we are closing gateways used by criminals for their illegal activities through the dedicated persistent and sometimes dangerous activities of our law enforcement officials who should be applauded for their efforts

8396251 theres a strong chance that by friday we could see some fairly significant pump price increases
8396252 crude can be replaced and brought in via tanker but bringing a damaged refinery back up again can take a long time as we saw with katrina and rita

8396332 for new notifications installations in windows xp pro customers will also have a simple eula to accept rather than an installation wizard
8396333 this eula has been modified to allow the anti piracy validation control to auto update itself for future releases

8396517 although it is relatively rare to find the eggs and babies of extinct animals it is even rarer to find them inside the body of the mother
8396518 the turtle specimen was partly broken when it was first discovered it is this fortuitous break that revealed that the fossil was a mother
8396519 based on these fossils we have determined that the ancestor of living hidden necked turtles which are most of todays turtles and tortoises laid a large number of eggs and had hard rigid shells
8396520 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8396521 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8396522 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8396523 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8396524 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8396536 improved technologies have allowed this oil to be extracted with minimal risk of spills indeed natural seepage from the sea floor is a much larger source of oil in american waters than is offshore drilling even safer technologies would be used in any future production
8396537 since the traumatic oil spill in 1969 significant technological improvements on methods of extraction have been made which should appreciably mitigate such spills from happening in the future

8396563 queremos que durante la liturgia quede claro que se trata de un acto cat lico para cat licos que no se hagan generalizaciones respecto a las v ctimas en la misa ni se use el nombre de rub n y que no se refiera por igual a las 154 personas que perdieron la vida
8396564 aunque para la sociedad pueda parecer que el tema del funeral cat lico es una cuesti n menor no lo es as para las v ctimas sobre todo para el caso de nuestro compa ero que ten a profundas creencias religiosas

8396568 si es una convocatoria del estado debe tratarse de un acto institucional en el que est n presentes la corona el gobierno y la oposici n pero sin necesidad de s mbolos religiosos la ceremonia multiconfesional es otra posibilidad pero me quedo con la primera porque seguro que entre las v ctimas tambi n hab a agn sticos

8396572 why is he in drama instead of the class we signed him up for
8396573 the teacher he has is very good but just cant be expected to spend the extra time on a student who doesnt try
8396574 why is he in drama instead of the class we signed him up for
8396575 were getting very confident that before the end of this year well be able to make that decision the closer we are today the better but at least i feel like thats our time frame

8396581 because this campaign was going to set the stage for new rollouts in our series of edge products the senior execs wanted to create a bit of a following
8396582 our audi ence is not used to seeing us in a humorous way were a very serious company
8396583 the site teased the audience a bit and had a social share function
8396584 work in a fast paced cross functional environment providing reliable solutions for clients
8396585 we were trying to find a way to do a better job of connecting with our customers and showing our appreciation for their support of the brand and their loyalty
8396586 we wanted to offer a very special and unique program where they could take advantage of all the wonderful things that are occurring at jordan in addition to the wine
8396587 therefore we work to give women information that helps them make healthy choices for themselves and their loved ones
8396588 women looking online for healthcare information do not want hype
8396589 they respond to directness and authenticity and like to be spoken to as individuals providing educational information is the best way to engage them
8396590 women tend to take more initiative about their health than men do
8396591 rather than just relying on the decision of a doctor they seek information to help make up their own minds
8396592 we are very sensitive about providing information to women at a highly emotional time in their life
8396593 knowledge and information is a comfort to them at this time so we provide them with medically informed content
8396594 a woman can sniff out if you are being patronizing
8396595 she wants to be treated in an authentic and real way without being pandered to
8396596 she is in research mode and because she is looking for information she might be more likely to take action on an offer based on a contex tually relevant page

8396601 the fat cells we found in our obese patients were deficient in several areas
8396602 they showed significant stress on the endoplasmic reticulum and the tissue itself was more inflamed than in our lean patients
8396603 the implication is that having too much fat is not just a cosmetic problem
8396604 that fat is unhealthy and dysfunctional and you ought to do something about it because youll have consequences that affect other organs in your body
8396605 can inhibit insulin action and activate proinflammatory pathways endoplasmic reticulum stress activation of the protein may be a link between obesity insulin resistance and inflammation
8396606 it has been speculated that the reason for endoplasmic reticulum stress in response to nutrient excess may be increased demand for lipid and protein synthesis and for structural changes in the organs primarily involved in metabolizing and storing excess nutrients
8396607 the results may not be representative of fat in other locations
8396608 increase in endoplasmic reticulum stress related proteins and genes in adipose tissue of obese insulin resistant individuals
8396609 there is no evidence that either of the two treatments was superior to the other in the prevention of recurrent stroke
8396610 that there is little likelihood for a clinically important difference between the two regimens with regard to these events
8396611 aspirin and extended release dipyridamole versus clopidogrel for recurrent stroke
8396612 there is substantial acceleration in cognitive decline many years prior to death among individuals without dementia the researchers concluded and the
8396613 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8396614 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
8396615 people remain stable in their verbal abilities unless they are experiencing disease processes that also increase their mortality risk
8396616 a change in verbal ability might therefore be considered a critical marker for degeneration in health in older people

8396618 consistent with the results of previous trials our findings suggest that magnesium sulfate may reduce the chance that cerebral palsy will subsequently be diagnosed in a child who was at high risk for preterm birth
8396619 we performed this study to test the hypothesis that the administration of magnesium sulfate to women at high risk for early preterm delivery would reduce the risk of cerebral palsy in their children
8396620 provide additional reassurance that magnesium sulfate when used for neuroproection does not significantly increase neonatal or infant mortality
8396621 the reduction in the rates of cerebral palsy with use of magnesium sulfate does not seem to be attributable to higher mortality rates among infants with brain damage
8396622 information from long term follow up of children whose mothers received antenatal magnesium sulfate also is needed to clarify the neuroprotective role of this therapy before preterm birth

8396645 in the new innovation model research needs to keep addressing the need of the mother company
8396646 say in the case of integrated circuits there were many many small steps that occurred along the way resulting from decades worth of work in matters of physics
8396647 so the measure of time and the frequency standards that are used to do it date back to research in optical pumping which led to the development of hydrogen maser

8396671 large scale exports of fresh water would be a wealth creating idea for quebec and for canada as a whole
8396672 the development and marketing of this expertise requires a strategic plan to enable quebec to become a leader in water management
8396673 at a time when water is becoming scarce in many parts of the world its economic development stirs up substantial opposition however though some people fear harmful exploitation or even the drying up of our water resources it is urgent to look seriously at developing our blue gold
8396674 were concerned about that we know theres pressure from the u s to export canadas water but we see water as a human right and a public resource
8396675 we dont want to see water commodified and commercialized in this manner
8396676 they see it as an economic opportunity and clearly the motivation here is profit
8396677 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted

8396779 the exciting part of the commissions work here is that this is very doable

8396782 i look forward to carefully reviewing the report and working with all stakeholders to develop both short and long term strategies to address climate change
8396783 that aggressive pollution targets are possible and good for the state not only environmentally but economically
8396784 maryland is less than three tenths of 1 percent of the u s emissions and the u s is not even the largest country in terms of greenhouse gas emissions anymore
8396785 we believe these issues should be addressed on a national level
8396786 not in sync with past and present climate conditions these costs are likely to increase as climate change accelerates
8396787 the costs of inaction are likely to stay and increase
8396788 by lagging behind other states that are already investing in the fast growing clean energy industry maryland is missing out on huge economic development and growth potential
8396789 it sounds as though this is forward thinking its aggressive and particularly appropriate for a state as vulnerable to climate change as maryland
8396790 you dont want a hot dog you just think you want a hot dog
8396791 the corporations made you believe you want a hot dog with advertising
8396792 i want it with bright green relish and yellowy yellow mustard
8396793 hot dogs are the product of corporate exploitation of the workers and your capitalist pig condiments are chemical perversions of the slave picked mustard and cucumber plants eating that hot dog perpetuates the subjugation of millions all for your selfish gratification
8396794 the far left is disorganized because of its inability to demonstrate accomplishment and repels leaders with its condescending tone

8396806 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8396807 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8396808 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8396809 theres always the possibility if it comes from the right direction and if it is large enough to create storm surge in the realm of katrina that there could be overtopping
8396810 you cant look at this storm and make any comparisons to katrina
8396811 im not going to worry about it until i see it in the gulf then ill make my decisions
8396812 please dont let these horrifying images be the last i see

8396817 there is the possibility of creating designer drugs with this newly discovered information
8396818 these are models that conform to the point of view that the structures have been designed to exert very strong control of their motions
8396819 those motions correspond closely to the motions needed for their function

8396824 i figured once i cleared waivers and there wasnt really any action that id finish out the season in atlanta
8396825 but this obviously is exciting to come to a club thats in the playoff race and especially one like boston that has the history of a great tradition
8396826 unfortunately in atlanta things didnt go as well as we would have liked i see atlanta giving me this opportunity and we have to be thankful for that as well
8396827 the one thing ive heard from numerous people is if he can walk hell play
8396828 i know that ive gotten messages from people all over the league that said hes everybodys all time favorite i know hes a real professional i know hes excited about coming here
8396829 he said hell do anything we ask to try to help us win
8396830 he adds a lot to our club hes a plus defensively in center and in right he plays first base he has great instincts hes really a gamer hes the type you want up in a big spot hell help this club on the field and in the clubhouse
8396831 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8396832 so we had a lot of background on him he has a lot of upside thats what you strive for in a trade like this
8396833 they were admitted to this charity a couple of years ago for a period of time but their situation did not suit the organization they couldnt live according to the standards required by the hospital and they affect the people around them so it was a decision of the previous board to release them
8396834 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8396835 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8396836 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8396837 the biggest one is the drop in the legal threshold for intoxication
8396838 our officers will be enforcing that a lot of the other ones there will be a break in period
8396839 is he as stupid as dumb boy huh you could stop all independent publications you could disable richmond miami austin n texas nola and any other imcs that might reveal just how gad damn stupid you are go for it
8396840 bush daddy has kept pestering me about the issue of living dismemberment probably thinking that this is what it means when psalm 53 5 says that god will scatter the bones of those camping against you bush daddy says this means that the limbs of the designated target will be duct taped and cut off each time the person revives another limb will be cut off and or shortened until he or she succumbs
8396841 as i learned when i tried for an ncaa championship in 1974 sports are not worth anything with bush nazis in the works
8396842 hey ed do you know what it means to have such a gad damn stupid person tell you he is a doctor
8396843 let us go and worship the stupidity of these bush nazis
8396844 woe to you o destroyer you who have not been destroyed when you stop destroying you will be destroyed

8396847 i give her my love thats all i do and if you saw my love youd love her too
8396848 be sure hes wearing his gold medals you could say you won them champion sh t eater champion ss picker champion sh thead etc
8396849 on the other hand dumb boy could just bomb beijing and claim all the gold medals he would be the ultimate olympian he would even win the medals for team sports for they would have to forfeit the games these bush nazis can do anything that they put their sh t eaten brains to
8396850 he will guide you into all truth he will not speak on his own he will speak only what he hears or sees and he will tell you what is yet to come
8396851 this guy killed himself i found a gun in his hand and i took it
8396852 oh that that was dreamed up by someone munching turds on the toilet
8396853 i wrote in 98 that david wolf was the one to take over and get davids house of jacob built
8396854 hear this you foolish and senseless people who have eyes that do not see who have ears that do not hear
8396855 look you are trusting in deceptive words that are worthless hear o earth i am bringing disaster on this people the fruit of their schemes because they have not listened to my words
8396856 its just a little bit its not going to kill you
8396857 dr francis cheney 1848 is also eulogized as one of the notable men of early dryden and that probably explains the cheney connection at the white house
8396858 these are the sh theads you want listen to them they talk like idiots

8396864 this defendant is dangerous he is a predator who takes pride in his work
8396865 he earned this day his actions call out for the death penalty
8396866 generally for human beings its pretty hard to maintain impartiality when confronted with such horror
8396867 they can say as much as they want my duty as a juror is to be fair and impartial but theyre human beings theyre not computers the absolute depravity of what occurred there has to have a biasing effect
8396868 how could any juror not want to see this person removed from our list of living human beings how could you live with yourself as a juror if theres any chance this human being could escape from jail and do something like this again
8396869 era preciso alterar alguns dispositivos para a melhor aplicabilidade da lei e sanar algumas dificuldades operacionais em sua implanta o

8396871 it makes sense theyll be together in the twin cities
8396872 home run speech was perfect just enough to appease the left and still assure mccain wins
8396873 far more so than the one mcgovern gave in 68 or than reagan gave in 76 or than kennedy gave in 1980 but it would have been nice to hear her give one real reason for obamas candidacy beyond that he was running against a republican
8396874 something was corrupted in a file that brought the whole system down
8396875 salt lake city is designed to handle 125 percent of atlantas normal volume
8396876 but it quickly became more than that because airlines were starting to refile flight plans that were kicked out that created huge queues so the system couldnt handle any of them
8396877 barack obama got a special deal from a convicted felon
8396878 the key to prevention is to avoid the mosquito bite
8396879 if you have the time and or space why not
8396880 we ran up to the bridge to see what had happened and saw that there were cars backed up in both directions which wasnt something new because of the time of day
8396881 but then i looked down at craft house and saw this coach on its side and people were walking around injured and in a daze
8396882 there was this one man who was still stuck in the wreck the man who died i got to him first because he was sticking out of the back of the bus and he was moaning when i saw him
8396883 i just thought to myself is he the only one or are there more people in the wreck
8396884 i tried to speak to him but he was just moaning in agony because he was crushed in the wreckage i did not want to move him
8396885 i dont think i could have moved him even if i had tried so i had to leave him to deal with the other people who had come out of the wreckage
8396886 we used anything we could find for dressings including curtains and coats from the coach as well as bags and cuddly toys that they had won at alton towers as cushions
8396887 the images of the man who passed away kept coming into my mind
8396888 he also told me about his brothers and sisters who live in latvia and about why he had come over
8396889 i also learnt that he was only here for the season and once the harvest is over he will be going back for the winter
8396890 he told me about how they had planned this great day out in one of the countrys best theme parks i developed this bond with somebody i had never met before
8396891 mit uns haben au enstehende kontakt aufgenommen die k nftige m glichkeiten f r das viper gesch ft pr fen wollen
8396892 i have to say katie holmes has become so much more sophisticated in so many ways but i think shes in a dip right now i cant explain it

8396894 the grand old party is no longer grand its just old
8396895 talk about being for it before you are against it
8396896 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8396897 hillary will do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us that makes 18 million of us
8396898 that campaign created so much heat it increased global warming
8396899 john mccain doesnt think there is a problem maybe because none of his seven houses are in foreclosure
8396900 you think that just because im in congress i listen to boring music
8396901 it is time to make america work for working americans
8396902 john mccain is reckless and dangerous and deserves to be in a pasture and not the white house
8396903 cease my son to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge
8396904 in the multitude of words there wanteth not sin but he that refraineth his lips is wise
8396905 thou art snared with the words of thy mouth thou art taken with the words of thy mouth
8396906 the words of a mans mouth are as deep waters and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook
8396907 het is jammer dat op internet het politieke en maatschappelijke debat gemonopoliseerd wordt door rechtsige sites als geenstijl wij willen daar graag een aanvulling op bieden waar onfatsoenlijke bijdragen streng gemodereerd worden

8396911 we call for all church and christian educational institutions of catholic protestant independent and unaffiliated christian denominations in the service of society to close for one day
8396912 communal organizations have taken the law into their hands in 12 districts of orissa and are going about targeting not only institutions but also persons what is at stake is not only the freedom of conscience of a minority community but indias secular democracy its commitment to human rights and constitutional guarantees the destructive and divisive communal forces have to be stopped we want this message to go across to our fellow countrymen and that is why we are closing our educational institutions on friday 29th august 2008 in deep sorrow and anguish we hope parents become aware of the implications of the incidents in orissa we also request all our people to pray for the victims of violence in orissa and other places and their near and dear ones we also pray for the misguided perpetrators of violence that they may mend their ways and become responsible citizens
8396913 we call on key members of the international community to consider offering sanctuary to eritrean refugees and asylum seekers
8396914 our thoughts and prayers are with the thousand men and women currently detained in the wia military camp in eritrea suffering unimaginable hardship and mistreatment in the most arduous conditions their fate should serve as a stark reminder of the appalling consequences of returning vulnerable people to countries where they have a well founded fear of persecution

8396927 guys you cant stand there youve got to keep moving move move move
8396928 a lot of people struggle with it but it shouldnt be a struggle
8396929 most people dont say im mixed race but im this race and that race
8396930 how real is race a sourcebook on race culture and biology
8396931 none of this makes sense from a biological point of view
8396932 race has everything to do with culture and socially constructed borderlines

8396934 we might approach a couple records here or there but were not seeing any records today henderson said
8396935 try as hard as possible to stay out of the sun and heat
8396936 im afraid those numbers may more accurately reflect whats happening with the vaccination of young children said dr
8396937 its unlikely that many will catch up before they enter school and with exemptions so easily granted they dont have to
8396938 weve already dropped below the level of vaccine coverage where herd immunity exists for some diseases at some point were going to be forced to decide whether it is an inalienable right to catch and transmit potentially fatal infections
8396939 measles is imported into this country all the time but this year weve seen it spread to much larger groups of unvaccinated people as many as 30 in one group of home schooled children in illinois than weve had in recent years
8396940 most first line vaccines are about 85 to 95 percent effective so even those who have done the right thing by getting vaccinated on time have a 10 to 20 percent chance theyre still unprotected omer said
8396941 so if im one of those people what are the consequences of people around me not doing the right thing it puts me in a great deal of danger
8396942 we took him to our local emergency room and they were treating him like it was an asthma attack but this one young doctor asked me if hed been vaccinated i said no and within seconds he realized how life threatening matthews condition really was he saved his life
8396943 i didnt think twice about shots but then we started hearing about the autism concerns and it seemed like i was surrounded by friends with children getting diagnosed with those conditions
8396944 i saw so many cards come through stating the mother wanted a religious exemption from vaccination
8396945 baby shots but when lacek asked her pediatrician if she could prove to her there was no mercury in the vaccines
8396946 i think making people aware of real life stories like ours letting them know that these killer diseases vaccines are meant to prevent are still out there helps put the risks in a different light lacek said
8396947 i still have friends that dont immunize and i understand their reasons but you need to balance those fears with social responsibility enderlein said
8396948 i worry at some point were going to hit some critical mass of unvaccinated kids and see an epidemic thats a lot more compelling than the possibility of adverse reactions to vaccines
8396949 my old government teacher will probably flip when he hears im going to the white house
8396950 its the oval office the lincoln bedroom the cabinet room the presidents personal sleeping quarters think of all the decisions that have been made in these places over the years
8396951 but on the tour day were going to take a group photo on the roof its going to be pretty incredible
8396952 it was my little contribution to help with the nations budget deficit
8396953 when you stand on the roof of the white house you think my god how does this happen to a guy who works on chimneys but thats whats great about this country anything is possible its just a matter of finding a way to do it and following up on it
8396954 he could probably tell from my application that i was on my knees begging it was pretty pathetic
8396955 i think the guy asked me how many jobs i had done and i was like yours and one more will be two
8396956 munson is so expensive now it would be fine to do so as none of the others are anywhere close to the same value

8396958 my biggest disappointment was when i found out a few weeks ago that i would be missing the olympics and u s open
8396959 a lot more goes into a tournament than just playing
8396960 any references to saudis and terrorist s in the book
8396961 could potentially create libel lawsuits as it could offend saudis living in england and this has happened with many other u s publications and we do not want to be jeopardized in selling this book
8396962 i can assure you we take all precautions all rules of engagement are followed we have tremendous confidence and faith in our leadership here in afghanistan
8396963 the enemy which is trying to do things to make a propaganda campaign out of such incidents so nobody benefits
8396964 definitely we ourselves and the international community will exercise maximum caution to prevent such incidents which go against all of our wishes and all of the ideals which we are here fighting for
8396965 prevent the repetition of such incidents which are so unfortunate
8396966 having these eyes in the sky that allow us to locate the taliban to see in some instances where they are making these ieds improvised explosive devices that are having such a horrific effect on the troops and the civilian population
8396967 there is no question that this has been a tough season very difficult sledding for our forces as well as our allies
8396968 youre f king doing my show if i have to hunt you down skin you alive and have one of the other models wear you
8396969 hundreds of thousands for children are going to school this fall without protection from deadly diseases
8396970 at some point were going to be forced to decide whether it is an inalienable right to catch and transmit potentially fatal infections
8396971 one size fits all vaccine policy imposed by government health agencies
8396972 weve seen a doubling of the number of vaccines and doses that the government recommends to stay healthy before age 6 while at the same time weve seen a tripling of the number of children with learning disabilities asthma diabetes and other conditions
8396973 the only way to put the question to rest is to do the proper science
8396974 no one is saying this is necessarily all due to the increase in vaccines but vaccines shouldnt be left off the table when no one has come up with an answer fisher said
8396975 parents simply have to be educated and put in the best position to consider the risks and benefits of vaccines and the various diseases
8396976 and i think government and industry need to spend more be more proactive on vaccine safety research
8396977 on the front lines no provider should be dismissive of parents with concerns about vaccines you should listen and try to address them not kick them out of your practice he added
8396978 the safety movement was largely launched by middle class moms who had the education and time to analyze the medical literature but now were in a third generation of parents dealing with these issues and its a more diverse group with a much broader reach because of the internet they can see that adverse reaction reports are similar around the world
8396979 the public health infrastructure of this country the cdc and the vaccine industry operate on the ideology that some adverse reactions to vaccines are acceptable to serve the greater public good but how many is too many 5 5000 or 5 million its a slippery ethical slope

8396984 i dont collect quotes but have always loved this one it is a bit convoluted i suspect because translated from the french but the ideas come through
8396985 none the less he knew the tale he had to tell could not be one of final victory it could only be the record of what had had to be done and what assuredly would have to be done again in the never ending fight against terror and its relentless onslaughts despite their personal afflictions by all who while unable to be saints but refusing to bow down to pestilences strive their utmost to be healers
8396986 martin kaymer and schuco teeing off for a what we do
8396987 striving for the highest standards of professionalism and a strong commitment to climate protection are both things that matter to me a lot in schuco ive found a partner with the same goals that i have thats why im so glad to be working together with them
8396988 the industrys overwhelming commitment to helping homeowners avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes is undeniable and steadfast
8396989 because of hope nows vast and multifaceted efforts more than 2 million families and the communities in which they live are much better off today than they otherwise would have been

8396996 there are still things we want to do with the african setting and i think its safe to say well continue to explore it
8396997 i was really hoping that a few more guys would come along with us and we would have a better chance of staying away and setting up a bit of a gc general classification
8396998 but there was only four of us out there and unfortunately we lost two of them about halfway through so there was just me and the other aussie guy left out front he was really strong and we gave it a good shot
8396999 ive got a strong team here so im sure theyll help me defend it

8397005 interesting mix of neoconservative for lack of a better term and traditional middle of the road internationalist
8397006 there has been an element in american foreign policy which has been expressed in both liberal democratic administrations and conservative republican administrations for making the world in our image thats american its just that the latest manifestation has been by a conservative republican administration i e the bush presidency
8397007 multilateral regional and bilateral efforts to reduce barriers to trade level ing the global playing field and build ing effective enforcement of global trading rules
8397008 the argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies one perhaps of the right and the other of the left is a foolish idea acceptable only to the doctrinaire and academic thinkers
8397009 instead the two parties should be almost identical so that the american people can throw the rascals out at any election without leading to any profound or extreme shifts in policy
8397010 the chief problem of american political life for a long time has been how to make the two parties more national and international
8397011 function ing as a great world power in cooperation with other powers
8397012 provid ing the basic social necessities for all our citizens
8397013 the capture of the republican national party by the extremist elements of the republican congressional party in 1964 and their effort to elect barry goldwater to the presidency with the petty bourgeois extremists note the marxist terminology alone was only a temporary aberration on the american political scene
8397014 the nearest thing we have to a ruling establishment in the united states
8397015 a retinue of people who look like america as president bill clinton once put it but they very definitely look like the people who for more than a century have managed our international affairs and our military industrial complex
8397016 there has been no deal with china to censor the internet
8397017 one problem with politicians is that when problems they create come to a head they typically feel this irresistible urge to do something rather than to un do something
8397018 think of me and release me from his mental harassment and hammering
8397019 the law defines almost any interpersonal maladjustment as domestic violence the courts then establish procedures to expedite the issuance of these orders
8397020 he has a long history of verbal and emotional abuse
8397021 in divorce and child custody cases a party generally obtains favorable treatment when the other party has engaged in domestic violence
8397022 which includes reasonable apprehension of physical harm and creating fear of physical harm by harassment psychological abuse could impact the parenting plan approved by the family court
8397023 parent must have repeatedly made fraudulent reports of domestic violence or child abuse
8397024 the man now homeless and distraught has only a few days to find a lawyer and prepare a defense
8397025 domestic violence claims increased 466 from 1 065 to 6 029
8397026 in nonreciprocally violent relationships women were the perpetrators in more than 70 percent of the cases reciprocity was associated with more frequent violence among women but not men
8397027 women were slightly more likely than men to use one or more acts of physical aggression and to use such acts more frequently
8397028 around 30 journalists and 50 internet users are currently detained in china some of them since the 1980s
8397029 with 30 days to go before the opening ceremony of the beijing games we are witnessing the proliferation of serious human rights abuses committed under the banner of the official olympics stability drive
8397030 its supposed to be hu jintaos olympics but it will become the dalai lamas olympics if he attends
8397031 political and religious oppression censorship entrenched rural poverty family planning excesses and rampant corruption

8397036 we are trying to balance the right to have a handgun for use of self defense in the home with protecting our citizens
8397037 a handgun for use of self defense in the home
8397038 anti gun politicians can no longer deny that the second amendment guarantees a fundamental right
8397039 our campaign to enact sensible gun laws will be undiminished by the supreme courts decision in the heller case
8397040 is far from a victory for gun owners it is already being used successfully to infringe upon the rights of gun owners across the country
8397041 ban on handgun possession in the home violates the second amendment as does its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self defense
8397042 rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of self defense
8397043 the right of the people to keep and bear arms
8397044 the right of the people to keep and bear arms
8397045 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
8397046 it would mean that the national firearms acts restrictions on machineguns might be unconstitutional
8397047 if weapons that are most useful in military service m 16 rifles and the like may be banned then the second amendment right is completely detached from the militia clause but the conception of the militia at the time of the second amendments ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty it may well be true today that a militia to be as effective as militias in the 18th century would require sophisticated arms that are highly unusual in society at large but the fact that modern developments have limited the degree of fit between the militia clause and the protected right cannot change our interpretation of the right
8397048 to be as effective as militias in the 18th century
8397049 the right secured by the second amendment is not unlimited
8397050 nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms
8397051 we identify these presumptively lawful regulatory measures only as examples our list does not purport to be exhaustive
8397052 the right of the people to keep and bear arms
8397053 declining to establish a level of scrutiny for evaluating second amendment restrictions
8397054 the right of law abiding responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home
8397055 the right of the people to keep and bear arms

8397061 this report adds to the growing number of indications that the major problems may be easing
8397062 housing seems to be stabilising businesses are spending money and consumer confidence is edging up while we should not expect to see any major upturn in activity the rest of this year we could evade having any quarter post negative growth
8397063 does threaten the energy complex in the gulf and will undoubtedly have an impact on residents along the gulf coast of mississippi and louisiana who are still recovering from hurricane katrina which hit the same area two years ago
8397064 the textbook says that the stock market should brace for the storm as well as it did in 2005 ahead of hurricane katrina hitting louisiana and mississippi with gustav tracking through cuba heading for the gulf of mexico we have a hard time seeing the stock market sustaining a rally going into the labour day weekend
8397065 the gbpchf could break through 2 0963 in order to complete a larger correction that began at 1 9421 however the advance to 2 0963 was in 3 waves so it is very much possible that the corrective advance is complete and that the next move is lower in a 5th wave to below 1 9421
8397066 another leg down in the triangle could test 1 93 or so before a bounce bigger picture triangles are continuation patterns so a continuation of the longer term downtrend is likely eventually
8397067 divergence among price and rsi suggest a sharp pullback is likely near term resistance is former support just above 2 65
8397068 my internal clock is telling me all right lets go and ive still got a month to wait
8397069 i think theres a lot less to worry about in the nhl as coach and general manager in kitchener i oversaw every detail of training camp from travel to booking ice time to cutting players to scheduling exhibition games
8397070 at this level youve got people that do all those things you just coach
8397071 i always wanted to coach in the nhl i knew that
8397072 at the same time i wasnt in a rush to get there i really appreciated the level i was at
8397073 i really want to go in with a clean slate with this team
8397074 no pre conceived opinions on the players i really want to give them the opportunity in camp to come out and prove themselves regardless of whats happened in the past here or how theyve played and performed
8397075 when you dont make the playoffs for seven or eight years there is some baggage that gets dragged through year to year with you
8397076 were going to try and eliminate that and start fresh

8397081 although this will affect our revenue in the near term we believe this will help us to continue to grow our player base and active paying accounts in the long run to date most zt online players have accepted these new changes as part of the revenue model adjustments we have also initiated our segmentation strategy by launching zt online classic edition into closed beta at the end of july thus far the market reaction to zt online classic edition has exceeded our expectations we plan to launch zt online classic edition into open beta at the end of september considering that these changes are taking place in q3 it is difficult for us to have clear visibility into their potential financial impact as a result we will not be providing top line revenue guidance for q3 2008 however the co remains fundamentally sound and we believe our sequential growth in q4 2008 will be more in line with our historic track record
8397082 this highly conditional expression of interest attributed a 90 mln value to gold reserves equity which the board determined was inadequate and not in the best interests of shareholders for example the expression of interest did not take into account gold reserves current financial position and gave little value for our cos proven and probable reserves of 10 2 mln ounces of gold and 1 4 bln pounds of copper the mobile cat equipment the equipment currently being manufactured the extensive intangibles attached to the brisas project and the value of the choco 5 exploration property our objective is to enhance shareholder value and in that regard we are always willing to discuss any potential opportunities to achieve that objective
8397083 the cos decision to settle with midas now permanently resolves this matter and removes the cost and distraction of this litigation going forward gammon gold believes that the amount of the settlement is in the best interests of its shareholders in light of the cost and expense required to litigate in the united states gammon has and continues to deny any liability to midas

8397087 the companys development is on track and we are successfully achieving targeted milestones as part of the implementation of our current business plan
8397088 we are pleased with the progress achieved during the second quarter as we continued to see healthy demand and firm pricing the tight supply and higher costs for polysilicon and wafers constrained both our top and bottom line growth and our gross margins this is a temporary situation with visibility improving on both measures during the second half of 2008 most notably during the fourth quarter a number of important initiatives were completed following the close of the quarter which position us for continued growth going forward

8397094 we saw an increase in their confidence in the direction of the overall economy but that was offset by more owners saying theyre having cash flow issues
8397095 their perceptions of the conditions for their own businesses were flat making this gain harder to pin down there is still a great amount of caution out there
8397096 we know that some of the players are the same
8397097 we prepare because there are people who do not agree with political figures we know they are high profile and because of that they bring with them a certain amount of risk
8397098 we have to be prepare for that criminal intent for those who come to our area come to the convention really not to do anything other than break things and to possibly hurt people
8397099 im feeling very well prepared we have got a great staff put together
8397100 at least everyone arrested for protesting for exercising their first amendment right
8397101 platoons of police officers marching through the soft zone outside of the hard security zone forcing people to keep walking arresting people that are standing around and basically just being intimidators thats not the image that i think mn thinks of itself
8397102 our game is community policing we work in partnership with other law enforcement we work in partnership with the community to keep the peace and thats what st paul is about
8397103 we have a different style we think that our style will work better for st paul it will work better for our citizens in keeping with our culture and the culture of the midwest
8397104 this is continued evidence that the initiatives and programs to protect workers safety and health designed by and implemented in this administration are indeed working in addition to a decline in the overall number of fatalities the rate for 2007 declined to 3 7 fatalities per 100 000 workers this is the lowest fatality rate in recorded osha history

8397107 in the comic tradition some of these people are ruthless and a lot of them have super powers
8397108 this is where an employee says i am a construction worker or an electrician
8397109 sometimes an employee who works as an electricianat a school might think they are in the electrician category but they are actually in education
8397110 one thing we are looking at is whether the information we get from the industries is better than the information we get from the cbs
8397111 we are looking at different measurements to see which fits best that prediction of a dangerous job and which is better
8397112 if all else is equal if no other difference between two jobs is one is more dangerous you would expect higher pay that theory is not always true in practice
8397113 i am aggregating the data into smaller data sets that are easier to get a significant value
8397114 from my knowledge and not the data of this research there are a number of factors that influence pay danger skill respect that the job commands and dangerous jobs or undesirable jobs all factor into why people take a job danger is only one factor
8397115 it was tough in that sense i didnt have any problem with the cultural customs and food but i had a real difficulty with the english language
8397116 really appreciated those professors because they were very patient and encouraged me a lot
8397117 i couldnt say a minus b or a divided by b so i wrote on the blackboard or in my notebook and pointed it out
8397118 these explosions are very high temperature so we cant measure nuclear reaction rate correctly or it requires a lot of energy and it costs a lot
8397119 the experience gave me a lot of opportunities that i totally did not expect when i applied for it
8397120 even though i want to pursue astrophysics there is a lot of advanced math i need to study and i felt my background in math was weak i really wanted to build a real foundation in math
8397121 japanese universities require students to choose one department and they do not allow students to change their major i wanted to have options to explore my future career choices
8397122 right now i am studying real analysis later i will study theory analysis and another branch of analysis and integrals
8397123 i want to study theoretical astrophysics and the big bang theory
8397124 it will help me do a better job in whatever i will do it will help me build a strong foundation and help me leave my options open
8397125 learning to live on my own this summer was a test i soon realized that if i didnt go to the grocery store there wasnt going to be food
8397126 jobs can slow down the jobs may be connected together and if more than one job is trying to communicate with a given set of wires there is a network conflict and message passing conflict it is kind of a traffic jam
8397127 if there is a supercomputer with 100 processors and a job comes in that needs 90 processors and another job that needs 20 processors they cant both be done at the same time if the 90 processor job is running there are still 10 processors not being used and the supercomputer still has only 90 percent utilization this is less than the best utilization
8397128 they have these big machines that are sitting around and not doing much because we dont know how to allocate the jobs for the computers we are looking for better algorithms to make the process faster
8397129 if the supercomputers can perform more work they are worth more to the owner
8397130 it has a strong academic program and knox had the best computer science program
8397131 but it was my visit to knox that sealed the deal for me
8397132 i felt i would be challenged here i liked the community too i went out and listened to jazz within a few blocks of the campus
8397133 its just a wonderful gritty environment theres a sense of discovery
8397134 they had the large population the industrial living you had three and four families living in a dwelling
8397135 the strip district was an ideal place for us to start
8397136 there really arent many chain stores around here its like local mom and pop businesses and the strips kind of become like a gourmet foodie destination
8397137 people come down to get fresh ingredients and unique stuff and just to walk around
8397138 pittsburgh is a community town and thats why everybody that lives here loves it
8397139 pittsburgh isnt the type of town that you go to that has strip malls
8397140 i wanted to grow my hair long and stop wearing suits
8397141 culinary tours are really offered everywhere all of the big cities
8397142 so it was just a matter of time that pittsburgh needed to offer it as well
8397143 never a threat to any of the computers used for cmd and cntl and had no adverse effect on iss ops
8397144 most of the ip laptops and some of the payload laptops do not provide virus protection detection software
8397145 this is not the first time we have had a worm or a virus
8397146 its not a frequent occurrence but this isnt the first time

8397210 each morning i wake up and say to myself you have two choices today you can choose to be in a good mood or you can choose to be in a bad mood
8397211 life is all about choices when you cut away all the junk every situation is a choice you choose how you react to situations you choose how people affect your mood you choose to be in a good mood or bad mood the bottom line its your choice how you live your life
8397212 if i were any better id be twins wanna see my scars
8397213 the first thing that went through my mind was the well being of my soon to be born daughter
8397214 then as i lay on the ground i remembered that i had two choices i could choose to live or i could choose to die i chose to live
8397215 the paramedics were great they kept telling me i was going to be fine but when they wheeled me into the er and i saw the expressions on the faces of the doctors and nurses i got really scared in their eyes i read hes a dead man i knew i needed to take action
8397216 well there was a big burly nurse shouting questions at me
8397217 she asked if i was allergic to anything yes i replied
8397218 i am choosing to live operate on me as if i am alive not dead

8397220 yellowstone is located atop of one of the few large volcanic hotspots on earth
8397221 but though the hot material is a volcanic plume its cooler than others of its kind such as one in hawaii
8397222 although yellowstone sits above a plume of hot material coming up from deep with the earth its a remarkably lukewarm plume
8397223 it would be a mistake to write off yellowstone as a dead volcano a hot plume even a slightly cooler one is still hot

8397231 because seat belts can reduce the risk of injury and death in crashes by more than 50 there is a critical need for interventions to increase seat belt use by teens as both drivers and passengers
8397232 this research reinforces why state farm is actively involved in advocating for laws that help prevent injuries and deaths resulting from motor vehicle crashes its clear from these findings that primary seat belt laws for all occupants would help us accomplish that goal
8397233 anoles are highly visual species so in that sense its not surprising that they would use visual displays to mark territory
8397234 still the finding is surprising because these are the first animals known to use non acoustic signaling at dawn and dusk
8397235 these patterns have remarkable parallels with the dawn and dusk choruses reported for many acoustically communicating animals
8397236 the dawn chorus may be a way of communicating having survived the night
8397237 if in the morning a bird doesnt hear its neighbor or an anole doesnt see its neighbor it may be an opportunity for the animal to expand its territory
8397238 as in humans if an anole can do many of these push ups it shows that he is in prime physical condition these displays of strength help avert actual physical confrontations between male lizards which can be very fierce and destructive

8397241 in a strange coincidence to earths last eden good vs evil emerges as a major theme this season i think the audience will quickly identify with one group or the other
8397242 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8397243 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8397244 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8397245 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8397246 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer
8397247 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough
8397248 and berries are not enough we never get 100 percent tumor inhibition with berries so we need to think about another food that we can add to them that will boost the chemopreventive activities of berries alone

8397270 what has been proposed is too intense this is not a new york city block
8397271 we really felt that if it wasnt big and inclusive enough it wouldnt have the power to impact the change in america that we need at this time
8397272 its about trying to present some not so mainstream products using interesting breeds of pork
8397273 the two key points for me are its influence in keeping traditions and heritage intact as well as in helping us discover our cultural identities through food
8397274 i think the current issues that have emerged around energy food prices and water are going to create a powerful context in which change can emerge
8397275 we are clearly on the road to achieving our initial five year goals

8397277 i swear to you on my love for slipknot this is not a joke its the 100 truth
8397278 they shouldt change they should make another iowa im sure the next album will sound like the old ones
8397279 every album we have made is a statement about that space in time i think this era is the most mature most beautiful and the most powerful we have made an album that will show the road behind the road ahead and where we are as men i think its the best thing ive ever made and i challenge anyone to prove me wrong
8397280 when we were starting out we had all these strikes against us
8397281 we were from iowa there were nine of us we wore masks we wore coveralls we played metal hard metal
8397282 it was tough getting people to come out to des moines
8397283 i dont know why its a pretty cool place but a amp r dudes jaded folks from los angeles or new york its hard to get them to come to iowa
8397284 we also took a lot of shit from other bands
8397285 when we hit the road with ozzfest in 1999 i heard a lot of condescending remarks from other musicians they were saying
8397286 our music stood up were much more popular now and it wasnt because of our image it was the music
8397287 its our fourth album and we wanted to do something different
8397288 you cant put out the same record over and over again at the same time you can definitely still tell that this is slipknot
8397289 im looking forward to the expressions on peoples faces when they hear the new record
8397290 theres very very heavy stuff on this album and its gonna blow peoples minds but im also excited for them to see the stuff thats different on this album the more experimental music no ones going to expect it
8397291 i think everyone just went in with an open mind we would always listen to everyones ideas and if they worked they worked if they didnt they didnt
8397292 this time we really tried to build off the ideas really tried to work on them i think it helped that so many of us were able to spend time doing our own thing too just writing with different people really makes a difference in how you think about music when we finally came together we were able to bring that to the mix
8397293 it gave us more time and energy to experiment in the studio i was able to come up with more guitar sounds than ever
8397294 our shows were like sporting events wed put everything into them and then afterwards wed be fucking exhausted we werent going to pile into a van all nine of us and then drive all night to the next show wed have fallen asleep at the wheel and died
8397295 those early shows were rough but i loved the small stage
8397296 there was something intimate about it it was like an old school punk show which is what i grew up with
8397297 it was 8 000 degrees youre bumping into people youre tripping over equipment those small stages have low ceilings so the heats trapped real low right at your head those shows are about survival not about playing
8397298 shawn used to bring chop saws on stage to grind pipes for sparks
8397299 once a chunk broke off and sent a kid to the hospital but people who got hurt at our shows were cool about it wed follow them to the hospital and sign some shirts and shit it was like you know no harm no foul
8397300 wed be on tour and fire marshals would show up with camcorders and accuse us of all kinds of crazy bullshit theyd say we heard you set yourselves on fire
8397301 sid and clown would spray each other with lighter fluid and then theyd pull out lighters that got us in trouble one promoter would call the next theyd warn each other and theyd hit us with do not lists we were castrated
8397302 sometimes we hate each other sometimes we hate the world sometimes we just hate our own lives but when we get together something monstrous happens and we pull this amazing sound out of all that energy
8397303 we believe in world domination and this is the band thats gonna get us there
8397304 you know we went from being some local band in a basement to selling millions of records
8397305 its going to be a decade since the first album came out im so happy and amazed and proud and thankful for where this band has gone ive gotten to see the world and i get paid for it id have done it for free
8397306 i think the best part about being in this band has been getting exposure to the rest of the world you realize that everything in the world is the same people feel the same they have the same desires hopes fears being worldly is a gift that i dont ever want to give back it changes your life especially when youre from a small town in iowa
8397307 i always knew wed go far i just knew it
8397308 there was no way this band was going to fail but i never knew wed reach the heights weve come to weve traveled the world so many times all the different countries are like our second homes to this day it still blows me away that we took this crazy idea and made it a global sensation
8397309 every album we have made is a statement about that space in time i think this era is the most mature most beautiful and the most powerful we have made an album that will show the road behind the road ahead and where we are as men i think its the best thing ive ever made and i challenge anyone to prove me wrong

8397319 as i was putting him in the car i was wondering is it the engine noise that quiets the baby or the road noise we had no idea
8397320 we found out its probably the road noise and the motion
8397321 it didnt have much to do with the engine noise since theres no internal combustion engine

8397616 i think her message was supposed to be hey go with me and lets vote for barack there should have been a lot more emotive displays and we just simply did not see that
8397617 on when you see her i think a couple of times there when they were picturing her perhaps she was thinking this should be a little better and so forth but i think michelle was very receptive her non verbals actually were great at the beginning as she was you know you saw a lot of head tilt which is indicative of im receptive and so forth

8397651 his cerdas team has continually demonstrated industry leading expertise in the design implementation and evaluation of market research

8397665 it let me find a little bit of peace and discover who i was as a person

8397948 on august 9 a series of storms over the south okanagan resulted in a total rainfall of 48 3 millimeters in a single day that was a record breaking day in of itself
8397949 right now penticton is sitting at a total rainfall amount of 85 4 millimeters and the forecast for the next week is cool and unstable so there is a decent chance the record will be broken

8397968 it has been the highest honor to coach for the united states
8397969 i wouldnt trade it for a minute the experiences i have had through usa softball and more importantly the relationships i have made with athletes and staff are wonderful

8397971 hes going to wind his players up because he had a fall out with jeremy peace theres no love lost there
8397972 we have to be prepared for that and try and put a good performance in to try and win
8397973 i know a few people had problems with him but i thought he was okay
8397974 i know theres a few players who dont have a kind word to say about him but itll be nice to see him and hopefully take three points
8397975 we knew it would be difficult because olympiakos are a great team they have been in the champions league for the last 11 years but we came here and we held on and deserved to go through

8397977 around the country no judges are staying up late awaiting the final appeals from the condemned
8397978 governors and justices of the supreme court are not worrying that the person about to be executed may be the exceptional one who is innocent prison guards family members of victims and of death row inmates and even the media are relieved of the tension and uncertainty that each pending execution brings
8397979 but much of the death penalty system remains unaffected by this hold on executions
8397980 prosecutions trials appeals and the rituals of death row continue to absorb an enormous share of the judicial systems time and resources justices from some of the states highest courts have complained about the extraordinary strain this one issue places on the bench in many states there are not enough qualified lawyers willing to handle the appeals
8397981 the time for a dispassionate impartial comparison of the enormous costs that death penalty litigation imposes on society with the benefits that it produces has surely arrived

8397986 i think every team tried to put a little something different
8397987 they tried to stop our whole passing game but they gave up 300 yards on the ground
8397988 you can do that if you want to but well hurt you in a different kind of way

8398006 so those guys gray and lorenzen are both going to play well see how they do and then well determine whether we keep four three or two

8398013 slow strengthening is forecast once gustav moves away from haiti and the storm could regain hurricane strength within the next day or two
8398014 regardless of its predicted path it is important for citizens in the gulf coast region to listen to what their local officials are advising over the course of the next few days and to take these simple steps to prepare
8398015 if residents make individual and family preparations they make it easier for first responders to focus on people who cant help themselves and need help first
8398016 as long as there is a chance that well be in this storm ill be here in louisiana

8398057 president clinton will lay out the choices that we face on foreign policy
8398058 he will talk about how barack obama has what it takes to be a strong commander in chief
8398059 obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat
8398060 while barack obama recognizes that iran has been the biggest beneficiary of the war in iraq and that the bush mccain fear of tough diplomacy has allowed iran to spin 3800 centrifuges threaten israel and fund terrorism john mccain promises more of the same
8398061 if john mccain was serious about dealing with the threat from iran he would join barack obamas bipartisan effort in the senate to step up sanctions on iran instead of adopting the same tired old bush rove playbook
8398062 theres never a guarantee but im 100 percent ready i have my health now and im very optimistic

8398065 samuel is very strong hes the biggest puncher right now among the heavyweights thats why this is going to be an interesting fight
8398066 its two world champions two punchers lets meet in the ring and see who has the better skills
8398067 we will aggressively prosecute individuals and companies who line their own pockets by corrupting the bidding process for base procurement in afghanistan
8398068 these contracts were meant to protect u s soldiers serving their country and we will not tolerate corruption that deprives the troops of the benefits of competitively sourced goods and services
8398069 this case clearly demonstrates the effective cooperation between dod investigative agencies and the shared dedication and fortitude our agents in the field have in pursuing these cases and bringing the guilty parties to justice
8398070 anyone who is contemplating putting themselves in a position where their selfishness and greed overtakes their honor and sense of duty to the nation and taxpayers they serve should beware we will continue to thoroughly and doggedly investigate these types of allegations and the findings will be turned over to the appropriate entity for prosecution
8398071 americas warfighters deserve the very best to perform their jobs and the taxpayers expect nothing less bribery and corruption within the military not only takes away precious dollars necessary for the dedicated american warfighter but it undermines the confidence of the american public who demand a military procurement system that spends their tax dollars wisely and responsibly this investigation should serve as a warning for those intent on defrauding the u s military and american public that the defense criminal investigative service dcis will pursue these crimes relentlessly

8398078 he hasnt come in expecting anything just because of what he did in high school
8398079 hes shown me and the rest of the guys that hes gonna earn his position earn his spot and so far hes done that every day
8398080 hes real laid back hes cool on and off the field we hang out all the time this past weekend we just kicked it together hes a humble guy
8398081 hes a great athlete a great guy both on and off the field
8398082 some people have got it some people dont hes one who has it
8398083 hes consistently made plays in practice and in both scrimmages
8398084 after the first scrimmage it was pretty evident that he was going to have some role as one of the three receivers that we use quite a bit
8398085 this last week he certainly solidified his position as the starter he and mike mccoy have been our two best receivers throughout this camp
8398086 they thought he was going to be but hes a hard worker
8398087 hes not out boasting about what hes going to do he just lets his actions speak louder than his words

8398094 what it does mean is people can come together respecting each others point of view and share power and make sure politics is only expressed through peaceful and democratic means and in that it will give the people of northern ireland the future they want and give heart to all of us who have wanted this process over the past few years now at last we have a date certain for a remarkable coming together of people who have for very obvious reasons been strongly opposed in the past

8398118 the animating principle of my faith as taught to me by church and home was that the cardinal sin was abuse of power
8398119 it was not only required as a good catholic to abhor and avoid abuse of power but to do something to end that abuse
8398120 i get comfort from carrying my rosary going to mass every sunday its my time alone
8398121 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
8398122 a person who procures a completed abortion incurs excommunication latae sententiae
8398123 there are those who say that catholics should be robots theres a formula and if we dont follow that formula we shouldnt present ourselves for communion on sunday morning says chris korzen executive director of catholics united
8398124 if i were an ordained priest id be taking some issue with some of the more narrow interpretations of the gospel being taken now
8398125 but my church is more than 2 000 years old theres always been a tug of war among prelates and informed lay members
8398126 but shrugs off the abortion debate as a minor controversy
8398127 if i were an ordained priest id be taking some issue with some of the more narrow interpretations of the gospel being taken now
8398128 the animating principle of my faith as taught to me by church and home was that the cardinal sin was abuse of power
8398129 the animating principle of my faith as taught to me by church and home was that the cardinal sin was abuse of power
8398130 it was not only required as a good catholic to abhor and avoid abuse of power but to do something to end that abuse
8398131 the animating principle of my faith as taught to me by church and home was that the cardinal sin was abuse of power
8398132 i represent all members of my congressional district or state for slow joe and have to consider what is the right thing for all of them
8398133 on that issue my personal position differs from the church

8398138 we find that the cost of capturing co2 with the complete system would fall between 80 and 250 t co2 and improvements are suggested which reduce the upper bound cost to 130 t co2 even at the high calculated cost air capture has implications for climate policy however dedicated engineering and technological innovation have potential to produce much lower cost systems
8398139 new technology that i do not understand will save us
8398140 as noted the models do not consider the possibility of an equilibration of the climate with a steady increase in aerosol as would actually occur thus the modeling is deficient in addressing this important reality
8398141 with interest i follow when capturing co2 from the air will be the lowest cost system
8398142 does this mean you support a carbon tax of up to 250 ton co2 to pay for it
8398143 there is no hard evidence that aerosol geoengineering would a result in dangerous reductions in stratospheric ozone or b lead to harmful acid precipitation
8398144 there is no linear predictability in terms of how ecosystems respond the phenomena of collapse is one that we have under appreciated partly because of the feed back mechanisms that we are still trying to understand
8398145 leemans and eickhout 2004 found that adaptive capacity decreases rapidly with an increasing rate of climate change their study finds that five percent of all ecosystems cannot adapt more quickly than 0 1 c per decade over time forests will be among the ecosystems to experience problems first because their ability to migrate to stay within the climate zone they are adapted to is limited if the rate is 0 3 c per decade 15 percent of ecosystems will not be able to adapt if the rate should exceed 0 4 c per decade all ecosystems will be quickly destroyed opportunistic species will dominate and the breakdown of biological material will lead to even greater emissions of co2 this will in turn increase the rate of warming
8398146 another reason for concern regional and global impacts on ecosystems for different levels of climate change
8398147 few seem to realise that the present ipcc models predict almost unanimously that by 2040 the average summer in europe will be as hot as the summer of 2003 when over 30 000 died from heat by then we may cool ourselves with air conditioning and learn to live in a climate no worse than that of baghdad now but without extensive irrigation the plants will die and both farming and natural ecosystems will be replaced by scrub and desert what will there be to eat the same dire changes will affect the rest of the world and i can envisage americans migrating into canada and the chinese into siberia but there may be little food for any of them
8398148 peak temperatures may rise twice as fast as average temperatures as climate change hots up
8398149 again i refer to the total abstention from other future possibilities although all the concerns deal with possible futures please see again goettmann fr d ric arne thomas and markus antonietti 2007 metal free activation of co2 by mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride angewandte chemie vol 46 no 15 pp 2717 2720 april 2 2007 if needed the future solution is e g this artificial photosynthesis besides nature and man gets the extra biomass urgently needed the main message is that human ingenuity will resolve this co2 problem if it exists at all
8398150 a much discussed idea to offset global warming by injecting sulfate particles into the stratosphere would have a drastic impact on earths protective ozone layer new research concludes the study led by simone tilmes of the national center for atmospheric research ncar in boulder colo warns that such an approach would delay the recovery of the antarctic ozone hole by decades and cause significant ozone loss over the arctic
8398151 the economics of geoengineering are there is no better word for it incredible according to teller et al 2003 5 engineered particles would be even cheaper mainly because of the reduced volume of material that would need to be put into the stratosphere they estimate that the sunlight scattering needed to offset the warming effect of rising greenhouse gas concentrations by the year 2100 would cost just 1 billion per year
8398152 the greens resistance to geo engineering sits very uncomfortably with its message that the planet is screwed and were all going to die it suggests that they dont actually believe their own press releases and that they know the situation is not as dire as they would like the rest of us to think it is it suggests that environmentalists regard science and engineering as the cause of problems and not the solution
8398153 i hope i never need a parachute but if my plane is going down in flames i sure hope i have a parachute handy
8398154 i hope well never need geoengineering schemes but if a climate catastrophe occurs i sure hope we will have thought through our options carefully
8398155 methadone is a pretty good metaphor kind of like saccharine sugarless sodas and decaf coffee not really facing the problem
8398156 we all know that we have to convert all coal fired power plants to nuclear worldwide by 2015 but it wont happen because the average american has an irrational fear of all things nuclear
8398157 measurements from space since the 1970s give a global annual earth albedo of 0 29 the average incident solar radiative flux is 341 w m 2 so that a change in albedo of 0 01 represents a global energy balance change of 3 4 w m 2 similar in magnitude to the impact of doubling carbon dioxide in the atmosphere global albedo can change with changes in earths cloud fractional coverage cloud thickness aerosol amount forest cover or snow and ice cover for example a 2 year change in albedo was caused by the large mount pinatubo volcanic eruption in june 1991 stratospheric aerosols from the eruption increased global albedo by up to 0 007 because of the reflection of an additional 2 5 w m 2 of solar radiation over the following 2 years
8398158 its not the whole biosphere at risk here except for very human centric definitions of biosphere its mostly the charismatic megafauna that are in trouble if you include people as charismatic debatable yes
8398159 all we have to do to destroy the planets climate and its biota and leave a ruined world to our children and grandchildren is to just keep on where were going today just keep releasing greenhouse gases at current rates just keep degrading and homogenizing and destroying our biological resources just continue releasing toxic chemicals at current rates and by the latter part of this century the world wont be fit to live in

8398165 i fail to understand why sequestering massive amounts of carbon fails to be geo engineering
8398166 w edwards deming the great statistician and management theorist showed that a lack of understanding of a system led invariably to its tweaking
8398167 basically i am wondering how energy intensive grinding up rock is it cant be too intensive for coal or else it wouldnt be useful as an energy source but im guessing coal is a bit softer than granite or basalt
8398168 some discussion here has referred to the olivine dispersal idea
8398169 the system is our planets biosphere and tweaking it may very well lead as deming warned to sub optimization decay and the eventual destruction of the system the fact that such ideas as geo engineering are being given such serious discussion is troubling

8398175 the government coalition is made up of parties whose leadership has been implicated in the parapolitics scandal the parties presidents are under prosecution and between 30 and 70 percent of the votes the parties won are compromised because the legislators are either on trial or in jail
8398176 a governing coalition that has won power by the use of violence they share the responsibility for the appalling crimes for which the paramilitaries are being tried
8398177 how will impunity be avoided and what kind of reparations will be demanded of the parapoliticians who contributed to murders massacres and the forced displacement of three million people in colombia
8398178 how will the trial of those most responsible for crimes under the jurisdiction of the icc including political leaders and members of congress presumably linked to demobilised groups be ensured
8398179 the parapolitics scandal is a key issue for us because those who are ultimately responsible should be tried and convicted
8398180 in which mechanisms of armed pressure and territorial control were used which can be linked to crimes against humanity
8398181 parapolitics is the main front in the struggle today in colombia

8398189 the board will continue to work closely with dan and his management team to guide the company and support the housing finance system through a very challenging period
8398190 this team will be responsible for meeting the dual objectives of conserving capital and controlling credit losses while fannie mae continues to provide crucial liquidity to the u s housing and mortgage markets
8398191 this was probably a necessary step but not one thats going to determine the future of fannie mae clearly the fate of fannie and freddie is in the hands of policymakers

8398233 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8398234 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8398235 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8398236 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8398237 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8398238 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8398290 i love the smell of total desperation in the morning
8398291 and speaking of the mccain camp remember when one time bush media guru and mccain champion mark mckinnon decided to step away from the 08 campaign once it became clear obama would be the dem nominee well hes back sort of per nbcs kelly odonnell mckinnons helping cindy mccain with her convention week prep including a family video when pressed the campaign acknowledged that while mckinnon is largely on the strategic sidelines he does provide occasional advice on the campaign ad efforts
8398292 thats all no video no ads nothing else and nothing beyond that i think that squares with my pledge i always said i would remain fan friend and cheerleader and i have not been providing advice on ad efforts period
8398293 nbcs kelly odonnell reports on the return of mark mckinnon to the mccain fold at least for mccain week

8398307 some days when you come down in the area my eyes water and i sneeze
8398308 shipping pollution is basically one of the last regulated or lightly regulated frontiers
8398309 there are about 50 000 ocean going ships around the world
8398310 the air pollution is extremely toxic and can produce substantial health effects in humans such as asthma lung cancer heart attacks and even premature deaths
8398311 it is going to affect things like tugboats and some of the ferries that are out there
8398312 we think it will make a substantial difference again every little piece that we cover is one less piece that needs to be covered in the future

8398333 patient safety is always our paramount concern and so we have immediately responded to the recommendation of the idmc we are currently notifying all participating clinical trial sites and regulatory agencies that enrollment of new patients into vital 2 has been suspended as has treatment with gvax immunotherapy for prostate cancer of patients enrolled in the study
8398334 notwithstanding this disappointing outcome we would like to acknowledge the courage and commitment of the patients and physicians who have participated in this trial
8398335 the observation in the vital 2 trial is very surprising to us and we have therefore asked the idmc to conduct a previously unplanned futility analysis of vital 1 in order to determine the overall prospects for our ongoing development program for this product moreover with the cessation of vital 2 we expect to make commensurate adjustments to our business operations and we will provide further details regarding this in the near future as a reminder the company ended the second quarter of 2008 with 166 million in cash
8398336 at amylin and lilly patient safety is our foremost concern we are committed to continuing to work closely with the fda to ensure that physicians and patients are provided with accurate information about any potential risks associated with the use of our products
8398337 it is important to understand that pancreatitis an inflammatory condition of the pancreas is a rare event further the characteristics and complications of the pancreatitis cases in patients on byetta are consistent with pancreatitis in the general population we believe byetta continues to have a positive benefit risk profile for patients with type 2 diabetes

8398340 it is clear based on yesterdays ruling that the lawsuit by taros independent directors was part of a calculated effort by barry levitt to avoid living up to his obligations under the option agreement it is time for dr levitt and his family to live up to the contract and do what is required of them under the option agreement
8398341 these shareholders benefited from suns investment which basically saved taro from collapse
8398342 the final guidance is excellent news for patients with wet amd who are in need of access to this highly effective treatment
8398343 wet amd is a debilitating disease that can rapidly lead to loss of vision and all too often to loss of independence and quality of life for patients when fully implemented the nice decision will ensure that patients have access to lucentis for as long as they need to preserve or improve their vision
8398344 we are committed to working in partnership with health authorities to ensure that as many patients as possible with wet amd can benefit from treatment with lucentis
8398345 this reimbursement scheme is an important collaboration that will ensure patients living with wet amd in england and wales receive the best possible care
8398346 the dramatic clinical results from this study of gleevec in the adjuvant gist setting are especially encouraging when we consider the incremental benefit we typically see with other adjuvant therapies for solid tumors

8398384 its unfortunate that only a third or less of consumers say they have a great deal or quite a lot of trust in the industries included in the survey

8398387 the fact that they have referenced blu ray in their publicity has put the cat among the proverbial pigeons because the blu ray standard was always intended to be untouchable as a video quality industry benchmark the blu ray disc association is fighting back with claims that satellite companies cannot technically match the blu ray experience and that it will do whatever it can to ensure that consumers are not being misled
8398388 these comparisons are irresponsible and are misleading to consumers upconversion and satellite broadcast cannot provide a true blu ray high definition experience as neither is technically capable of producing the quality delivered by blu ray players and blu ray discs to that end the blu ray disc association is exploring these claims further and will take appropriate action as necessary to prevent consumers seeking the ultimate in high definition home entertainment from being misled
8398389 der friedensprozess wird nicht von irgendwelchen siedlungsaktivit ten beeintr chtigt und sollte es auch nicht werden letzten endes reden wir ber die zuk nftigen grenzen des pal stinensischen staates mehr als 40 jahre lang haben wir mehr oder weniger ber dieselben sieldungsbl cke geredet und dies ist ein teil der verhandlungen ich verstehe dass das mitunter verschiedene teile der pal stinensischen gesellschaft tangiert aber letztendlich so habe ich es auch meinen gespr chspartnern auf der pal stinensischen seite dargelegt besteht die rolle der politischen f hrung darin zu versuchen einen weg zu finden um zuk nftig in frieden zu leben und nicht darin jedwedes ger usch das mit der situation vor ort zu tun hat in das verhandlungszimmer eindringen zu lassen auch f r mich k nnte es leichter sein einige vorw nde anzuf hren und zu sagen dass bestimmte ereignisse meine verhandlungsf higkeit beintr chtigen aber ich habe mich entschieden dies nicht zu tun selbst in den h rteren tagen des terrors ich m chte also meinen verhandlungspartnern nahe legen dies nicht als vorwand zu benutzen
8398390 wir m ssen uns auch vergegenw rtigen wo wir vor einem jahr gestanden haben als wir terroranschl ge ausgesetzt waren und die situation im gaza streifen zu einer art verst ndnis gef hrt hat dass es keine hoffnung auf frieden gebe wir haben den annapolis prozess gestartet es findet nun ein dialog zwischen israel und den diplomatischen wortf hrern auf der pal stinensischen seite statt es gibt eine hoffnung auf frieden der die interessen beider seiten repr sentieren kann dies ist nicht weniger wichtig ich finde manchmal sollten wir uns daran erinnern dass wir die atmosph re ver ndert haben die situation vor ort

8398394 we are not a superpower we dont have to respond to every event in the world
8398395 we have discussed the importance of reaching complete and comprehensive solutions not partial solutions
8398396 we shouldnt lose another seven years searching for solutions we hope the new administration will continue what we have begun and what we have reached these efforts havent been for nothing we would have stopped it if it was pointless there are benefits that i hope will show in the future

8398403 we had a hard fought contest in kentucky like we did all across the country and people feel very passionate about their candidates but everybody i think is ready to come together now and get behind our ticket in the fall and really go after this election and push him across the finish line
8398404 another benefit of this convention is bringing together leading democrats from across kentucky and getting them pulled together and pushing forward on all the other races we have in the state
8398405 our united states senate race is a very winnable race with bruce lunsford
8398406 we can pick up a congressional seat with david boswell in 2nd district and i am finding a lot of enthusiasm for both of those races here
8398407 this is a very exciting one obviously because of the historic juncture were at in this country the fact that tonight we are going to nominate the first african american for president of the united states
8398408 im very comfortable that by getting people at a national level to pay attention to this race when it tightens down in the end well be able to get some support nationwide that will really help us
8398409 the doctors are very careful not to let concerns about vitamin d deficiency discourage women from breastfeeding

8398420 i havent spent the last 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights here at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house no way no how no mccain
8398421 this wont be easy progress never is but it will be impossible unless we put a democrat in the white house
8398422 in 2008 he still thinks its ok that women dont earn equal pay with an agenda like that its no wonder george w bush and john mccain will be together in the twin cities next week its awfully hard to tell them apart we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare

8398434 its important to him that native portrayals are accurate and respectful
8398435 we all care a lot about history and want to share our love of history with enthusiasm and authenticity
8398436 his character is a revolutionary war veteran who lost his leg in battle
8398437 he shows the british musket ball to anyone who asks he also made his characters peg leg on the lathe in his shop
8398438 i portray a veteran like you would have met out in the northwest territory more than 200 years ago this area was distributed as land grants to veterans this was a land of opportunity for veterans from the revolution
8398439 we try to educate people about native americans culture not just the warrior culture but ordinary village life

8398441 the election of 1800 was a hard fought battle between john adams and thomas jefferson

8398445 if children are going to learn about our heritage it will be at quality events like the fair at new boston where we work hard at accuracy and authenticity
8398446 one of the things i hear over and over again is that local people have no idea of the amazing historical events that happened right here in the miami valley
8398447 this was and is a fascinating place to live while we demonstrate the difficulties of settling in a wilderness at our event we hope that visitors will also see the joys of the lifestyles our ancestors lived and their enthusiasm for this new country

8398468 we know as players we have let ourselves down as well as the manager gary megson the staff and the fans

8398472 newcastle united can confirm that it has received a written transfer request from james milner
8398473 the club is very disappointed that james sees his footballing future as being away from st james park

8398475 there was kevin keegan telling the press how great a performance he thought this player had delivered on tuesday night when the person in question was getting ready to tell his manager and the board that he no longer wanted to be plying his trade at newcastle

8398529 one approach to restore auditory function is to replace defective cells with healthy new cells
8398530 our work shows that it is possible to produce functional auditory hair cells in the mammalian cochlea
8398531 it remains to be determined whether gene transfer into a deaf mouse will lead to the production of healthy cells that enable hearing however we have made an important step toward defining an approach that may lead to therapeutic intervention for hearing loss

8398728 because of speculation among scientists that viral infections provoke the inflammation that increases the risk of macular degeneration we tested for associations between amd and tlr3 which is known to support innate immunity and host defense
8398729 if you are genetically susceptible to macular degeneration and are exposed to a virus that activates tlr3 it could lead to the death of cells in the macula
8398730 ironically in some individuals using rnai to cure wet amd might actually increase the risk for blindness from dry amd
8398731 these findings pave the way for using tlr3 inhibitors as a potential new therapy for dry amd and simultaneously highlight the importance of critically assessing the potential risk posed to patients by rnai based therapies
8398732 what tlr3 does in the case of perceived infection is to sacrifice infected cells in this case retinal pigment epithilial cells to protect the neighborhood
8398733 biologically well intentioned though the sacrifice may be it can lead to blindness
8398734 given its high prevalence in the united states and the world finding effective prevention and treatment strategies for amd is of critical importance this finding represents a major advancement in our understanding of dry amd for which effective treatment is not yet available

8398759 one of the several issues that was of considerable importance to me was veterans and military families

8398763 i expected greatness and we got greatness i expected a powerful document and we got a powerful document

8398808 some of the early church fathers held that abortion was homicide others that it was tantamount to homicide and various scholars theorized about when and how the unborn child might be animated or ensouled but none diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide in short from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
8398809 the current teaching of the catholic church on human life and abortion is the same teaching as it was 2 000 years ago from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the moment of conception to natural death
8398810 this all has been made too big a deal of

8398813 the problem is that if you happen to be an individual who has the wrong genetic code in tlr3 you might inadvertently trigger a detrimental effect in your retina
8398814 you might cure the individual of one thing and increase their risk in something else
8398815 this discovery has significant implications for diagnosing the dry form of amd which is the most prevalent form affecting more than 8 million americans
8398816 it also allows us to develop new drugs to treat the dry form of amd for which there currently is no treatment
8398817 what tlr3 does in the case of infection is sacrifice an infected cell to protect the neighborhood
8398818 you and me we have a good 20 to 30 percent chance of getting macular degeneration
8398819 so when the time comes for us to start thinking about intervention we might want to get genotyped first and then decide what kind of therapeutic paradigm might be most appropriate for us
8398820 if we can figure out which viruses might be acting as triggers we might be able to find a way to combat them this would be a far more effective therapy in my view than trying to design a gene therapy approach

8398841 everyone was asking me before what it was going to be like i was like i dont know i havent talked to her in 10 or 15 years i had that tension and i started to let it get to me is she going to be nice is it going to be a bad environment but when i saw her everything was fine
8398842 i think when youre 18 your personalities conflict then you meet up 10 or 15 years later and the playing ground is totally different and youre fine
8398843 it let me find a little bit of peace and discover who i was as a person
8398844 not the person who the press made me out to be because id had a few bad experiences in my personal life and i was struggling to figure out a bad husband or a bad boyfriend and i was doing it under the spotlight so i wasnt reacting well to any of it
8398845 i dont think we ever hit each other scratching im not going to deny that

8398857 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play

8398859 how do you tell a warrior to sit down thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
8398860 obviously it was a big relief for a lot of us we all know what shawne brings to this team especially the defense
8398861 hes an impact player a difference maker you just kept your fingers crossed that he was going to be able to play but i think in the back of all our minds knowing shawne we know what was in his heart and that he really wanted to play and that any cost possible he was going to find a way to get out there on that field
8398862 we are heading out to the build site where we are building four homes with habitat for humanity through the jimmie johnson foundation its an exciting day my wife and i are all dressed up and ready to have a good day
8398863 some weekends i feel like we have a dominant car and other weekends i feel like were a fifth place car or even a 10th place car
8398864 with the strong team that we have we seem to be able to rally back and get finishes out of it so i still think that we may be behind and especially where we want to be we want a nice cushion and we want to be well ahead of the competition and without a doubt we are not there
8398865 we are on par if maybe just not a little bit behind right now we have been testing already this week and been working as hard as we possibly can to find more speed and to better understand this car every time we are on track we learn something and we can apply it
8398866 im excited for this weekends race and we were a little smarter yesterday in the test session that we had and hopefully we can bring that out to california this weekend
8398867 we showed up at vegas and fontana at the start of the season with what we thought was the best downforce package on the planet
8398868 california went well we were slow all weekend but went with the 24 of jeff gordons setup and it ran well then we went to vegas with the latest greatest moves and the stuff we thought was going to work based on the old car and we were not even in the same race we were out there seven cylinder class it seemed like that has been the hardest part to find out where to work and thats what weve done all season long
8398869 there is not anyone smarter than chad but the way he has thought about setting these cars up and what we have done in the past does not work with this new car
8398870 we are trying to find the right direction in the right areas to turn him loose and let him work there are not any big areas anymore its a lot of small areas and we are now i feel getting the rhythm of this car and understanding what to work on
8398871 its a lot closer to equal to what we have now so i think its a great opportunity
8398872 we get into the final 10 and its great tracks for myself and the 48 team
8398873 you look bristol wasnt a good one for us and then whatever was before i guess michigan those two races and even parts of michigan we were the fastest car on the track but its amazing how momentum shifts from week to week we were not on the radar last week you look at the weeks before that the win at indy and what we have done at pocono we have a lot of forward momentum and progress with this race team and i feel like we are one of the guys to be considered a favorite in the championship and look forward to getting started
8398874 so to see celebrities that people think so highly of and dont think ever have any flaws you get to see them totally out of their element mess up and get frustrated and look silly you know theyre human i think people like that

8398909 acest fenomen este explicabil daca ne gandim atat la specificul activitatii farmaceutice si fmcg precum si la dezvoltarea puternica din ultimii ani indeosebi sectorul financiar tendinta este similara si la nivel european unde cele mai mari venituri per fte sunt in sectorul serviciilor financiare
8398910 daca romania ar putea fi comparata cu restul statelor din regiune preturile terenurilor in momentul de fata ar trebui sa fie de trei patru ori mai mici in timp ce chiriile ar trebui sa fie si ele cu aproximativ 20 mai mici desi exista inca destule terenuri disponibile in locatii bune in bucuresti cat si in restul tarii proprietarii acestora le trateaza ca si cum ar fi la fel de rare ca si cele din manhattan new york
8398911 am dezvoltat birouri pentru ibm in budapesta si m nchen pentru pwc in praga dar costurile din romania depasesc logica mediei din europa centrala si de est
8398912 raportat la ceea ce se poate construi in romania preturile pe metrul patrat construibil de pe piata locala sunt comparabile cu alte tari din europa centrala si de est dar in timp ce preturile terenurilor pot fi justificate prin dezvoltarea unor suprafete largi acest lucru limiteaza totusi posibilitatea investitorilor de a si diminua riscurile fiind fortati catre proiecte de mari dimensiuni in locatii unice
8398913 nu este posibil ca toate costurile aflate in crestere precum terenul sau constructia sa fie transferate catre utilizatorul final iar marja dezvoltatorului a proprietarului de teren sau a firmei de constructii sa ramana la acelasi nivel aceste costuri vor trebui redistribuite daca la fel s ar intampla si pe piata de birouri chiriile ar trebui sa creasca la randul lor dar acest lucru este greu de imaginat
8398914 am inceput sa invatam ce chirii se pot obtine aici ce companii cauta birouri si in ce zone ne vom orienta catre zona de centru nord unde analizam doua loturi de teren apreciem ca pentru urmatoarele 18 24 de luni inchirierile vor ramane la un nivel ridicat la nivelul bucurestiului
8398915 lucrul pozitiv pe care l am remarcat a fost ca nu au mai crescut preturile dar in cazul loturilor bune acestea nu au scazut deocamdata speram ca pe fondul crizei financiare lucrurile se vor calma si in romania desi piata este mult mai dificila
8398916 principalul obiectiv in momentul de fata este sa finalizam cladirea la timp ceea ce este destul de dificil pe piata locala despre ce vom face ulterior cu cladirea vom discuta cu partenerul nostru dar obiectivul actual este finalizarea cladirii
8398917 suntem in total 12 angajati aig lincoln in romania incluzand divizia de property management iar strategia este de crestere a echipei
8398918 este mult mai scump sa iei un credit de la o banca locala avem dificultati cu o serie de banci din sud estul europei in sensul ca ne impun anumite termene si garantii pe care nu le putem accepta cu toate acestea finantarea prin credite este extrem de importanta pentru raportul dintre componenta equity si leverage astfel ca incercam sa imprumutam cat mai mult
8398919 ne ar placea sa construim si sa avem in dezvoltare pana in 2012 patru proiecte de valori apropiate ca investitie cu cea din lakeview adica un cost total de aproximativ 200 de milioane de euro
8398920 nu este obisnuit pentru noi sa intram in parteneriate si nu suntem un fond suntem o companie de dezvoltare destul de flexibila in ciuda caracterului institutional al actionarilor astfel au putut incepe discutiile cu fabian in 2006 sunt multe companii institutionale care inca refuza sa vina in europa de est din cauza riscurilor
8398921 piata de retail este bine ocupata in ceea ce priveste proiectele aflate pe hartie dar inca nu a fost stabilit cine vor fi cei care vor pierde piata va trece prin momente grele pe masura ce inflatia creste iar puterea de cumparare scade in prezent pretul terenurilor impune dezvoltarea unor malluri cu mai multe etaje in timp ce noi preferam proiectele pe un singur nivel
8398922 i share my mistakes some things i shouldnt have released now if you look at music today its perfect the videos are perfect the people are perfect the songs are perfect til the end the visuals are glossy and everything is mixed so well i put out demos were not perfect as people and i put out my mistakes and blemishes and things some artists wouldnt want to show about themselves we all want to be perceived as being cool especially for musicians im clumsy i bump into things i have bad relationships with girls im not totally honest sometimes i think people see that in my music as imperfect music for imperfect people i think they like the fact that i put my warts and scars out there
8398923 she told him they played my music in a childrens burn unit if i can touch a few souls everything else theres not a lot i like about myself but thats the only pure part of me to get into peoples souls
8398924 these measures will send a clear message to the world canada takes its responsibilities seriously for environmental protection and enforcement in our arctic waters

8398926 the danger is when that congress reconvenes they will be anxious to leave and go back home and campaign
8398927 my guess is theyre going to adjourn in september if they dont vote then the democrats as magninamous as they have been in the past will put this issue aside will say let bygones be bygones lets get on with this agenda to heal the wounds of this past administration and karl rove will be given his getaway pass thumbing his nose at our constitution congress and the american people
8398928 using the department of justice as a political weapon to strike out at those people he considered to be enemies of this administration
8398929 if congress passes the contempt citation it will put pressure on all of his right wing extremist accomplices who have conspired with him if congress lets him off none of these other people will feel any pressure to come forward with the truth

8398938 i ceased to advertise my mothers race at the age of twelve or thirteen when i began to suspect that by doing so i was ingratiating myself to whites
8398939 i found solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mothers race
8398940 to avoid being mistaken for a sellout i chose my friends carefully the more politically active black students the foreign students the chicanos the marxist professors and structural feminists
8398941 i learned to slip back and forth between my black and white worlds one of those tricks i had learned people were satisfied so long as you were courteous and smiled and made no sudden moves they were more than satisfied they were relieved such a pleasant surprise to find a well mannered young black man who didnt seem angry all the time
8398942 i had learned not to care i blew a few smoke rings remembering those years pot had helped and booze maybe a little blow when you could afford it not smack though
8398943 ive got two daughters 9 years old and 6 years old i am going to teach them first of all about values and morals but if they make a mistake i dont want them punished with a baby
8398944 i can no more disown jeremiah wright than i can disown the black community
8398945 the point i was making was not that grandmother harbors any racial animosity she doesnt but she is a typical white person
8398946 you go into some of these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothings replaced them and they fell through the clinton administration and the bush administration and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not and its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
8398947 we need somebody whos got the heart the empathy to recognize what its like to be a young teenage mom the empathy to understand what its like to be poor or african american or gay or disabled or old and thats the criterion by which ill be selecting my judges
8398948 for the first time in my adult life i am proud of my country because it feels like hope is making a comeback
8398949 that is why i am here because barack obama is the only person in this who understands that that before we can work on the problems we have to fix our souls our souls are broken in this nation
8398950 barack is one of the smartest people you will ever encounter who will deign to enter this messy thing called politics
8398951 as a black man you know barack can get shot going to the gas station you know
8398952 my experiences at princeton have made me far more aware of my blackness than ever before
8398953 earlier in my college career there was no doubt in my mind that as a member of the black community i was somehow obligated to this community and would utilize all of my present and future resources to benefit this community
8398954 racism is how this country america was founded and how this country is still run
8398955 america is still the number one killer in the world
8398956 we americans are deeply involved in the importing of drugs the exporting of guns and the training of professional killers we believe in white supremacy and black inferiority and believe it more than we believe in god we conducted radiation experiments on our own people we care nothing about human life if the ends justify the means
8398957 we have supported state terrorism against the palestinians and black south africans and now we are indignant because the stuff we have done overseas is now brought right back to our own front yards americas chickens are coming home to roost
8398958 the government gives them the drugs builds bigger prisons passes a three strike law and then wants us to sing god bless america no no no god damn america thats in the bible for killing innocent people god damn america for treating our citizens as less than human god damn america for as long as she acts like she is god and she is supreme
8398959 in the 21st century white america got a wake up call after 9 11 01 white america and the western world came to realize that people of color had not gone away faded into the woodwork or just disappeared as the great white west kept on its merry way of ignoring black concerns
8398960 racism is how this country was founded and how this country is still run no black man will ever be considered for president no matter how hard you run jesse jackson and no black woman can ever be considered for anything outside what she can give with her body

8398999 we have great control of land and infrastructure in this area expertise gained from our quebec shale play has allowed us to re evaluate our past results we believe we have been able to correlate the results to particular shale qualities which greatly encourage us that a predictive model can be created the very high gas in place numbers and promising production results from our two wells in the liard shales make this test very interesting
8399000 we are excited about the prospects of the liard basin shale and we see the similarities to the horn river shale the license has six existing well bores the surface infrastructure and the export line that all add significant commercial advantage we also see the value in the continuation of the development of the upper shales which have produced strongly over the past two years and believe this work program will highlight the shale commerciality in the liard basin

8399009 de la sfarsitul anilor 90 arin octav stanescu arie shalev a participat activ la lichidarea mai multor societati comerciale sau bancare importante intre care banca internationala a religiilor bankcoop bancile albina si fortuna societatea de asigurari metropol s a a fost acuzat in repetate randuri de insusirea unor parti importante ale patrimoniului acestora de instrainarea unor imobile catre terti la preturi mult mai mici decat cele reale precum si de insusirea ilegala a unor imense sume de bani din conturile acelorasi societati contra serviciilor prestate ca lichidator
8399010 in cadrul scandalului bir pavalache s a acreditat teoria conform careia insusi arin octav stanescu a fost de fapt la originea demascarii fostului consilier guvernamental dar in interes propriu si nu intru eradicarea coruptiei dupa cum se stie mita pretinsa de acesta de la persoane din fosta conducere a bir ar fi urmat sa se afle la baza inlaturarii lichidatorului bancii mai precis la inlaturarea de la administrarea bir a societatii de lichidare conduse de stanescu toti cei care au facilitat contactele dintre fanel pavalache si cei interesati de inlaturarea lichidatorului au fost persoane din anturajul lui arin octav stanescu asadar acesta a putut evita la timp si extrem de eficace ca bir al carei patrimoniu era foarte valoros sa dispara de pe lista societatilor aflate in lichidarea sau supravegherea sa in acest context este cunoscut faptul ca denuntatorii lui fanel pavalache sunt tocmai persoanele care stabilisera contactul dintre acesta si fostul presedinte al bir ion popescu cel putin in privinta bir stanescu shalev a putut astfel continua sa comita abuzuri importante
8399011 plangerea penala impotriva lichidatorilor descrie modul artificial in care cu contributia nemijlocita a unor falsi creditori impotriva societatii noastre a fost deschisa procedura de administrare judiciara si lichidare cu concursul acestor asa zisi creditori pentru sc aviatia utilitara bucuresti sa s a creat o stare de aparenta insolventa cu scopul exclusiv de a i fi instrainat patrimoniul in beneficiul unor terti
8399012 pot sa faca plangere penala impotriva cui vor dumnealor la bankcoop am avut 13 000 de dosare astfel ca nu am cunostinta personal despre cel al aviatiei utilitare in momentul in care ne au adus la cunostinta despre faptul ca dumnealor si ar fi stins datoria fata de bankcoop am cerut sa se verifice iar cand s a constatat ca asa era ne am retras de la masa credala noi nu am avut nici un interes eu personal nu am avut nici un interes cu atat mai mult cu cat nu noi am solicitat reorganizarea judiciara ci doar ne am inscris la masa credala pentru ca ulterior sa ne retragem
8399013 chiar daca presupusul creditor bankcoop sa s a retras din dosarul de faliment al sc aviatia utilitara bucuresti sa inscrierea initiala a acestuia dar si a celorlalti falsi creditori la masa credala a generat desemnarea ca administrator judiciar a sc mira consulting srl motiv pentru care plangerea penala a fost indreptata si impotriva lichidatorilor bancii amintite aflate in faliment la sfarsitul anului 2004 administratorul judiciar mentionat a emis documente care au favorizat deposedarea sc aviatia utilitara bucuresti sa de o importanta parte a terenului pe care aceasta functioneaza pe care il castigasem insa irevocabil printr o decizie a inaltei curti de casatie si justitie
8399014 nu este un alt nume este numele pe care l am avut in israel si pe care nu l am folosit niciodata in romania in actele de identitate din romania intotdeauna a figurat numele de arin stanescu numele meu

8399021 the real giveaway i came to realize was that i hadnt been nervous before the match there are two kinds of nervous in tennis bad nervous which can make you freeze up play an inhibited game or choke and good nervous which is a sign that the match you are about to play really means a lot to you a sign that you cant wait to get out there and mix it up with your opponent even if youre not guaranteed the win

8399028 losers in every opportunity see a problem winners in every problem see an opportunity
8399029 at the end of that spain gold medal game where most people would said werent you relieved no i wasnt i was exhilarated it was euphoric it was the way it should be
8399030 and thats the way its going to be for me for the rest of my career too its going to be that way
8399031 over the years whether it be our own people here at duke obviously our opponents people in the media they expect you to be perfect
8399032 they dont look at process any more its like what we havent gone to the final four what we didnt win a national championship
8399033 you know very spoiled and it ruins it a little bit really a lot and so part of that becomes where you win and sometimes youre just relieved to win im not saying that that happens all the time but it happens
8399034 for the rest of my career im not going with that relief thing
8399035 we all get tired but theres good tired and bad tired
8399036 ive said a lot it was like being in a coaches clinic the last three summers
8399037 there are so many ideas there are so many times we sat with the whole staff exchanging ideas exchanging philosophies
8399038 and i think even so last year with our duke team there were things we tinkered with that were a little bit different here or there and well even add more things that coaches on our staff did but also the things you learn from the different countries you know its a different game and different ideas and different ways and different things and different plays
8399039 i learned a lot in the three years ive been doing this
8399040 i think im a better coach i know im a better coach after going through this theres no question about that
8399041 and i have a great understanding i think of the international game right now of how many good players there are how many good coaches there are
8399042 and for our whole staff to be there and be together and talk basketball you know in a normal situation its not like that in the normal summers
8399043 the elaborate procedure for clearance of development projects on forest land is painstakingly time consuming and complicated which leads to delay in implementation of projects this is hampering speedy development of this backward state
8399044 in my opinion this condition of converting civil and soyam land into reserve forests appears to be infructuous and impractical as far as uttarakhand is concerned
8399045 although the police team kept their visit secret we found out about their visit and began searching for om prakash
8399046 meanwhile we also got a message from the himachal police requesting us to keep an eye on the peddler
8399047 such detailed accuracy is typically found only in design of integrated circuits
8399048 the transparent window micro printing and optical variable device are hard to beat
8399049 we have stopped the flow of water there is no need to worry now for the residents of the area
8399050 it is not the rains but the water released by the irrigation department officials from the sharda canal that has led to the rise in the water level of the gomti
8399051 everywhere prices are rising but womens wages in the home based handicrafts industry like ours have remained the same for ages

8399066 some 80 000 supporters will see obama appear from between plywood columns painted off white
8399067 because seat belts can reduce the risk of injury and death in crashes by more than 50 there is a critical need for interventions to increase seat belt use by teens as both drivers and passengers
8399068 this research reinforces why state farm is actively involved in advocating for laws that help prevent injuries and deaths resulting from motor vehicle crashes its clear from these findings that primary seat belt laws for all occupants would help us accomplish that goal
8399069 yellowstone is located atop of one of the few large volcanic hotspots on earth
8399070 but though the hot material is a volcanic plume its cooler than others of its kind such as one in hawaii
8399071 although yellowstone sits above a plume of hot material coming up from deep with the earth its a remarkably lukewarm plume
8399072 it would be a mistake to write off yellowstone as a dead volcano a hot plume even a slightly cooler one is still hot

8399080 the best way to predict the future is to create it
8399081 i was really pleased with the way the team rode today everybody saw how well they worked for me and like always they pulled the break back and then set me up for the sprint
8399082 even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
8399083 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did and like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves
8399084 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
8399085 i would be more confident if maurie had done a training session with us but he still hasnt trained with the team since the semi finals
8399086 in a normal week i would have given him a rest but wild horses wont stop him making himself available for selection
8399087 ive not made the decision yet but hes a big person in this part of the world and he deserves an opportunity to play in a big game in his final season at the club
8399088 you dont want to miss any big game and it was extra special being the first one at the new wembley so it will be great to take part this year
8399089 our biggest concern is motu tony who had a recurrence of a knee injury
8399090 the grains of sand are falling and motus going to have a job getting onto the training pitch
8399091 the neck is fine and 100 but he has lost a lot of weight hes well underdone in terms of conditioning
8399092 we will take some guidance from the player himself on whether hes mentally ready but i think he has been in the game long enough to know he would only go out there if he was confident he could be an effective player
8399093 it raises people out of their wheelchair and lets them stand up straight
8399094 larrabee hasnt shipped so you dont know what it is and i dont know what it is

8399096 should we wait until we have brownouts and blackouts to build new power plants we need lights in our schools and power for our factories and electricity in our homes
8399097 it will be a question of whether we proceed with a new rule or whether we throw up our hands and say someone else should figure this out because it is beyond our control
8399098 are beyond our ability to address then there will be a permanent moratorium on power plant construction in southern california
8399099 judges ruling throws southern california power plant plans into disarray
8399100 se almeno tu mi vuoi bene siediti sul mio uccello

8399109 on monday the rubber dinghy started taking water and it overturned with the immigrants drowned
8399110 they just kept holding on to the dinghy until last night they were spotted by the maltese fishing vessel
8399111 my appeal goes to the government to release these immigrants from the detention centre because of their health and traumatic conditions
8399112 nothwithstanding that they know about previous tragedies these desperate people still try and make the journey to europe
8399113 i couldnt say because if someone has promised me to cheslea owner roman abramovich it wasnt me
8399114 im kidding of course ive always said that im happy at milan and as long as i have the same objectives as milan ill stay here
8399115 thats the way its always been my aim is to win and thats the same with milan as you can see by the effort theyve made in that direction strengthening the squad in such a way that this will always be a team of winners
8399116 people say were not interested in winning the uefa cup this group has won everything we could possibly win
8399117 our main aim is to win the scudetto i think inter milan will be the team to beat given what theyve done these last few years
8399118 then of course juve whove bought well this year theyll also be playing in the champions league and could have a great season
8399119 and then theres always as roma who are a team that play great football these will be our rivals throughout the season but there are always surprises
8399120 fiorentina are a team that have been playing together for some time now and last season they had a great year and they could repeat that
8399121 and then well see if there are any other surprise packages
8399122 i like him ive met him a few times we spoke a little and everyone thats worked with him says hes a great coach
8399123 most people do not have an easy way to manage the vast resources of the web to simplify their task at hand for the most part they are left trundling between web sites performing common tasks resulting in frustration and wasted time
8399124 for me the web is a little bit siloed for a lot of users
8399125 there are all of these actions you normally take but you have to go all over the web to do them even something as simple as seeing something online and wanting to send it to yourself or someone else as an sms short message service right now thats a pretty painful experience lots of clicking lots of trundling
8399126 we have the rudimentary systems of structured natural language commands you can select something and ubiq command the software to translate this to french or e mail it to jono in both cases ubiquity is smart enough to realize what this and it refers to as well as knowing who jono is by talking with my web mails contact list
8399127 its also smart enough to be able to understand commands like map chicago comics and yelp tapas near sf and give you rich previews and search results to get you where you want to be quickly even better both of those commands let you insert results directly into say an e mail youre writing so that you never have to interrupt your chain of thought
8399128 its not yet there but it is targeted for everyone to be able to use it right now ubiquity is a 0 1 alpha prototype experiment that isnt ready for everyone
8399129 in 0 2 and on the focus there is getting the community to innovate from the edges to start making interfaces that work well for the general population that might be by being put in the awesome bar the developer of the awesome bar started looking at this
8399130 over the years the united states has sent many of its fine young men and women into great peril to fight for freedom beyond our borders the only amount of land we have ever asked for in return is enough to bury those that did not return

8399213 he has really gotten to like romney theyve come a long way
8399214 one of the problems mccain would have if he picked romney was that it takes the joe biden issue off the table where biden is saying great things about mccain and terrible things about obama

8399227 the heart of a renegade is a skillfully crafted novel packed with complex characters involved in a well used plot line however it is innovatively done loreth anne whites pacing is superb maintaining ever mounting intensity as the story plays out this story is rich with detail and a plot that could be expanded to a 450 page hardcover that said it does not feel as if it were condensed but evolves in the expected manner only to twist and turn a bit adding interest and suspense the dynamics between jessica and luke are extraordinarily well handled white is a very gifted author and whose future novels will be sought out by this reviewer

8399299 five worst ways for devs to not finish a game
8399300 i also told him after you can follow orders we thought about letting him fake a squeeze but i told him no because victorino might break for the plate
8399301 i hit a fly ball off the end and it had a mark i checked it but what do i know it sounded fine i need to look at the tape and see exactly where i hit it it felt like i hit it pretty good
8399302 i like to think i was the inspiration behind the rally but i doubt thats the case
8399303 i dont think theres any question he kicked off the run scoring barrage
8399304 that kind of kicked us in the butt if the pitcher can double off pedro martinez then why isnt anybody else getting hits that jokingly is the way it felt
8399305 the other team gives you inspiration lets put it that way
8399306 we were able to take that and keep ourselves motivated youre looking over in that other dugout you feel a certain type of way you try to find something on any team but especially these guys
8399307 if we go on to win the division this will be the game to look back on
8399308 whether we won this game or lost it it wasnt going to make or break the year but the way in which we won it reinforces the fact that the phillies are never out of the game regardless of the score
8399309 i took her off the railing as gently as i could and felt her heart
8399310 he pumped on her chest and i blew down her throat
8399311 hit the sand on the road and lost control then hit the guard railing she bounced about four times
8399312 this needs to be addressed for the sake of our community
8399313 i had a couple of friends involved in putting that tower up and they knew it was the wind farm people seeing if it was a good spot everyone else thought it was a cellphone tower
8399314 the more i found out about them the more i believed them not to be good for this community my vision of this whole thing got broader and broader
8399315 my point of view was to get the information out there not to try and persuade anybody to change their mind another part of my policy was if im the lone voice in the wilderness if no one else agrees with me im not going to be the crazy person running around by myself but i never had to worry about that i had nothing but support
8399316 i called some friends who were actively interested in this three of us sat down and kicked around some ideas
8399317 i was a little disappointed at how complacent people were at first
8399318 this place has great meaning for those people who have been coming here for 40 50 years there was no way they were going to take this lying down
8399319 when i realized this was happening i thought its development you have to live with it
8399320 i sat down and wrote an open e mail i really agonized over it because i felt quite exposed i was going to put my opinion down and send it out to as many people as i could i very carefully said to my neighbours and fellow citizens im very concerned i feel i must reach out and find out if anyone thinks like me i felt as if i had no option that i had to do this
8399321 the mayor said that whoever would like to speak could stand and then he called on people at nine oclock the mayor ended the meeting while people were still standing and i was one of those people
8399322 the idea that there are people at the front of room who have the power and decision making control and theyre not listening i felt frustrated i had things to say that others had not contributed the idea that this would go through without any say by the public made my sense of justice rage
8399323 they dont just want to vote they want to do something else they want to feel like they can take part in the way our society is being shaped
8399324 its public land as far as im concerned the councillors do not own that land the citizens of this town own that public land just because we elected these people doesnt mean they can do what they want i believe that once you are elected you must continue to listen to your constituents and represent their desires not your own
8399325 we have to think about the limitations of our current system of democracy youre looking for ways outside the system to influence the system and one way to do that is to come together with others who have similar concerns in a specific area as an individual you can call your mla your mp and make those concerns heard but numbers were talking about having a critical mass of people coming to consensus ideally on an issue and making those voices heard or making changes themselves
8399326 this community is a pretty quiet community minded lovely tourist spot and i think we were all asleep we got complacent
8399327 ive got a desire for a new library here because im a library user
8399328 i noticed we needed a new library when i went into the childrens section and saw books piled in boxes because there is no shelf space
8399329 i think the fopl is a good example of what can be done with a bit of effort and will
8399330 they dont have the decision making power to make this happen alone but they do represent concerned citizens they are a good example of how a small group can make a difference

8399335 no one sets out to divide a community but thats the way it unfolded
8399336 im not against change and thats how its been interpreted but thats not what it is for me change just for changes sake without thinking about what youre sacrificing is foolish
8399337 i feel like i need to contribute to being part of how change happens
8399338 it is really scary especially at night walking to you car or in the morning when my managers get here early it is kinda scary you have to watch out

8399353 ive been around clay county all my life and this was the most negative campaign that ive ever seen

8399357 he will talk about how barack obama has what it takes to be a strong commander in chief
8399358 obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat
8399359 while barack obama recognizes that iran has been the biggest beneficiary of the war in iraq and that the bush mccain fear of tough diplomacy has allowed iran to spin 3800 centrifuges threaten israel and fund terrorism john mccain promises more of the same
8399360 if john mccain was serious about dealing with the threat from iran he would join barack obamas bipartisan effort in the senate to step up sanctions on iran instead of adopting the same tired old bush rove playbook

8399377 strategia noastra este sa crestem cifra de afaceri prin consolidarea echipei si luam in calcul achizitia unei companii din domeniile in care activam respectiv proiectare project management sau manufacturare insa majoritatea companiilor de profil sunt detinute de oameni de afaceri locali care nu vor sa vanda inca
8399378 in prezent lucram la cluj cu firma metahol care se ocupa de montarea cladirilor remco in zona transilvaniei iar in zona moldovei si munteniei avem alte companii ce ne asigura montajul costurile de constructie sunt din ce in ce mai mari si incercam sa regionalizam montajul si nu suntem interesati de o achizitie in acest domeniu
8399379 avem circa 8 10 contracte pe an cu o medie de 5 000 7 000 de metri patrati de hala pentru un proiect este o medie in concordanta cu dezvoltarea industriala a pietei locale anumite proiecte fiind de peste 10 000 sau 15 000 de metri patrati situatie ce se va schima in urmatorii ani spre exemplu in polonia care se afla cu circa 2 3 ani inaintea noastra ca dezvoltare a sectorului logistic media proiectelor pe hala a ajuns la circa 2 000 3 000 de metri patrati
8399380 marjele din logistica sunt foarte mici de aceea controlul eficient al costurilor este foarte important
8399381 viteza de dezvoltare a pietei de spatii logistice si industriale din estul europei este tot mai mare datorita companiilor din veste care si relocheaza activitatile sectorul industrial nu este afectat de criza financiara internationala pentru ca serviciile de logistica si distributie vor fi in continuare dezvoltate in estul europei de catre marii jucatori din vest si de cei autohtoni
8399382 suntem in negocieri cu doua trei companii producatoare de componente pentru producatorul auto ford in apropierea orasului craiova precum si cu un producator din industria mobilei care intentioneaza sa construiasca un proiect complex cu cateva hale de productie care insumeaza 18 000 de metri patrati in judetul mures
8399383 astfel de orase au devenit tinta investitorilor de profil dupa aglomerarea capitalei
8399384 pana in 2004 2005 contractele erau derulate de compania din olanda prin serviciul de export proiectul era trimis in olanda de unde se organiza productia componentelor si se asigura transportul camioanelor cu structuri ulterior subsidiara locala s a dezvoltat foarte mult si a inceput sa administreze singura contractele
8399385 contractul cu montupet a fost semnat in 2006 cand eram venit de o luna in firma
8399386 ulterior viceprimarul din ruse i a contactat pe cei de la montupet si a acordat gratis terenul pentru viitoarea investitie in parcul industrial ruse precum si infrastructura necesara proiectului
8399387 numeroasele proiecte de investitii anuntate pe piata imobiliara ne indreptatesc sa credem ca piata de distributie a materialelor de constructii va continua sa creasca in ceea ce priveste piata de do it yourself pana in anul 2015 este de asteptat sa se produca o saturare la nivelul acoperirii geografice insa cu siguranta va fi nevoie de o permanenta imbunatatire a conceptului si a ofertelor pe piata
8399388 planul investitional al companiei prevede extinderea retelei actuale cu 3 4 magazine pe an pe termen mediu urmarindu se acoperirea zonei de sud a tarii iar pe termen lung sa avem 30 de magazine
8399389 din suma totala au fost deja investite 20 milioane de euro in terenuri si 15 milioane de euro in constructia magazinelor
8399390 principalii factori care au influentat evolutia vanzarilor sunt extinderea retelei de magazine precum si majorarea preturilor materialelor de constructii acestea la randul lor fiind influentate de dinamica constructiilor si a investitiilor imobiliare
8399391 consumul de materiale de constructii a fost afectat din cauza conditiilor de creditare mai aspre si a pierderii apetitului de creditare al bancilor efectul insa nu a fost asa de puternic ca in alte tari ne asteptam ca in 2009 sa resimtim mai puternic consecintele stagnarii pietei imobiliare dupa ce vor fi finalizate o parte din proiectele incepute in anii trecuti
8399392 avand in vedere evolutia din primele sase luni consideram ca nivelul de crestere de 25 preconizat la inceputul anului este fezabil
8399393 in bulgaria si serbia suntem in faza de inceput in care ne facem cunoscuti in piata iar in moldova si ucraina suntem in proces de consolidare a afacerilor in primul semestru am inaugurat o noua filiala in ucraina la rovno oras cu peste 500 000 locuitori
8399394 in acest an 73 de colegi vor parasi compania iar pentru etapele urmatoare se prevede un numar de aproximativ 80 de salariati in 2009 si inca 35 in 2010
8399395 pe langa consiliere care este permanenta trebuie sa stai de vorba cu oamenii si sa vezi ce ganduri au poate unii au fost operatori toata viata si acum vor sa se faca piloti trebuie sa vezi ce visuri au si apoi sa le aplici teste sa i indrumi sa i faci sa se cunoasca pe sine
8399396 reducerile de personal s au facut treptat intre 1998 si 2007 dar foarte multe dintre ele au aparut ca urmare a externalizarii anumitor activitati
8399397 angajatii nostri au o dispunere relativ echilibrata in randul unitatilor de productie in fiecare fabrica fiind circa 300 de persoane vom recruta inca 40 50 de persoane pentru fabrica de la bicaz si ne vom orienta spre atragerea fostilor angajati care au lucrat anterior in cadrul companiei
8399398 ne dorim ca angajatii pentru bicaz sa fie disponibili pana in martie anul viitor pentru a avea suficient timp sa i pregatim procesul de recrutare pentru bicaz nu a inceput insa va demara dupa perioada concediilor undeva in luna septembrie
8399399 nu s a luat nicio decizie concreta in ceea ce priveste constructia unei fabrici dar o hotarare de acest gen va fi adoptata astfel incat sa ne acorde suficient timp pentru a angaja oamenii necesari
8399400 contributiile la pensiile facultative sunt deductibile in limita a 200 de euro pe an atat pentru angajat cat si pentru angajator respectiv 400 de euro in total pe an in cazul in care s ar inscrie toti angajatii ne ar costa 300 000 de euro pe an
8399401 vrem sa achizitionam o companie de constructii locala de marime medie care sa detina sucursale in orasele din provincie resurse umane utilaje si unitati de productie am stabilit deja primele contacte cu anumite companii si ne aflam in negocieri
8399402 de la sapte angajati cati eram in 2006 am ajuns astazi la circa 250 odata cu extinderea contractelor urmand sa ajungem la circa 280 pana la finalul anului strategia noastra este sa avem propriii angajati si nu avem un buget stabilit pentru o eventuala achizitie
8399403 vrem sa cream o echipa stabila pe piata locala si sa ne concentram pe proiectele de infrastructura cum sunt autostrazile si drumurile nationale participam la procesul de licitatie pentru proiectul in parteneriat public privat comarnic brasov avand in vedere ca am derulat doua astfel de contracte si in ungaria impreuna cu grupul bilfinger berger
8399404 investitiile pe piata locala au ajuns in prezent la 10 15 milioane de euro in dezvoltarea activitatii de pe piata locala in achizitia de echipamente dezvoltarea de facilitati de productie si achizitionarea de materii prime
8399405 am inaugurat recent un birou in zona de vest a tarii la timisoara care se va implica in executarea de proiecte locale
8399406 in urmatorii 10 15 ani piata locala a constructiilor va continua trendul ascendent in prezent piata se dezvolta haotic iar ritmul de crestere a pretului la materiale de constructii si al fortei de lucru a fost foarte dinamic insa in scurt timp se va atinge un nivel maxim al preturilor peste care investitiile de pe piata constructiilor nu vor mai fi profitabile
8399407 din pacate birocratia este foarte ridicata si impiedica implementarea rapida a proiectelor
8399408 productivitatea muncii este de cinci ori mai redusa decat in austria si avem nevoie de trei pana la de cinci ori mai multi angajati decat utilizam de obicei la o lucrare aducem specialisti din grup care organizeaza traininguri de pregatire a angajatilor
8399409 in momentul in care muncitorul roman nu va mai avea grija zilei de maine va deveni mai eficient si vom putea reduce echipele actuale cu circa 50 de multe ori tineam muncitorii pe santier cinci zile pe saptamana iar ei alegeau sa lucreze si sambata si duminica pe alte santiere pentru a si majora castigurile insa productivitatea din timpul saptamanii scadea
8399410 romanii care au plecat in strainatate in ultimii 15 20 de ani vor fi adusi cu greu inapoi pentru ca si au creat un anumit stil de viata pe care aici nu l regasesc nu vrem sa aducem muncitori straini pentru a nu uni prea multe culturi pe santier
8399411 primul proiect va fi dezvoltat in nordul bucurestiului si va cuprinde birouri si apartamente pentru angajati investitia urmand sa se ridice la circa 5 milioane de euro intr o prima faza
8399412 strategia noastra pentru urmatorii cinci ani este sa devenim dezvoltator si sa reducem activitatea de constructii proiectele pe care le incepem acum vor fi finalizate in urmatorii trei cinci ani si consideram ca blocajul din lunile martie aprilie de pe piata imobiliara isi va reveni si vom asista din nou la vanzari similare cu cele din 2007
8399413 colloseum tower se afla deocamdata in stadiul de proiectare am obtinut puz ul proiectul va fi definitivat in urmatorii doi ani iar constructia va fi finalizata in trei ani avand in vedere complexitatea proiectului
8399414 pentru belvedere baneasa am contractat o finantare de 35 de milioane de euro de la bcr si am contractat deja 20 din apartamente vom atrage credite si pentru alte proiecte precum colloseum tower
8399415 apartamentele din cadrul proiectului antiaeriana se vand foarte repede ritmul fiind de 40 de locuinte pe zi
8399416 consider ca nu e departe timpul ca asa cum au cazut afaceri subrede cu finantari debalansate investitori de carton sa vina dificultatile respectiv falimentul pentru unii dezvoltatori neprofesionisti si totodata problemele pentru finantatorii acestora este o evolutie fireasca pe o piata imobiliara care se maturizeaza rapid avand in vedere si contextul international
8399417 cum intr o economie de piata esecul unora poate fi succesul altora sunt convins ca o parte dintre proiectele viabile bine localizate vor ajunge prin intermediul bancilor sau al lichidatorilor in mana unor dezvoltatori profesionisti care beneficiind de fonduri proprii si de finantare adecvata le vor finaliza cu succes si la niste preturi rezonabile dupa incalzirea de multe ori nejustificata a preturilor in raport cu puterea de cumparare in special pentru patura de tineri care au intrat recent in sfera muncii piata isi va reveni vor aparea si dezvoltatori de calitate cu preturi decente care sa satisfaca acest segment de clienti
8399418 a inceput sa se incheie etapa cand profiturile dezvoltatorilor erau de 80 100 se trece usor la marje de 15 25 scadere care se va accentua odata cu adoptarea masurilor bnr care evident vor reduce din viteza de expansiune a creditului
8399419 dezvoltatorii nu intra in greva eventual piata ii va exclude pe cei neprofesionisti si pe cei la care primeaza exclusiv caracterul speculativ ei nu sunt adevaratii investitori pe o piata matura cum este in devenire piata imobiliara romaneasca in romania este inca nevoie de constructii de calitate si dezvoltatorii se vor multumi cu rate ale profitului decente care sa acopere nivelul de risc relativ scazut pe o piata in care de abia in ultimii 2 3 ani a inceput sa apara o oferta consistenta dezvoltatorii care doresc marje mai mari de profit respectiv isi asuma riscuri mai mari vor cauta alte piete emergente referindu ma in acest caz in special la investitorii straini
8399420 piata de mobila a mers asa cum ne asteptam la nivelul mobexpert pot spune ca am fost peste aceasta evolutie iar pentru intregul an cred ca vom termina cu o crestere de 20 in 2007 a doua jumatate a anului a fost foarte buna
8399421 daca acest ppp va merge romania va atrage atentia marilor constructori de drumuri din lume care inca nu s au uitat cu atentie la noi ar fi un vot de maturitate dat relatiei dintre stat si mediul privat un nou esec insa pe langa amanarea construirii acestui tronson ar putea insemna sfarsitul sau amanarea pe termen lung a ppp ului in romania
8399422 cea mai grea parte este impartirea riscurilor cele doua parti trebuie sa se hotarasca fiecare ce face statul vine cu terenul se ocupa de exproprieri constructorul se ocupa de executie de exemplu
8399423 daca statul construieste cu banii lui si nu scoate la licitatie intretinerea se intampla ceea ce avem acum adica proiecte finalizate cu garantie de 2 5 ani dupa aceasta perioada insa daca statul nu are bani starea soselei va fi din ce in ce mai proasta
8399424 am intrebat un oficial american la un moment dat care trebuie sa fie procentual diferenta dintre cele doua estimari pentru a se alege un ppp cu cat trebuie sa fie mai ieftin un ppp decat proiectul executat de catre stat un dolar mi a raspuns el si asa si este pentru ca in mod normal cele doua calcule reprezinta cele doua variante extreme ale bugetului conservator daca este vorba despre stat deci optimist si maximal daca este al partenerului privat deci pesimist
8399425 cu siguranta incepand cu livrarea primelor doua proiecte care sunt deja preinchiriate integral cu un total de 60 000 de metri patrati zona poate sa concureze cu piata victoriei si va deveni o zona foarte cautata de companiile multinationale
8399426 de obicei companiile multinationale sunt cele care aleg aceasta locatie motivele pentru aceasta alegere sunt vizibilitatea si o ratie de parcare intre un loc 50 de metri patrati si un loc 70 de metri patrati de asemenea companiile care se relocheaza in aceasta zona au bugete pentru o chirie intre 16 5 euro metrul patrat luna si 20 de euro metrul patrat luna
8399427 in cativa ani barbu vacarescu va deveni un centru financiar al bucurestiului cu mai mult de 600 000 de metri patrati de birouri lucrarile la proiectul nostru n r vor incepe la sfarsitul anului 2008 si se vor termina in vara anului 2011
8399428 in general in bucuresti exista probleme cu infrastructura totusi barbu vacarescu floreasca comparativ cu alte zone ale orasului are o infrastructura buna accesul catre oras se face pe doua artere cu doua benzi fiecare calea floreasca si barbu vacarescu iar legatura cu zona de est se realizeaza pe soseaua petricani iar catre centru prin bulevardul aviatorilor
8399429 banca romaneasca membra a national bank of greece a inchiriat sase etaje insumand mai mult de o treime din suprafata inchiriabila din euro tower banca romaneasca este si institutia care asigura finantarea proiectului valoarea estimata a investitiei in euro tower este de 60 milioane de euro
8399430 semnalele ca o serie de proiecte din afara bucurestiului nu au succesul scontat au determinat o serie de retaileri sa si reconsidere politica de expansiune pot spune ca nu dormeam foarte bine pana am ajuns ca la arad sa avem contracte semnate pentru mai mult de 50 din suprafata mallului cu ancore puternice precum cinema city sau billa
8399431 este adevarat ca in ultimii doi ani acestea au fost cele mai bune oportunitati dar pe viitor nu vom ramane legati de acest fenomen intrucat nu suntem focusati numai pe acest gen de locatii
8399432 este cel mai modern comert si trebuia sa intram in toate proiectele mari dorim sa fim prezenti in toate pentru ca aceste locatii ne permit dezvoltarea pe suprafete mari ceea ce locatiile stradale nu ne poate oferi

8399443 economia romaneasca va inregistra o evolutie de minimum 6 in 2008 continuand tendinta de crestere a pietei din ultimii ani aceasta dinamica are un impact direct asupra standardului de viata al romanilor reflectandu se si intr o crestere a cererii de locuinte noi in acest context estimam ca incetinirea recenta a pietei rezidentiale este in mare masura de natura psihologica si se va incheia curand cererea revenind la nivelul normal concomitent preturile locuintelor noi vor urca datorita cresterii costurilor de constructie
8399444 prima etapa de vanzari din cadrul proiectului s a incheiat dupa ce au fost vandute 29 din cele 64 de apartamente urmand ca in scurt timp sa inceapa vanzarea etajelor superioare
8399445 estimarile arata ca in aceasta perioada din an majoritatea celor care cumpara apartamente noi in proiectele rezidentiale sunt cei care muncesc in strainatate si s au intors acum in romania

8399489 the employment tribunal rules state that you have six months from the date you end your employment to lodge a claim in the employment tribunal
8399490 the problem for most our clients in the wigan area is that they simply did not know they had an equal pay claim and by the time they found out six months had elapsed and they were consequently precluded from bringing an equal pay claim to the employment tribunal
8399491 to help these women our firm is proposing to bring an action for breach of contract in the high court which is an innovative way of dealing with the problem of these clients being time barred or not being able to bring a claim to the tribunal
8399492 in terms of building the case we are presently seeking more information and asking ex council employees to contact us
8399493 to date we have made a freedom of information request to wigan asking about bonuses which are potentially discriminatory and about any equal pay pay outs made by the council it transpires that offers have been made
8399494 we have made offers of compensation to approximately 2 300 employees and initially 1 800 accepted since then the council has continued to work with employees and this has now risen to approximately 2 200
8399495 some cases have been lodged at the employment tribunal but it is potentially several years before these cases are resolved the council is mindful of its obligations and is working closely with its trade union partners
8399496 we are very disappointed with the motion that was agreed
8399497 we were presented with similar proposals earlier and we rejected them we were going through the collective agreement procedures and it was anticipated members were going to agree but now the rug has been pulled from under our feet
8399498 between 2000 and 2500 people will not receive any backdated pay one member was due to receive 27 000 there is now talk of moving towards a ballot for industrial action and reporting the council provost to the standards commission
8399499 despite the council being required to review its position of the backdating of salaries to april 2006 an investment of approximately 7m in compensation packages will be provided for female members of staff who have been identified as being in a position of pay inequality

8399521 romanii cu venituri ridicate apeleaza tot mai des la un arhitect designer pentru amenajarea locuintei in anii 90 aproape nimeni nu importa materiale din categoria high end pentru decorarea de locuinte clientii nostri nu intelegeau care sunt calitatile acestor materiale si eram obligati sa facem analogii cu brandurile de masini de lux care reprezentau un reper pentru ei
8399522 in prezent clientii nostri au foarte multe resurse de informare si in plus calatoresc destul de des si pot observa ultimele tendinte in materie de amenajari din tarile dezvoltate

8399527 cererile pentru amenajarea locuintelor de lux au crescut incepand cu 2003 pana atunci clientii erau mult mai exclusivisti decat in prezent
8399528 cea mai mare problema cu care ne confruntam este ca nu gasim mesteri specializati in anumite lucrari de montaj au fost cazuri cand am fost nevoiti sa ne ocupam chiar noi de montaj pentru a demonstra ca se poate facem orice cand tinem la o lucrare pentru a iesi asa cum a fost gandita
8399529 zona pipera nu mai este la fel de interesanta pentru cei interesati sa si construiasca case de lux pentru ca nu pot asigura calitatea unei lucrari in conditiile in care s a construit haotic infrastructura este deficitara nu exista un sistem de canalizare corespunzator numarului de constructii nu sunt suficiente dotarile si echipamentele si se ajunge foarte greu
8399530 vrem sa ramanem pe aceasta nisa a locuintelor de lux pentru ca nu ne dorim sa ajungem un institut de proiectare in prezent avem aproximativ 20 de proiecte pe an si e un numar ridicat avand in vedere timpul pe care il necesita o astfel de lucrare preferam sa avem lucrari complete iar daca sunt de amenajare sa fie inca din faza de proiectare sau in stadiu nu foarte avansat

8399549 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory lets declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8399550 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8399551 there are some folks who will still hold out but anyone who thinks hillary clinton and john mccain have anything in common is crazy
8399552 my parents taught us to live our faith and treasure our family we learned the dignity of work and we were told that anyone can make it if they try
8399553 im going to do what hillary told me to do
8399554 i am not telling you what to do because you have come here from so many different places having made this journey
8399555 the hurt some of us may feel will be so much worse if john mccain is president of the united states
8399556 ill support obama but my hearts not in it my heart is with hillary its difficult but ill abide by her orders
8399557 we need to hear something more specific before i can say ill vote for him
8399558 no doubt in my mind that shell be the president of the united states one day
8399559 i think john mccain is wrong he doesnt even know how many homes he has weve seen the mccain position as just a continuation of the bush administration its president bushs policies that got us into the mess that we have now and its not only a short term crisis its long term and it has to be addressed workers are having a tough time the wage inequality thats out there is unbelievable and health care and retirement security are threatened those are some of the reasons that were not supporting john mccain
8399560 im one of the few guys on the planet that has the best job they want in the whole world im certainly blessed
8399561 this is a good game for the state of colorado
8399562 its as big for cu as it is for us it needs to be played in denver every year i think the whole state knows that and hopefully that will be the case
8399563 i know most of the guys on the coaching staff
8399564 ive said all along hes a great person and even better coach
8399565 it is a little strange that hes not roaming the halls ive spoken with him i have all the respect in the world for him as a friend if i have a problem i can call him about it hes that type of person
8399566 he knows and respects sonny bringing in a guy like steve because hes been on the staff its more like hes picking up the reins hes going to keep with the traditions hes going to continue everything that lubick ever built because he was a part of that
8399567 im very excited about the assistants i was able to hire and last january we put together an extremely intense offseason conditioning program that led us all the way up to august almost militaristic type training
8399568 steve is so well grounded hes in this for all the right reasons i just really believe hes the right guy at the right time
8399569 he loves that place like we all do he has the attitude and presence that we need
8399570 you know what you have to do and if you dont do it you will hear about it
8399571 hes done a tremendous job of coming in and establishing his own personality and how he wants to run things
8399572 hes a lot more assertive than when he was an assistant and of course hes in a position to be more assertive hes very confident in what he wants and how he wants to do it
8399573 you cant do quite the volume you do in the nfl just because you dont have as much practice time
8399574 were out there for a certain period of time and during that time id like to get as many plays as we could
8399575 he set a high standard for them on and off the field and he backs it up sonnys style was very effective i loved working for sonny steves style of leadership is different and it is also good
8399576 coach fairchild is very direct succinct and to the point
8399577 coach lubick obviously his style worked for him the way he went about things was free for a little more room to improvise coach fairchild comes in with the game plan and knows exactly what he wants to do and the way he wants to execute it
8399578 its been a change of pace from the way we used to do things it was kind of a change in mind set and sometimes thats good it was a new energy more than anything and it brought a little more of a spark and a little more life that had maybe died out a little bit
8399579 guys come out and are flying around and they are trying to make plays
8399580 coach fairchild is a little more businesslike they brought coach fairchild in to win games hes a personable guy but on the field its all business i think thats more of an nfl approach youre here to work
8399581 i dont tell a lot of jokes but i will tell you the truth i believe in hard work and accountability

8399746 ghana being a tropical country the effect of climate change can be twofold
8399747 it can result in prolonged droughts and erratic rainfall patterns in which case there can be years of too much rain too much rain than expected or less than expected in certain parts of the country as happened in the northern part of the country last year we had so much rain and flooding that had not been experienced in decades
8399748 the problem with deforestation is largely to blame on the government
8399749 that is the government is not committed to some of the basic rules that it itself has put in place to regulate or to ensure that forest is conserved one is the issue that the government is not able to control what we call the annual allocation of companies in timber processing so because government can not monitor people are always cutting beyond what we call the annual allowable cut

8399759 a perceptually validated model for surface depth hallucination capturing depth to represent detailed surface geometry normally requires expensive specialized equipment and or collection of a large amount of data by trading accuracy for ease of capture the authors of this paper aim to recover surfaces that can be plausibly relit and viewed from any angle under any lighting this multiscale shape from shading method takes diffuse lit and flash lit image pairs and produces an albedo map and textured height field using two lighting conditions enables subtraction of one from the other to estimate albedo experimental validation shows that the method works for a broad range of textured surfaces and users are frequently unable to identify the results as synthetic in a randomized presentation
8399760 software then compares the brightness of every matching pair of pixels in the two images and calculates how much of a pixels brightness is down to its position and how much is due to its colour that information is used to produce a realistic rendering of a surfaces texture by altering the direction of illumination on the virtual surface the system can generate realistic shadow effects

8399800 because of speculation among scientists that viral infections provoke the inflammation that increases the risk of macular degeneration we tested for associations between amd and tlr3 which is known to support innate immunity and host defense
8399801 if you are genetically susceptible to macular degeneration and are exposed to a virus that activates tlr3 it could lead to the death of cells in the macula
8399802 ironically in some individuals using rnai to cure wet amd might actually increase the risk for blindness from dry amd
8399803 these findings pave the way for using tlr3 inhibitors as a potential new therapy for dry amd and simultaneously highlight the importance of critically assessing the potential risk posed to patients by rnai based therapies
8399804 what tlr3 does in the case of perceived infection is to sacrifice infected cells in this case retinal pigment epithilial cells to protect the neighborhood
8399805 biologically well intentioned though the sacrifice may be it can lead to blindness
8399806 given its high prevalence in the united states and the world finding effective prevention and treatment strategies for amd is of critical importance this finding represents a major advancement in our understanding of dry amd for which effective treatment is not yet available
8399807 the problem is that if you happen to be an individual who has the wrong genetic code in tlr3 you might inadvertently trigger a detrimental effect in your retina
8399808 you might cure the individual of one thing and increase their risk in something else
8399809 this discovery has significant implications for diagnosing the dry form of amd which is the most prevalent form affecting more than 8 million americans
8399810 it also allows us to develop new drugs to treat the dry form of amd for which there currently is no treatment
8399811 what tlr3 does in the case of infection is sacrifice an infected cell to protect the neighborhood
8399812 you and me we have a good 20 to 30 percent chance of getting macular degeneration
8399813 so when the time comes for us to start thinking about intervention we might want to get genotyped first and then decide what kind of therapeutic paradigm might be most appropriate for us
8399814 if we can figure out which viruses might be acting as triggers we might be able to find a way to combat them this would be a far more effective therapy in my view than trying to design a gene therapy approach
8399815 clearly the statement that were not all the same is not exactly novel and yet im still struck by how homogenized people become when it comes to clinical trials
8399816 breast cancer and prostate cancer develop due to many reasons but environmental factors and lifestyle play a major role in these cancers
8399817 when men and women from india and pakistan migrate to the united states their disease profiles change mirroring the american risk
8399818 we need to educate the immigrant population about risk factors as well as preventive measures they can take to reduce their risk of prostate breast cancer lung cancer and colon cancer
8399819 this is one of the most promising breakthroughs in the management of high risk pregnancies in more than 30 years
8399820 the active ingredient we used in this study magnesium sulfate is better known as epsom salt
8399821 and virtually every delivery room in the united states is already stocked with magnesium sulfate solutions that are given to pregnant women during childbirth for other reasons
8399822 so what we have learned from this study is that we have a cheap widely available treatment already in hand that cuts in half the risk of babies being born with an extremely disabling disorder that is a tremendously exciting development
8399823 were happy with the verdict but its a shame this should have been limited to one death
8399824 he should have had the courage and the guts to kill himself before killing anyone else

8399886 i also attended comic con in san diego a lot of users expressed their frustration that the arcade version is only released in asia and they still cant put their hands on street fighter iv im thinking as long as the game has the basic tool function for everyone to enjoy we may be able to release it on the early side we still dont know

8399935 these measures will send a clear message to the world
8399936 canada takes full responsibility for environmental protection and enforcement in our arctic waters
8399937 some countries may object to what were doing on principle on the grounds that they may not recognize our sovereignty
8399938 i think everybody understands that canada has no particular power play here this is in the interests of order and also in the interests of environmental protection
8399939 were increasing our coast guard fleet we will be increasing our capacity to intercept and detain those who dont respect the reporting requirements
8399940 for the most part the countries that are going into the arctic right now are co operating
8399941 its the new companies coming into the arctic that could be a concern mandatory registration will force new ones to comply
8399942 russian vessels will be visiting syria and other friendly ports more frequently
8399943 were at a crossroads and jordan must protect itself and its national interests
8399944 find out what the jordanians are up to and if their contacts with hamas meant dropping support for the palestinian authority
8399945 were against any negotiations with hamas because we regard it as a terrorist movement
8399946 we should find ways to strengthen the palestinian authority instead of legitimizing hamas which made an illegal military coup in gaza
8399947 their first demand was france then they negotiated for libyan asylum then they had no other solution there was no escape
8399948 i heard all the goings on it was rational and calm
8399949 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8399950 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time

8399953 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8399954 este mai ieftin sa aducem un expat indian decat sa angajam un executiv roman
8399955 preturile la otel beton si ciment nu sunt controlate de nimeni
8399956 acolo unde exista o relatie corecta intre beneficiar si constructor normal este sa se reactualizeze preturile un constructor intotdeauna estimeaza o crestere de circa 10 15 a preturilor cand semneaza un contract insa nimeni nu a putut previziona evolutia actuala a costurilor
8399957 este mai ieftin sa aducem un expat indian decat sa angajam un executiv roman
8399958 sedinta de ieri a fost destul de slaba daca nu cea mai slaba din ultima perioada avand in vedere lichiditatea atinsa ieri este posibil sa ne aflam aproape de sfarsitul acestor scaderi si sa vedem o usoara crestere insa nu trebuie sa ne asteptam la o intoarcere brusca si o inversare de trend
8399959 he tratado de hacer lo que me ha pedido el entrenador se nos han dado las cosas hemos trabajado duro en los entrenamientos para que en los partidos podamos sacar los resultados estoy contento porque pienso que he hecho un buen papel en algunos juegos he quedado a deber un poco debo trabajar y seguir por el mismo camino
8399960 me cost un poco de trabajo a lo mejor no me acoplaba al sistema del entrenador pero estoy tratando de llenarle el ojo y que me siga dando continuidad no debo pensar que ya tengo asegurado el puesto trabajar d a a d a para cuando me den oportunidad mostrarles que estoy haciendo bien las cosas
8399961 es dif cil pero no imposible y creo que todos los j venes que estamos aqu le estamos llenando el ojo creo que vamos por buen camino

8399966 fondul inchis de investitii va urmari obtinerea unor randamente superioare dobanzilor interbancare in conditiile asumarii unui grad redus de risc prin capitalizarea evolutiilor de pe pietele monetara si valutara
8399967 in contextul corectiilor agresive ale bursei din acest an am considerat ca reducerea comisioanelor de administrare pana la sfarsitul anului va veni in sprijinul investitorilor ale caror plasamente au pierdut din valoare nu ne asteptam la o revenire a pietei pana la sfarsitul anului
8399968 nu cred ca exista investitori multumiti in acest moment pe piata de capital administratorilor de fonduri le este foarte greu sa gaseasca solutii prin care sa poata proteja investitorii de corectii reducerea comisioanelor de administrare poate fi o solutie prin care administratorii mai pot reduce din impactul negativ al corectiilor
8399969 anul trecut am redus comisionul lunar de administrare de la 0 3 la 0 1 in cazul fondului de obligatiuni fortuna gold pentru a veni in sprijinul investitorilor care trec de la fondul diversificat fortuna classic la fondul de obligatiuni
8399970 chiar daca piata actiunilor este afectata de corectii investitorii inca se uita la randamente cand aleg sa investeasca in fonduri pretul unitatilor de fond a ajuns in acest moment foarte jos insa investitorii nu se ingramadesc sa cumpere investitorii prefera sa cumpere atunci cand preturile cresc nu cand scad este un comportament anormal care denota lipsa unei culturi investitionale
8399971 it gives the government a fresh mandate that will give the government another couple of years to proceed
8399972 i dont think harper has to be thinking about a majority at all
8399973 strategically this is sort of a prolonged war of attrition
8399974 you can fight a war with some objective less than total victory
8399975 would be enough to throw the liberals into turmoil and give harper a virtually free hand in parliament for quite a while and really handicap his main opponent
8399976 he doesnt like being at the mercy of others he likes to be in control of what hes doing
8399977 i suspect that theres some pretty strong or in depth party polls that are riding by riding that are persuading him that his chances are pretty good right now

8399980 vom continua negocierile cu diverse companii aeriene in vederea diversificarii ofertei pentru pasagerii nostri dar si negocierile cu companiile aeriene deja existente in vederea deschiderii de noi rute cresterii numarului de frecvente si a capacitatii

8399992 the country really needs a fresh approach to our national security challenges
8399993 the clinton message and the obama message were not terribly different

8399995 while on active duty i was very disappointed in a number of decisions rendered by the bush administration and their failure to support initiatives i considered very important including my own to develop the iraqi armed forces
8399996 duty bound to fill what i consider to be a role to stand up for a man who really does have the potential to get things turned around for the united states
