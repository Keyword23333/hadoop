3960016 i assume a lot of restaurants will have a line or a waiting list and theres a lot of unfamiliarity with whats going on with traffic and protesters there are just too many unknowns
3960017 we feel that theres a significant number of people who want to get out of town when this craziness is going on

3960408 bryant has certainly gotten more than it bargained for when it brought michael onboard they made the division ii playoffs for the first time theyve gotten some publicity and now he turns it up again everyone is going to have their eyes on bryant to see what kind of impact zack can have
3960409 you often hear about some guy whos supposed to be good and he winds up flunking out or not living up to the buildup but john was pretty amazing from day one he was a step ahead of everyone else tricking everybody with his back shots and stuff
3960410 hes helped everybody so much i know i wouldnt have as many points as i do 39 if it werent for him
3960411 i think he will give bryants players a shot of confidence
3960412 he will lift that entire team and maybe he will get a chance to show some things in the past he wasnt the guy who carried the ball because he didnt need to he didnt take it out off the endline maybe he will do those things
3960413 were pretty much each others biggest fans and biggest critics
3960414 when i looked at it i only had time off in september october and december

3960425 there may be some differences of opinion on some issues on major issues such as
3960426 but when it comes to anti semitism i think were on the same page
3960427 we mentioned our concerns about anti semitism and asked him what his position was
3960428 and he said he was certainly not an anti semite
3960429 all forms of anti semitism discrimination against minorities and anti muslim sentiment
3960430 i have family that are prosecutors and i could never see them going after anyone just to score political points i was naive i was wrong and i hope that act finally rights the wrong
3960431 bad idea if greer stayed duke had a solid chance of contending for a national championship plus greer could have been poy
3960432 bad idea if greer stayed duke had a solid chance of contending for a national championship plus greer could have been poy

3960434 greer is retarted how does this benifit him besides easy goals compare a dimploma from duke univeristy to bryant aka matt donawski works on wall strett greer is a true canadian moron

3960439 many of the poets included in atlas poetica are well established american tanka poets writing in well established traditions exploring many experiences but for the most part centred on a particular locality there are also many poems from poets around the world although this collection of tanka is autobiographical in inspiration based as it is on the poetry of place it brings new levels of artistry innovation and appreciation of the tanka form

3960441 as soon as this carpenters return to suva the soldiers rfmf engineers will come in to repair the school that is when the two water tanks will come
3960442 i am really happy with what mr dau told me in the past years we have to close the school one week or two weeks before the school holiday it is the students thats going to suffer
3960443 when the dry season comes we have to keep our fingers crossed for rain to fill up the water tanks with what mr dau told me i was happy

3960446 is that one of the pardy kids wow theyve grown a lot and so gorgeous
3960447 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3960448 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3960449 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3960450 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3960451 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3960452 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3960453 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3960454 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3960455 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3960456 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3960457 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3960458 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3960459 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3960460 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3960461 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3960462 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3960463 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3960464 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3960475 f there are indeed haitian athletes in beijing who decide to defect i could not blame them
3960476 dude its ridiculous how many times a day i have to see your ugly face
3960477 is he the boy in the relay he did a great job
3960478 we watch almost every game we know almost every detail how tall a player is who can shoot who can pass i know phelpss race but i am more familiar with the n b a i cant swim but i can play basketball
3960479 it incited a lot of attacks on him from ultranationalists who thought that by simply describing phelpss quest he was saying the u s was better than china
3960480 is that with china doing so well winning so many gold medals leading the count it may be an editorial policy that if you give too much attention to michael phelps there could be a danger of inciting ultranationalism why are you writing about him when china is doing so well they are sensitive to ultranationalism they know the world is watching they dont want any ugliness
3960481 its pretty cool to have a country behind you and on your side
3960482 no matter where any americans are in the world theyre watching and cheering its a pretty special feeling
3960483 hes not only defeating his competition hes challenging himself all the time
3960484 if he was chinese his accomplishments would make him even more popular than yao ming and liu xiang combined
3960485 he is definitely one of the 25 greatest athletes of this century no actually hes one of the top five in all history
3960486 we were all on welfare and we were all poor dirt poor
3960487 the government told us the only way we were going to get food stamps was if a camel passed through the eye of a needle they lied we got the food stamps to feed the babies
3960488 it was just so hard but somebody had to do it
3960489 we all started to talk about it and you know how women do
3960490 i am very happy i feel honoured that i have won the first gold medal in the olympics
3960491 the cabinet is likely to take up the sixth pay panel report for approval tomorrow and the matter was discussed at a meeting chaired by the pm today
3960492 theres no question that michael is an extraordinarily important driver people may come to see michael phelps but they stay to see lots of other olympic content
3960493 phelps not only attained history he transcended it and he isnt finished yet
3960494 phelps simply exists on a different level than everyone else now a different plane something tells you that he could swim as fast as he needed to if he were wearing an old flannel baseball uniform in the hackensack river
3960495 its hard to figure whats the most impressive part of all this
3960496 its all so mind boggling hes obviously the fastest swimmer the best conditioned swimmer he makes the best turns he uses the most powerful strokes hes the most competitive son of a gun on the blocks

3960500 i had had contact with french producers wild bunch whod put money into
3960501 i was in my underwear while i was on the phone so im intending to conduct all future negotiations for finance in my underwear
3960502 i called my office in new york said wow that was easy
3960503 were always having events interpreted by politicians and journalists i wanted to talk to the man on the street and get his perspective about osama and the way they think about america
3960504 some of the most beautiful parts of the movie are ordinary people muslims talking about what they want out of life i wanted the film to give those people a voice
3960505 the people got very upset became physical and there was quite a confrontation
3960506 my producer had to call in the police to get us out of there safely
3960507 it was a schoolboy fantasy come true to be able to fire a rocket launcher
3960508 we had to find out what worked and what didnt i dont think most people read the dense tomes that have been written about osama bin laden
3960509 my goal was to take a lot of information and boil it down into some very simple pieces
3960510 he has become an enigma an ideology that has infiltrated countries around the world
3960511 when you start to see that influence is out there and you see the impact that his ideas have its very disturbing
3960512 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
3960513 were saying the oss was a lot bigger than they were saying
3960514 i know weve been working together and im your boss and you generally do what i say out of deference to me and keep earning your wages but from now on you must consider my word gospel and law and in fact rather than merely working for me you must worship me

3960519 oh god please let there be enough left of me for them to scrape off the floor so my family can bury me
3960520 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3960521 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3960522 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3960523 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3960524 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3960525 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3960526 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3960527 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3960528 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3960529 el mal comportamiento de unos pocos no puede empa ar la enorme contribuci n y sacrificio de los numerosos cascos azules que sirven a la causa de la paz
3960530 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3960531 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3960532 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3960533 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3960534 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3960535 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year
3960536 by increasing the sites relevance to local markets through local language interface translation the site is now competing strongly or even capturing the lead in several markets where it had a relatively minor presence just a year ago
3960537 during the past year many of the top social networking sites have demonstrated rapid growth in their global user bases
3960538 facebooks recent ascension to become the top global social networking site has been spurred by its substantial growth across worldwide regions
3960539 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3960540 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3960541 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3960542 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3960543 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3960544 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3960545 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3960546 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3960547 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3960548 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3960549 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3960550 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3960551 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3960552 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3960553 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3960554 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3960555 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3960556 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3960557 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3960558 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3960559 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3960560 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3960561 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3960562 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3960563 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3960564 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3960565 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3960566 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3960567 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3960568 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3960569 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3960570 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3960571 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3960572 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3960573 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3960574 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3960575 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3960576 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3960577 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3960578 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3960579 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3960580 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3960581 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3960582 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3960583 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3960584 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3960585 who are open to doing something on the production side
3960586 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3960587 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3960588 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3960589 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3960590 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3960591 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3960592 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3960593 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3960594 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3960595 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3960596 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3960597 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3960598 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3960599 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3960600 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3960601 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

3960603 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3960604 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3960605 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

3960615 there is little doubt that the significant decline in inflationary expectations in august is associated with the steep fall in crude oil prices over the last month he said

3960630 por suerte el hambre es cosa del pasado en argentina
3960631 frankly im not so sure that the last rate they put up themselves was justified given that we have seen long term rates coming down a bit
3960632 im pretty sure that there is going to be real pressure to see these rates come down
3960633 lets face facts theres four players most of us bank with the four players and they are all the same
3960634 its a cosy club as soon as one hikes rates up the rest follow thats a cosy club theres not really effective competition at all
3960635 so at least that way you can apply real pressure when you want them to take it down
3960636 with health insurance every year when the premiums go up they must first of all seek approval from the government
3960637 im not going to be responsible for putting in fuelwatch that could actually put prices up and squeeze out independents senator fielding told sky news today
3960638 if the rudd government is absolutely fair dinkum and they think this is going to save motorists money and the nrma in new south wales supports it then lets introduce it in new south wales and if it works then we can roll it out across the country
3960639 assistant treasurer chris bowen he comes from new south wales so if he believes its going to save motorists put it in new south wales and then well see what happens
3960640 i think the government is grasping at straws in trying to get petrol prices down
3960641 family first for two years has been saying that we should be cutting the petrol tax and that will get the petrol prices down
3960642 the rudd government should come out of the closet they should come out and support that now

3960673 it is a problem especially like on a saturday night
3960674 weve had problems with some of our officers just waiting around for a vehicle
3960675 and it seems like we just cant get enough vehicles to help get our officers out there
3960676 we have a bottleneck that we need to improve we have to admit that
3960677 were working to put police marked squad cars as more of a priority
3960678 weve been scouring the workforce trying to get qualified mechanics
3960679 because we have been spending overtime to get the cars out quicker and we have put police marked squad cars as a priority over other types of fleet like sanitation
3960680 competencies maintenance reallocation fleet management its all of that together that needs to be improved in order not to get to this point
3960681 officers were waiting hours they were riding three to a car four to a car
3960682 some officers were not even making it out and doing half their shift what we have currently is nothing close to what was occurring in 2006
3960683 we need to hire more mechanics and hire them as soon as possible and make sure that this doesnt happen again
3960684 the responsibility stops with the council and the city manager
3960685 its our responsibility to ensure that a mechanism is in place for this not to happen again

3960717 more elusive is the deep conversion of mind will and heart where we know the inner reality of being laid hold of by christ in the spirit so we share in his active obedience to communion with and mission from the father
3960718 everybody has something that oppresses them your job as a hospital chaplain is to assist people to bring the feelings from that oppression to the surface and then to draw from within themselves the strength to overcome it you connect with people on the ground of their own agenda and needs ministry means drawing out latent possibilities for healing that lie buried within it is not your job to introduce god language or to provide a theological commentary on the persons situation
3960719 the only mission strategy which will encourage our congregations usefully employ our clergy enable history changing and kingdom of god anticipating ministry and enable us to evangelize with any degree of faithfulness and power is the preaching that there is salvation in no other name
3960720 i remember lying in hospital after cancer surgery wondering what the upcoming six months of chemotherapy would be like and whether i was going to make it through the process what i need now i thought is not a theological treatise to edify my mind though that has its place not some sense that god in christ is in solidarity with me in my suffering and fear though that too is helpful what i need is a god of power i need a god who acts to change things as i cried out save me lord i did not expect any rending of the heavens what i did hear in an inner way was the quiet word of the god who acts it was a voice heard by a lonely fearful pain filled morphine dominated fifty six year old man god said to me that whether i lived or died i did so unto the lord and he would not abandon me not everyone gets healed and that is a great mystery but the promise of his peace is not an empty promise and it is given for all who know him god acts i believe it even when god acts in ways that utterly confounds my xpectations

3960728 ayu kamu nunggu siapa yang lain udah pada pulang tuch
3960729 eh oh nggak nunggu siapa siapa kok aku lagi ngelamunin kamu nggak tahu kenapa akhir akhir ini aku tertarik buat ngelamunin orang madura
3960730 nggak usah bingung kali kita emang menarik buat dilamunin apalagi cowok cakep kayak aku ini
3960731 kamu kok kelihatan bingung gitu wah pasti mau nelur nich ngomong ngomong mau nulis artikel tentang apa yu
3960732 tambah pinter aja kamu din yup kamu bener banget aku lagi bingung mikir artikelku tentang orang madura
3960733 emang ada apa dengan orang madura cantik cantik dan cakep cakep yach
3960734 ye narsis banget sich ntar aja baca sendiri mungkin minggu minggu ini udah kelar kok
3960735 oke dech nggak apa apa kalau emang kamu nggak mau cerita tapi kamu tanggungjawab ya kalau sampai jerawatku tambah banyak abis kamu selalu bikin penasaran
3960736 yu aku pengen ngajak kamu ke camp ikamadu sekarang penting banget jadi nggak bisa ditunda
3960737 tumben kamu kelihatan serius biasanya aja kamu pasang tampang ala tukul arwana
3960738 kalau kamu mau sholat kamu ke belakang aja disana ada kamar mandi dan itu mukenanya di atas rak itu
3960739 tapi sebelumnya aku ingin tahu apa yang bisa kamu tangkap dari tulisanku
3960740 dalam artikelmu kamu menuliskan kekhawatiranmu akan kemungkinan terjadinya pengambilalihan kekuasaan oleh suku madura atas yang lainnya kamu mengatakan demikian karena kamu berkaca pada kasus tragedi sampit bukankah begitu
3960741 ya kamu benar perlu kamu ketahui tulisanku itu bermula dari keherananku atas fenomena yang ada di kampus kita kamu pasti tahu siapa yang dominan di kampus siapa pemimpin bem baik itu bemf maupun bemi bukannya suudzon aku hanya membuat perbandingan saja antara fenomena tersebut dengan tragedi sampit satu tahun silam tepatnya tanggal 17 20 februari 2001 yang melibatkan suku madura dan suku dayak dimana suku maduralah yang pertama melakukan penyerangan
3960742 kamu nggak sepenuhnya salah memang watak orang madura keras tapi perlu kamu ketahui sekeras kerasnya watak kita nggak mungkinlah kita ngelakuin itu kita adalah mahasiswa orang orang yang berpendidikan tinggi dan bermoral kita sadar benar akan pluralitas bangsa kita sedangkan mereka yang terlibat dalam kasus sampit adalah orang orang yang berpendidikan rendah orang pedalaman yang kurang paham tentang moral dan tidak tahu bagaimana hidup rukun berdampingan satu sama lain disinilah kesalahanmu kamu hanya memandang dari satu sisi saja
3960743 oke aku terima argumenmu aku sadar aku salah tapi menurutku sangat tidak menutup kemungkinan orang berpendidikan menjadi otak dalam kasus kerusuhan antar etnis jadi mahasiswapun bagiku bisa melakukan hal serupa
3960744 sangat kecil kemungkinan bagi mahasiswa seperti kita untuk menjadi dalang politik karena terlalu kecil bekal kita untuk bisa masuk dalam permainan politik dalam skop nasional
3960745 kalau boleh tahu dalam tragedi sampit tahun lalu kenapa suku madura tidak bermoral barang sedikitpun buktinya suku dayak telah memperlakukan mereka baik baik suku dayak mau menerima mereka tapi mereka malah melakukan hal hal yang tidak toleran terhadap hampir seluruh aspek kehidupan suku dayak bukankah ini merupakan arogansi budaya suku madura yang memandang remeh budaya lokal suku dayak yang pada akhirnya menimbulkan berbagai gesekan yang mana akumulasi gesekan gesekan tersebut menimbulkan perseteruan dan perkelahian massal yang membesar dan memuncak dari waktu ke waktu
3960746 kamu tadi mengatakan bahwa warga suku dayak mau menerima suku madura siapapun dia nah disinilah letak kesalahannya mereka menerima siapa saja tanpa melakukam seleksi terlebih dahulu
3960747 lantas bagaimana dengan pertimbangan dari tokoh tokoh madura yang menelorkan ancaman ancaman kepada para petinggi pemerintah daerah kalimantan tengah untuk memaksakan kehendak mereka dalam penyelesaian kerusuhan apakah mereka tidak berpikir bahwasanya kalimatan tengahlah yang menjadi korban kelalaian para tokoh tokoh suku madura yang gagal membina warganya yang mencari kehidupan di kalimantan tengah
3960748 itu hanya kebodohan suku dayak mengapa mereka mau dikebiri begitu saja tapi di sisi lain itu juga kesalahan suku madura karena mereka tidak bisa membina warganya dengan baik
3960749 oh ya kamu harus merevisi artikelmu malam ini juga dan besok pagi kamu boleh pulang
3960750 the pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity but the optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty
3960751 iya yach cuma gara gara mereka terlalu rame dan nggak merhatiin pelajaran itu sich udah biasa terjadi tapi nggak tahu kenapa kemarin aku ngerasa ulah mereka itu keterlaluan
3960752 ya udah mulai sekarang coba dech doain mereka setiap usai sholat
3960753 alhamdulillah ya allah engkau maha mendengar dan maha mengabulkan doa hamba mu terimakasih teman kau ingatkan aku yang telah lalai melantunkan doa untuk santri santri
3960754 dan kami tidak mengutus rasul rasul sebelummu melainkan mereka memakan makanan dan berjalan di pasar pasar
3960755 sesungguhnya pernah berkata seorang lelaki kepada nabi saw berilah aku wasiat maka rasulullah menjawab jangan marah lantas orang itu pun mengulanginya lagi hingga beberapa kali dan beliaupun tetap menjawabnya jangan marah
3960756 setiap keletihan penyakit kegelisahan kesedihan perlakuan jahat dan kegalauan yang menimpa seorang muslim hingga duri yang menusuknya sekalipun semua itu akan menyebabkan allah menghapuskan kesalahan dosa dosanya
3960757 kalaupun masih banyak yang lebih mampu dari umi farah bukankah lebih baik umi farah mundur
3960758 memang sih masih ada yang lebih bisa diandalkan tapi aku ngrasa aku juga mampu dan koneksiku juga banyak di fakultas
3960759 oke lah kalau umi farah tetap bersikeras untuk itu aku nggak bisa berbuat apa apa selain mendoakan umi farah
3960760 eh pasya nangis pasti umi salwa kerepotan aku masuk kamar umi salwa dulu ya
3960761 umi farah kamu harus tegar mana umi farah yang kukenal dulu mana umi farah yang nggak pernah menyerah itu umi farah ini semua adalah permainan dalam permainan pasti ada yang menang dan pasti ada yang kalah aku tahu kamu adalah wanita yang tegar dan kamu ikhlas atas kekalahanmu ini namun kamu masih belum bisa terima akan perolehan suara pak subhan yang hanya tiga angka di atas kamu bukan
3960762 sudahlah segala sesuatu pasti ada hikmahnya coba umi farah renungkan ada apa sebenarnya dibalik kekalahan ini allah maha tahu allah tidak akan membebani umat nya diluar kemampuan umat nya mungkin saja kamu belum mampu untuk mengemban tugas berat itu sehingga dia tidak menganugerahkan jabatan ini kepadamu
3960763 em sekarang kita makan dulu yuk kasian anak anak udah nunggu dari tadi
3960764 nisa hari ini dan besok umi farah libur nisa dianter sama umi farah ya nanti disana umi farah nungguin nisa sampai pelajaran selesai
3960765 hore hore umi salwa hari ini nisa dianter sama umi farah

3960779 mass tomorrow is at 9am weve to find a way to wake up that early
3960780 not that i say not going to church anymore is wrong after all to each their own but im quite glad that you still do i think its only because many of the people i know stopped going to church after high school after they stopped getting forced to go
3960781 i dont think i know anyone else who has the same degree of faith as me
3960782 well for one thing ive always believed that god knows what hes doing and that everything he does has a reason
3960783 and even though i cant explain why bad things happen to good people i still believe that he knows what hes doing
3960784 like i believe that god doesnt let us down but why do women get raped or why do babies die or why do good people get conned
3960785 well the way i see it people being humans can only fathom up to a certain extent
3960786 theres this movie that i watched which explained it to me quite well
3960787 theres this one guy who went to a clairvoyant or something
3960788 the woman told him about the future she basically said that he will write a book and he will get published however the book will be a colossal flop and that no one will buy it the woman adds that it is important to still write the book get published and go on with lifes motions even though he already knows about his pending failure twenty years after he dies a little boy will pick up this book and he will be greatly inspired by it the book will inspire him to be a politician and eventually get elected to be the countrys president all because of the book that flopped
3960789 there is a bigger picture out there that is probably too big for us to see we always say look at the bigger picture but we really dont know how big this bigger picture can be so everything that happens may have a direct impact in the future no matter how near or far it is and you know what gods probably the only one who can understand all this
3960790 i understand why people would want to resort to abortion if they got pregnant through rape but you never know a woman might potentially give birth to a scientist that can find the cure for aids or something you just never know
3960791 so god may have his own sordid way of making things work out
3960792 but yeah i also have faith that he knows what hes doing whether or not we like his methodology of it
3960793 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3960794 this is not an attempt to put military assets in closer proximity to inject u s forces into this conflict
3960795 just the mention of toll roads in texas is a call to arms texans are just not in favor of toll roads
3960796 in the end i expect it will be favorable we want this study finished by the time the next water bill is taken up
3960797 just the mention of toll roads in texas is a call to arms texans are just not in favor of toll roads
3960798 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3960799 there are so many wont have enough and their children
3960800 for so many people gas in their tank or at a pantry
3960801 i have people coming to me with masters degrees they cant make ends meet
3960802 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
3960803 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3960804 d d d donkey punch yeah make me taste my lunch i want a donkey punch
3960805 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
3960806 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3960807 ive never felt ive been valued by anyone im just a waste of space that everyone ignores like a ghost without a home
3960808 suede needs to man up i aint got no babies there aint nobody suckin on my titties
3960809 drinking sweetened soft drinks or fruit drinks was associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes
3960810 specifically women who drank two or more soft drinks per day or two or more fruit drinks per day had a 25 to 30 percent increased risk of diabetes drinking diet soft drinks did not increase risk
3960811 reducing consumption of these beverages may be a concrete way to reduce weight gain and prevent diabetes
3960812 fruit drinks which are increasingly being consumed by the u s population are not a healthy alternative to soft drinks at least with regard to risk of type 2 diabetes
3960813 fruit drinks typically contain as many or more calories as soft drinks and like soft drinks may not decrease satiety to the same extent as solid foods
3960814 we have found that eating greater amounts of fruits and vegetables is associated with lower risk of future type 2 diabetes
3960815 we also found an association of eating fruit and vegetables with lower risk of diabetes with a 22 percent reduction of risk of future diabetes in the highest compared to lowest intake of fruits and vegetables
3960816 eating some fruits and vegetables is still better than none in addition the association of fruits and vegetables with reduced diabetes risk gets stronger progressively with the amount of fruits and vegetables eaten the more that you eat the greater the potential benefit
3960817 modest weight loss rather than macronutrient composition may be the dominant predictor of reduced risk of diabetes
3960818 the beauty of a low fat diet that includes lots of vegetables and fruits is that it is sustainable
3960819 an excess of simple sugar tends to be bad for health and to promote both weight gain and the development of diabetes
3960820 an abundant intake of fruits and vegetables defends health and defends against diabetes
3960821 the power of diet has been well established in both diabetes control and prevention the diabetes prevention program demonstrated a 58 percent reduction in the occurrence of diabetes in high risk adults with a balanced wholesome mostly plant based diet in combination with regular physical activity
3960822 but its clear that high fructose corn syrup is not a good actor and its everywhere now
3960823 people who have a lot of beverages with high fructose corn syrup are not compensating by having fewer other calories and it may not function to allow you to feel full he said
3960824 high fructose corn syrup may also cause liver problems and insulin resistance
3960825 at this point all we can say is calories trump everything
3960826 all these high density empty calorie foods that are adding to the caloric load of the population and making it heavier are the real culprits

3960867 reason 1 we are not post modernists we believe there is a right and wrong a good and evil a truth and falsehood the best public education can deliver is an unbiased presentation of the multifaceted views represented in our nation and the world
3960868 furthermore we can instill in them a true love for learning rather than the mercenary attitude that parades as academic excellence in too many public school overachievers
3960869 we are christians not secular humanists despite all the talk about separation of church and state there is a religious view being taught in public schools it is the religion of secularism
3960870 todays christians know they do not as their ancestors did live in a society where gods presence was unavoidable no longer does christianity form the moral basis of society many of us now reside in secular communities where arguments drawn from the bible or christian revelation carry no weight and where we hear different language from that spoken in church instead of engaging this secular world most christians have taken the easy way out they have retreated into a christian subculture where they engage christian concerns then they step back into secular society where their christianity is kept out of sight until the next church service without realizing it christians have become postmodernists of a sort they live by the gospel of two truths there is a religious truth reserved for sundays and days of worship and there is secular truth which applies the rest of the time this divided lifestyle is opposed to what the bible teaches the bible tells christians not be of the world sharing its distorted priorities but it does call upon believes to be in the world fully engaged

3960930 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
3960931 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3960932 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3960933 he is not from another planet he is from the future

3960986 ive lived with rats since 1958 honey when i got the house in 1958 thats the day i started feeding all the animals and i fed them as long as i lived there
3960987 i wonder if ive been to wherever shes talking about
3960988 i dont think there are more than 250 tigers in the sundarbans now
3960989 the fate of the sundarbans is inextricably linked to the fate of its wildlife the problem is that those whose lives it saves act as its worst enemy if the tigers die the sundarbans will die if the sundarbans die bangladesh will die too
3960990 poachers timber merchants and shrimp farmers have built up an unholy nexus of corruption with the rangers forest officers and politically influential people
3960991 people should be made aware of the need for keeping the tigers and the forest alive the international community and ngos can play a leading role in this effort but we dont see them coming forward to do this
3960992 the death of a goat or a chicken is a major loss for a poor farmer or fisherman so he wouldnt pardon the tiger for doing that moreover tigers are considered predators it will take many years before people begin to think they and the wildlife are on the same boat of existence
3960993 too many of these small coastal cetaceans end up as bycatch in fisheries
3960994 this remains the main threat to them and it is only going to get worse
3960995 large parts of the oceans are now filled with human generated noise not only from military sonar but also from seismic surveys and shipping this noise undoubtedly affects many cetaceans in some cases leading to their death
3960996 it may not always kill whales and dolphins but it affects their ability to communicate and it can drive them away at least temporarily from their feeding grounds
3960997 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the act
3960998 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3960999 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3961000 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3961001 over the years the endangered species act has become a regulatory nightmare that kills or stalls even the most well crafted land use projects
3961002 the economy suffers people suffer rational environmental planning suffers some careful streamlining is long overdue
3961003 it sure smells pretty and its beautiful too thats why i picked it here its for you
3961004 the large whales the commercially important ones have for the most part responded well under protection
3961005 we would hope that some of the decisions might be reconsidered
3961006 there have been many moments at the iwc this year when debate was not directly linked to stocks
3961007 while some species have started to recover none of them are back to the levels they had before industrial whaling started
3961008 overall nearly a quarter of cetacean species are considered threatened nine species are listed as endangered or critically endangered
3961009 they put rice on the pedestal to keep him fed the incense from god to keep the smell for him to come home
3961010 im finding satisfaction in the fact that we were able to help a family get their family member back and have some closure for them

3961021 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3961022 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community help the poverty hit afghan people
3961023 reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted in this way
3961024 nothing can justify such an attack on people whose lives are devoted to helping the people of afghanistan
3961025 humanitarian workers should be protected by the principles of neutrality and impartiality and must not be targeted as they appear to be at present in afghanistan
3961026 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
3961027 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001
3961028 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
3961029 thoughtful and rigorous debate might be the ultimate moral act

3961056 entahlah kenapa kemaren itu dia tidak berbicara apapun cuman bertanya tentang perempuan yang lewat dan jus jeruk dan sedikit tentang foto janin bener bener ngejelimet ya pak
3961057 segitiga kemaren adelia kaget berat waktu kata itu mengalir begitu aja dari mulutku pasti dia tahu sesuatu cuman enggak mau ngomong apa kita mesti cari perempuan yang ditunjuk aurelia kemaren pak
3961058 aku pikir kemaren yang datang cuman perempuan yang pengen diramal biasa aja terus bayar mahal atas ramalanku terus menghilang pergi eh enggak tahunya ngejelimet begini apa sebaiknya kita gak usah ambil pusing soal ini semua pak atau kita lupain aja kalau kita pernah bertemu dengan aurelia dan adelia ini kita kan bukan detektif atau polisi bagaimana pak
3961059 seenaknya saja kamu pikir segampang itu aku akan terus dikejar mimpi yang sama terus menerus jika hal ini belum bisa terpecahkan kamu itu dari dulu kan sudah aku beri tahu efek auramu itu mengarah langsung padaku
3961060 na inget kan kemaren aurelia menunjuk jus jeruk kamu dan dia bilang suaminya senang sekali jus jeruk ingat
3961061 sudah aku bilang aku gak mau tahu lagi urusan tentang aurelia atau keluarganya
3961062 ceritakan apa yang terjadi di mesir maka kamu akan bebas dari saya dan rekan saya
3961063 kalau berhenti sampai disini apa mimpi kamu tentang piramida dan aurelia akan hilang
3961064 kalau aku sih oke aja lagian ini kan urusannya ribet banget biarkan aurelia pergi dengan tenang kita kan ga ada kewajiban untuk masuk lebih ke dalam
3961065 hapus air mata kamu na kamu masih sama saja dari dulu
3961066 tiba tiba aku teringat huru hara kemarin di kota yang lama pak
3961067 ada sms masuk besok ada klien yang mau ketemu kamu jam 9 pagi

3961090 aku tahu huahmm tadi aurelia dan adelia aurelia cuman bicara tentang jus jeruk katanya dulu jus jeruk itu kesukaan suaminya huahm lalu adelia cuman menanyakan apa aja yang aurelia katakan padaku aku bilang tidak ada selain tentang jus jeruk saja
3961091 dia sudah agak baikan mungkin dia kecapekan di tk dia senang bener lari lari dengan temannya
3961092 segitiga yang lebih rumit ada kekecewaan kesedihan keriangan dan kesenangan yang luar biasa juga

3961094 karena yang kutangkap adalah adelia sangat tidak menyukai aurelia dia benci sekali aurelia tahu sesuatu tentang adelia aku gak bermaksud melindungi aurelia tapi rasanya segala sesuatu tentang dia membuatku menangis terharu
3961095 yang and jiang have high potential and i think they can confront shawn johnson
3961096 this is a competition its fair play so i really hope these members can do their utmost so the public and the whole world of gymnastics can see their best performance
3961097 i feel they really are the best gymnasts at this tournament the best complete gymnasts
3961098 i have predicted the outcome either me first her second or her first me second either way we will push each other hard and we are ready to go and fight together
3961099 i can only hope and pray usa will come out on top
3961100 its going to be great knowing that i have my team mate right there helping me and ill be helping her too of course she and i are both going for gold you dont work to go for a silver
3961101 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
3961102 i think hes undisputedly the greatest swimmer of all time
3961103 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
3961104 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
3961105 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3961106 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3961107 he is not from another planet he is from the future
3961108 being on the team with him these past couple of years a lot of us take what he does for granted
3961109 people need to be waking up to the realities of the world and that the days of easy money have come to a pretty sudden end
3961110 there is an awful lot of talk about big transfers and major demands of players but you will find throughout the uk and europe that money is not quite as easy to obtain as it used to be
3961111 were expecting the levels of transfer fees this summer to still to be quite high but probably not as high as the record that was set last summer
3961112 euro 2008 happened towards the start of the summer transfer window
3961113 the level of transfer activity at the start of a window sometimes decreases when there is a major tournament taking place
3961114 another factor is that the 2008 09 season is the second year of a three year broadcast deal and the level of broadcasting revenues to clubs this year will be broadly similar to what they received last year
3961115 so were not seeing a step change in the amount of revenues that clubs are getting year on year
3961116 another point is weve not seen anything like the number of changes in club ownership in the last 12 months compared to the previous 12 months premier league clubs for whom this window is their first opportunity to buy and sell players so i think thats another factor
3961117 in hebrew it is not at all uncommon to repeat elements of a sentence for emphasis
3961118 i didnt see anything overly compelling for me in the genesis sample
3961119 i can win an argument on any topic against any opponent people know this and steer clear of me at parties often as a sign of their great respect they dont even invite me
3961120 most people are other people their thoughts are someone elses opinions their lives a mimicry their passions a quotation
3961121 it seems to be growing the market rather than cannibalizing existing pc sales
3961122 it helps us from nuisance lawsuits if someone moves next to us and all of a sudden they didnt like the cows mooing at the right to farm law says thats a natural thing just because you move in we cant stop it
3961123 the farms are disappearing and were trying to keep some of them around they do feed us

3961128 dramadramatic ridges and valleys of dust serpent head pillars of creation and gaseous filaments glowing fiercely under torrential ultraviolet radiation
3961129 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
3961130 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
3961131 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
3961132 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
3961133 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
3961134 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
3961135 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem
3961136 the people that are off the island the island seems to be drawing them back and ben michael emerson makes it clear they need to go back to the island
3961137 so hopefully thats a lot of what youll see of in season 5 the journey of how those six return to the island
3961138 all australians will enjoy the cultural benefits which will flow from the projects that receive these funds the dance festivals music television and radio productions the arts and crafts and the revival and strengthening of our indigenous languages

3961142 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3961143 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3961144 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3961145 we want to continue to be able to provide excellent ambulance service
3961146 people seem to be very happy with the ambulance service and people seem to be interested in paying maybe 4 a month
3961147 its a win win situation for a lot of people
3961148 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3961149 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3961150 im hoping for a facebook application that helps me relearn conversation skills
3961151 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3961152 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3961153 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3961154 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3961155 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3961156 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3961157 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3961158 is australia so insecure and wracked with such an inferiority complex that we have to trumpet about the greatest inventions we have produced even when they are mostly extremely lame
3961159 liesbeth soeterbroek from amsterdam i started dressme 3 years ago after my son was born thats him in the logo as a fashion designer i wanted to make unique clothes for him so i started to make fun clothes out of recycled fabrics three years and hundreds of t shirts and dresses later i still love making clothes for babies and toddlers to wear and enjoy
3961160 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3961161 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3961162 baynes went on to become one of the foremost childrens book illustrators of the 20th century her highly designed style witty inventive and invariably bursting beyond the borders of the page her strong sense of colour and line and her careful attention to detail would become instantly recognisable as for narnia despite other artists ringing the changes from time to time with the covers sometimes disastrously it is her classic line drawings which have remained an integral part of every subsequent edition of the series

3961167 im now convinced that a large segment of the charismatic church will follow the anti christ when he shows up because they have no discernment

3961170 why cigars are so cheap in havana that you can buy a dozen for a dime
3961171 he had a lot of emotional issues before this because his mom was in prison for drug and alcohol related offenses and apparently there was sexual abuse early in his life
3961172 he wasnt exactly in the best of shape emotionally before this and the events surrounding what happened have exacerbated it he has a hard time communicating verbally

3961174 comics have always been an integral part of who we are and these awards will allow us to honor the great work for kids being produced in graphic novels today
3961175 our readers consistently rave about the comic book section as one of their favorites so awards are a natural direction for the magazine

3961205 i see no reason why the court shouldnt act in accordance with the wishes of the parties
3961206 i dont much like it when people align themselves with caesar and then complain that hes acting too roman for their tastes and since catholic insight does accept heritage canada money they have unfortunately opened themselves to this state of affairs one never gets to lead when one takes caesar as a dance partner
3961207 while catholic insight has the right to present religious or political views on the issues of same sex marriage and homosexuality as a sexual choice or lifestyle any denigrating content that is specifically directed towards that is specifically directed towards homosexual men and women could potentially render it ineligible for support by by our programs
3961208 we dont want to make people feel like were exclusive to christians
3961209 our songs are about things that everybody can relate to from christians to atheists to anything in between our songs cover love heartache being afraid of whats going on in the world after 9 11 anyone can be dealing with those things
3961210 i dont know when it began to be made but people are looking to bridge that gap comatose is one of those transition records thats a really positive thing its a way help christian music in general and to get the message out there people are more open to hearing about it when its not slammed in their faces
3961211 ive heard people say they were a little taken aback by all the energy we have on stage
3961212 its a high impact dynamic show the music isnt just in your face rock theres a pop influence that comes across in our concerts as well
3961213 we were one of the only christian artists of this genre when we came out
3961214 because of that our fans were really really loyal and so happy with our sound that they would follow us around they would bring skillets to the show people still do its kind of become a thing its kind of nice
3961215 working with a project there are costs involved selling projects will result in profit or losses so theres economics

3961218 junior fair comes down on their shoulders problems are theirs to resolve
3961219 harness racing is probably the first and most traditional entertainment that county fairs have offered over the years
3961220 were still one of the premiere county fair racetracks probably in the nation but certainly in ohio we attract the best of ohios horses to our racing its still a great sport to watch
3961221 you get a chance to do a little legal wagering even though we dont have a casino you can come out and add a little skill to it
3961222 its not just pulling a handle you can try to decipher which horse is going to have a good night
3961223 the trotter has to have one foot on the ground at all times the pace two feet on the right go forward at the same time and then two feet on the left go forward at the same time
3961224 weve had the dunlap renner memorial pace for at least 30 years at one time it was our only really truly feature race it was our big race
3961225 then 14 years ago harold breidenbach and the late jim chapman started the super trot because there wasnt a race like that anywhere for older trotters it spawned a whole series called the signature series across west central ohio
3961226 we started doing it years ago because people would come to town and in the evenings they would do it in parking lots
3961227 we decided to organize something so they would have a venue instead of having the police and hotel owners kick them out
3961228 its the best of three pulls on concrete much like tug of war
3961229 shortly after we started restoring it the original stained glass windows were stolen
3961230 theyd even pulled some of the fireplace bases off and had them sitting in the middle of the room
3961231 my immediate concern is security since this is a historic property
3961232 they were just part of that era when architecture went to extremes
3961233 it was in real bad shape when we started and we did a tremendous amount of work
3961234 it was challenging and at first we had a very good time
3961235 the neighborhood makes it really difficult to keep the house up
3961236 as happens in that neighborhood unfortunately when new ownerships are not quite as fit as the previous one its downward step by step and thats what happened here
3961237 its another for the inspections department to have the manpower to get out there and actually do it
3961238 i think it has a great chance of being sold
3961239 i hope it will appeal to a preservationist who will restore it
3961240 area homemakers and seamstresses are invited to make outfits either for themselves or for a friend of child

3961244 this day is important to the fair and to me because women need to be recognized
3961245 it helps to teach kids basic principles like sewing and shows that these skills are still important and that people still do it

3961253 mama jaymes is doing quite well also the aiken family the foster family and the parker family are all thrilled
3961254 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
3961255 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
3961256 points to a lapse in the companys risk management and control process
3961257 in addition the growing scope of riskier unregulated activities a financial profile that has improved but still lags our expectations and the likelihood that the companys discretionary cash flow position will remain negative through 2009 contributed to a downgrade
3961258 this company is not generating cash and yet most investors if you were to ask them would tell you that theyre valuing the company based on forecasted cash flow
3961259 i would simply caution people to understand those numbers better before making a commitment
3961260 in the big picture its an attempt to engage the health and medical communities with web technology something that is only beginning today
3961261 incredibles 1 5 story line the story also mentions that this is part of a larger line of pixar film based comics sounds like a cool idea to me

3961266 the second quarter proved to be challenging on a number of fronts given the weak economic environment and recent revenue results were taking a conservative stance and lowering our guidance for percentage revenue growth for 2008 from mid teens to 9 to 11
3961267 weve made considerable progress toward completing our platform investments and upgrades we expect the changes were implementing today will support sustained long term growth and profitability in the years to come

3961279 it was really the brainchild of ubisoft and them working with our integrations team and sales development team
3961280 we assess every title on our network for ad relevance and work with the publishers to make it happen if a game is set too far in the future or is historical or is a fantasy piece we pass on it assuming the game can be integrated with ads we look for placements that work in the games environment were looking to not over commercialize the looking to find the best placements in the game as we look at it we want to put in about five to six minutes of ads for every hour of gameplay that players experience the reality is that we want placements that catch the players eye and dont saturate the environment
3961281 through the integrations weve already worked into the game weve tagged placement for ads before hand we didnt have to re architect the game at all
3961282 ubisoft worked with ad packaging on the idea we just had to put together a series of events that was compelling to the gamer and the marketer as well and it just works well for the sku in all ways it worked out perfectly
3961283 it makes such a good fit for paramount because of the way the movie and game match up
3961284 promotions like this can be done in numerous markets this could be done in consumer package goods to soft drinks paramount is one of our first advertising partners and one of our most consistent customers the stars aligned the paramount team loves innovation and firsts and trying new things and then also ubisoft has been one of our best if not most progressive publishing partners i think weve carried six clancy games and its because they not only create great games but also because theyve been early in their adoption of dynamic ads

3961288 funding costs for the banks across all sources had probably fallen by about 25 to 30 basis points in recent weeks he told a federal parliamentary committee hearing in sydney
3961289 people have been pushing the banks to give more commitment to the fact that they would follow the
3961290 the banks have responded to that quite cautiously and have been quite non committal
3961291 my guess is really whats happening here is the banks are saying well its unreasonable for them to give commitments when they dont know when the rba is going to move or by how much
3961292 thats why we now find we are in a position to cut interest rates mr battellino added
3961293 we cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late mr battellino said
3961294 overall when we look at all the evidence which we have its reasonable to conclude that the australian financial sector is competitive and that it stacks up quite well across a range of international benchmarks
3961295 our view is that these recent events are cyclical in nature and do not represent permanent change to the structure of the market in the sense that when markets settle we expect securitisation to pick up again mr battellino said

3961334 more than a million blogs have emerged during the last few years
3961335 power of attorney now she is giving it all to me i just found all of this tonight and i dont know how to comprehend all of this information starting in the morning i have to make life changing calls for my dad
3961336 past is history the future is a mystery and the now is a gift because its the present
3961337 ive been told by doctors and surgeons that i have the energy of ten men who have normal jobs
3961338 when you get launched into your imaginatory vagueness your foresight will become a nimble vagrant
3961339 sometimes your imagination will make you think that something that cuts hay is really a soft knit sweater
3961340 your imagination is the hood ornament on your car of creativity
3961341 my dark side my shadow my lower companion is now in the back room blowing up balloons for kids parties
3961342 imagine the peace symbol the peace symbol has three pieces in it one piece is emotion thats your body another piece has spirit in it thats your fuel another piece has intellect in it and thats your steering wheel you can never overdo the fuel that goes into the body which is the emotions and the steering wheel to drive it
3961343 technology is like living with the eyes of a shark
3961344 ive been out of my body at multiple times and so i know that place is haunted
3961345 fear is the dark room where the devil develops his negatives
3961346 art is only the search its not the final form

3961350 lets buy this so we can be even more chained to our possessions maybe we should get two that way we can be landlocked even if one breaks
3961351 consumers shouldnt have to worry about tracking devices being sewn into the seams of their clothing or pressed into the soles of their shoes
3961352 we are putting apparel and rfid companies on notice that consumers will protest any item level use of rfid on apparel
3961353 consumer awareness and opposition to rfid has grown exponentially since 2003
3961354 any u s company foolish enough to use rfid on apparel will face stiff repercussions
3961355 the people hired in an improper way did not themselves do anything wrong it therefore would be unfair and quite possibly illegal given their civil service protections to fire or reassign them without individual cause
3961356 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3961357 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3961358 it would have ill served the public interest not to appoint him merely because those who first hired him had violated the civil service laws
3961359 which is easiest for someone your age to buy cigarettes beer marijuana or prescription drugs such as oxycontin percocet vicodin or ritalin without a prescription
3961360 maybe there should be a lock on the medicine cabinet now
3961361 half of the teenagers were saying they were out on school nights but only 14 percent of the parents knew that they were out
3961362 there are lots of factors at play here parents are not paying attention there are parents who are out in the evening themselves there are parents out at work
3961363 prescription drugs are entrenched and they have not moved for five years and this generation of parents simply do not understand the problem
3961364 where ivins could have possibly stored this anthrax without any employees seeing it or if he took it home why there was no trace
3961365 politically whites will be much more interested in issues like health care and pensions
3961366 at the same time the growing minority population hispanics especially will be concerned about more youthful issues like schools
3961367 what this population rise means to me is anywhere from 40 to 80 million more cars on the road 35 to 40 million more houses built
3961368 this bold experiment is pushing the boundaries and raising many questions

3961372 ive had a wonderful trip this week i started off by having a chance to go to the olympic games opening ceremony and see a lot of those games which were fantastically managed
3961373 it really is a milestone which shows the world the opportunities we have if we all work together and have places like hong kong and china which will be such an important part of the future
3961374 i also will get to spend some time here and see the olympic events and then go back up to beijing and see more there
3961375 people often talk about this as the internet service revolution
3961376 that will eventually lead to machines that have lots of server capacity lots of low cost computing low cost storage and that will let us write software in an even more ambitious way eliminating the last constraints we have
3961377 the white population is older and very much centered around the who are well past their high fertility years
3961378 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
3961379 eye has not seen nor ear heard nor have entered into the heart of man the things which god has prepared for those who love him
3961380 but why do you call me lord lord and not do the things which i say
3961381 listen behold a sower went out to sow 4 and it happened as he sowed that some seed fell by the wayside and the birds of the air 5 some fell on stony ground where it did not have much earth and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth 6 but when the sun was up it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away 7 and some seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no crop 8 but other seed fell on good ground and yielded a crop that sprang up increased and produced some thirtyfold some sixty and some a hundred
3961382 to you it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of god but to those who are outside all things come in parables
3961383 do you not understand this parable how then will you understand all the parables 15 and these are the ones by the wayside where the word is sown when they hear satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts 16 these likewise are the ones sown on stony ground who when they hear the word immediately receive it with gladness 17 and they have no root in themselves and so endure only for a time afterward when tribulation or persecution arises for the words sake immediately they stumble 18 now these are the ones sown among thorns they are the ones who hear the word 19 and the cares of this world the deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things entering in choke the word and it becomes unfruitful 20 but these are the ones sown on good ground those who hear the word accept it and bear fruit some thirtyfold some sixty and some a hundred
3961384 does this offend you 62 what then if you should see the son of man ascend where he was before 63 it is the spirit who gives life the flesh profits nothing the words that i speak to you are spirit and they are life 64 but there are some of you who do not believe
3961385 therefore i have said to you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted to him by my father
3961386 its there for anybody to come look enjoy and make an offer
3961387 timing isnt the best given the softness of the market but were undeterred
3961388 now you have a huge limitation in the soils and geology of the site
3961389 i understand their point of view but i just think it wasnt realistic
3961390 it faces a highway it isnt on a primary bluff
3961391 were trying to give them an overview of what were trying to do in benson schools and what were trying to improve at
3961392 each person brings different ways to be successful and we can learn from that
3961393 they bring such a diverse background and can enhance our current staff
3961394 we congratulate all of the award recipients for their wonderful achievement
3961395 we are honored that all ten winners prepared for the exam using becker cpa review and are proud of the comprehensive materials and expert instruction we provide all of our students to help them succeed on the exam
3961396 i would sincerely hope that the italian parliament would pass this law
3961397 we athletes go through major sacrifices to get to this level it would be the right thing to do to remove the taxes from what we get here it would be a very good thing

3961404 the blessing of the lord it maketh rich and he addeth no sorrow with it
3961405 he was able to take my anger away when i gave it to him he was able to take the depression away he even took the loneliness away eventually grow closer to god and as you start to dwell on him and the things of god you forget all the things that hurt and he will take your loneliness away
3961406 hes always available to you he says i will never leave you or forsake you but you have to make the decision to have a relationship with god nobody else can do it for you you must say i want to be saved i repent of my sins i ask you to forgive me of my sins and cleanse me from all unrighteousness i accept jesus christ as my lord and savior thats a positive action that can result from immense pain
3961407 whoever drinks the water i give him will never thirst indeed the water i give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life

3961410 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year
3961411 by increasing the sites relevance to local markets through local language interface translation the site is now competing strongly or even capturing the lead in several markets where it had a relatively minor presence just a year ago
3961412 almost got the glass to the counter then dropped it
3961413 do your best to be responsive to others without actually being responsible for them your charm and self confidence will attract members of the opposite sex today if you are not currently in a relationship now is a great time to start one you deserve the best so dont settle for anything less retain your right to refuse service to anyone if you are having difficulty sleeping it could be because you have too much on your mind lighten your mental load and you will find inner peace let other people come to your side

3961421 from day one weve been way ahead of last year
3961422 we are working on timing of plays that we are running a lot of which we didnt run against baltimore
3961423 all those things were kind of on the hit parade and we will continue to work on those things about 20 of the time and the other 80 will be geared towards things that tampa bay does

3961430 o que despertou a minha vontade de falar sobre a biografia e tamb m a rela o de paulo coelho com o raul foram as entrevistas que venho assistindo dele inclusive na veja falando sobre drogas e magia negra como os motivos do afastamento dos dois como raul seixas n o est aqui para se defender me sinto sufocado ao observar e ter que assistir tudo isso calado
3961431 quem iniciou o raul nessa hist ria toda de magia negra foi o pr prio paulo coelho agora ele vir dizer o contr rio e raul n o est aqui para se defender duro
3961432 como raul tinha uma filha pequena e estava sem renda foi um momento importante para ele o trabalho na gravadora foi um despertar da sua m sica
3961433 lembro que raul come ou a ficar agressivo e a alquimia entre os dois tornou se algo explosivo e arrogante eles come aram a ter id ias de querer salvar o mundo ou domin lo
3961434 raul sempre seria o raul seixas independente de qualquer um mas o paulo coelho nunca seria quem ele hoje esse grande vendedor de livros sem a exist ncia de raul seixas foi raul quem abriu as portas para que paulo pudesse conhecer editoras e se colocar no mundo como escritor
3961435 eles come aram a n o mais se suportar lembro que raul dizia que paulo era materialista demais e isso angustiava muito ele
3961436 ele era muito apaixonado por discos voadores e a aproxima o de raul em paulo foi exclusivamente essa saber mais sobre os extraterrestres
3961437 lembro muito bem que cheguei na casa do raul fui recebido pela esposa dele e eles estavam com a filha de tr s meses na poca
3961438 lembro disso como se fosse hoje e tudo para raul era estranho quem mais falava na casa era o paulo
3961439 ele n o parava de falar e a repeti o sobre o assunto foi tamanha que eu comprei um exemplar do livro
3961440 gosto muito da lembran a dele em mim apesar das dist ncias
3961441 na minha idade os beatles j eram conhecidos no planeta e eu ainda n o sou ningu m n o passo de um merda
3961442 if you are a student god wants you to excel in all your examinations
3961443 bragged to shareholders about how the banks record profit was the result of its
3961444 i think if you make approval for that park or sports complex youre calling a park we see it more as a sports complex i think youre going to be putting my daughter in danger along with the other children in the neighborhood
3961445 if the village followed its open space and recreation plan and called this a neighborhood park and used it as a neighborhood park the residents wouldnt be here but thats not what this is this is a high density high impact sports complex
3961446 there was a question of if pop warner the village and the neighbors if we were willing to meet to try and iron out some of the issues express some of the concerns and have a forum so we could have a round table on it and we are open to that idea
3961447 a motion should be made to send it back to staff to either instruct for a meeting or to get a different layout for this site that can be lived with

3961478 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
3961479 his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him
3961480 we have experienced strong demand on this route since we started it earlier this year the additional frequencies will mean that we are offering more choice for travellers at our famous low low fares
3961481 we have new lands from the icy but rather festive nordberg where minions face up to vicious seals to a new magic sanctuary domain where the magical creatures have retreated from the onslaught of the empire to the homelands and cities of the glorious empire itself
3961482 from the netherworld you rise to gather an army of loyal minions that are more destructive and much smarter than before now they can do even more things for their master such as riding mounts using war machines and sailing warships in world changing battles
3961483 were really excited about shifting the world to a new era where a roman inspired empire rises as the arch enemy of the overlord
3961484 did i ever tell you about the time i was pounded by pooh san lemme tell you it was like pooh san was cracked up on honey withdrawal
3961485 oito ou oitenta e os outros 71 quase nunca interessam
3961486 we went to give our psychological support to the ex president who is going through a bad moment
3961487 wow this site looks awesome and i can navigate through it very easily
3961488 this site looks horrible but boy is this coding job awesome
3961489 hell yeah im gonna get a fortune out of this idiot
3961490 oh no no no no no no thats not possible
3961491 it seemed like their date night would be coming to school board meetings
3961492 we have a terrific school district but theres always room for improvement
3961493 i think hell be a great addition to the board
3961494 hes one of those parents that have always stayed very engaged
3961495 it was higher than anyone expected for a summer election
3961496 theres no indication that any of the aliens were involved in any terrorist activity at all
3961497 ice agents were stationed at the security gate and we reviewed all the identity documents of all the people entering at that moment
3961498 when we determined that the alienage or identity of someone inside a vehicle was in question we recommended further inspection
3961499 this is a critical sensitive facility so of course we pay particular attention to it
3961500 its one of the highest priorities of the department of homeland security
3961501 our understanding is that ice has been interrogating the workers without legal counsel despite the fact that an attorney has been literally knocking on the door to get in to help them
3961502 some of these workers are likely to have viable legal claims to stay in the united states
3961503 they may qualify for asylum they may have pending immigration applications but if they are moved away from their families who are the only ones likely to find them legal help the likelihood that they will find legal representation is very slim
3961504 it would have been more than 30 000 for the academic year and that doesnt count summer right
3961505 but theres a big caveat here and thats that weve never experienced the perfect storm before rising tuitions well beyond inflation in a recessionary climate with a shrinking school age population
3961506 for michelle rhee or anyone to ask that is like judas and 30 pieces of silver
3961507 at this school i think any of us could excel in that kind of a scenario
3961508 politically whites will be much more interested in issues like health care and pensions
3961509 at the same time the growing minority population hispanics especially will be concerned about more youthful issues like schools
3961510 what this population rise means to me is anywhere from 40 to 80 million more cars on the road 35 to 40 million more houses built
3961511 he grabbed me on my throat hit me in my head
3961512 i started thinking of the last time he did that he suffocated me so i grabbed a knife and i stabbed him he was hitting me on my head cussing me telling me he was going to kill me
3961513 although she had engaged in some self injury to her arm no she did not meet those criteria
3961514 i was not able to contact the police and breach confidentiality
3961515 i can only do that when theres evidence that she intends serious injury to self or others
3961516 asked me did i know how to drive because he didnt want me to witness him killing her
3961517 i have a problem sitting still sometimes so i got up and left
3961518 there has been so little done in terms of remedying problems its an outrage

3961538 bringing up geeks how to protect you kids childhood in a grow up too fast world
3961539 there is a fine jewish proverb man thinks god laughs inspired by the adage i like to imagine fran ois rabelais heard gods laughter one day and thus was born the first great european novel it pleases me to think that the art of the novel came into the world as the echo of gods laughter
3961540 no peace is possible between the novelist and the ag laste never having heard gods laughter the ag lastes are convinced the truth is obvious but it is precisely in losing the certainty of truth and the unanimous agreement of others that man becomes an individual the novel is the imaginary paradise of individuals it is that territory where no one possesses the truth but where everyone has the right to be understood
3961541 the art inspired by gods laughter does not by nature serve ideological certainties it contradicts them like penelope it undoes each night the tapestry that the theologians philosophers and learned men have woven the day before
3961542 the enlightenment is under threat so is reason so is truth so is science we have to devote a significant proportion of our time and resources to defending it from deliberate attack from organised ignorance we even have to go on the attack ourselves for the sake of reason and sanity
3961543 you could have murder where you go out and shoot someone or you could have a crime of passion
3961544 how to be david copperfield a critique of lockes personal identity model
3961545 through brute facts and brute numbers that we get this subsidised degree thats probably going to get us good jobs and its not obvious how were giving back to society
3961546 in britain or america you have a system where abstract knowledge is reserved for a certain community you have to go to certain schools to get it and live in certain neighbourhoods and its assumed that lower income communities only need to learn skills
3961547 we were a bit nervous at the beginning about how this would come across to the kids and whether wed get a hostile reaction or not
3961548 but we did have people on the inside in schools who could say thats inappropriate or theyll really like that
3961549 i thought the advantage of having undergrads do it is partly that theyre closer to the school experience having us come in from a different generation and rather formal wed probably have gone into normal lecturing mode and that probably wouldnt be the right level as long as we had the right support which we did i was pretty confident that it would work and it did
3961550 if theyre going to die in prison why not just kill them
3961551 if you punish someone you could make them mad so theyll do something worse
3961552 wont people find out that if they do something wrong theyll be let off but if they dont theyll go to prison
3961553 theyre interesting because they make you think and theyre not like other lessons which are just full of facts and things youve got to remember
3961554 to look at things differently in a way i like it
3961555 its always good to be challenged and they have been its good for them to talk to different people theyve enjoyed it they like active learning
3961556 they need to know there is this subject and they need to know what it is theres no reason why philosophy as a subject in itself cant be taught in schools and i think it should be and not just for sixth formers
3961557 what the schools require and what the volunteers we have are comfortable teaching
3961558 we have a few set lesson plans that usually work very well for any age group usually its very interactive what weve generally done is a very short presentation at the beginning of the main issues and then prompt them with some questions and get them to go into groups discuss them and give feedback
3961559 there is a tradition in philosophy maybe starting with socrates
3961560 in which theres this sense that you can have an education which is perhaps not the normal type of education which provides certain basic skills but one which provides you with a capacity for reasoning and a taste for things which are not available everywhere that can be the drive for anybody to go on and study greater things
3961561 the only reason im now doing philosophy at university why im involved in this project
3961562 is that after that we did a little thing about formal thinking and logic
3961563 the amount that were going to change their future lives is going to be reasonably minimal unless they take it up as an academic career or something like that but youll have introduced them to something worthwhile just by giving them a new way of thinking about things
3961564 i do it because i like the look of bewilderment on their faces when you question something they thought was a given
3961565 philosophy does give people skills but they dont recognise it and i think doing some of the teaching makes them realise they can do things and there are skills they can one day put on a cv but not in an artificial way
3961566 when we did the first big recruitment drive i went along fully prepared to sell it not as a selfless thing
3961567 but that it does a lot for us it gives us teaching experience it gives us something to put on our cv it counts towards the sheffield graduate award it can help you understand philosophy better i was ready to sell it on all these grounds and i dont think theres anything necessarily wrong with doing it for those reasons but we didnt have to because people were willing to do it just for selfless reasons
3961568 theres a worry that theres a core of enthusiasts who have seen it through but are going to be leaving and will it all then peter out one thing is to ensure a succession and structures that can continue and pass on from year to year this is the first year of real change of that sort and i think things are in place for next year and it will continue
3961569 there is something paradoxical in the view that the conservative should be the outsider
3961570 that is just part of the to and fro of public life
3961571 which is to bring philosophy and culture back together so that the study of philosophy moves back from being the handmaiden of the sciences as its tended to be in british empiricism and also modern analytical philosophy to being a meditation on the human condition which borders on literature art music and the rest thats always been my interest which is why i started by doing research on aesthetics
3961572 connected to a sort of cultural conservatism of the ts eliot type which moved me at a certain stage in a political direction thats to say i became like many people of my generation very disillusioned with the post war socialist consensus and began looking for other things its never been a primary interest but i became interested in how to articulate the message about some form of intellectual conservatism for the age in which we live
3961573 i only wrote it because ted honderich asked me to
3961574 penguin thought that they should publish something on conservatism at the time which was 1979 i think a long time ago and ted looked around and racked his brains for anybody he could think of who was a conservative he hit on me and that launched me on another career in a way as a spokesman for a certain position
3961575 first of all conservatism isnt goal directed in the way that socialism is and some though not all forms of liberalism are
3961576 thats a much more difficult thing to do i think than to articulate a forward looking socialist doctrine if you look at marx in particular he says almost nothing about the communist future its just an abstraction everything is about how hateful this and this is in the present and anyway history is going to sweep it away my view is that is morally irresponsible and that really one must begin from an understanding of the virtues and the defects of the thing that one has
3961577 well someone like rawls is looking for an abstract unifying principle of justification which he calls justice and in my view completely distorts the concept of justice in order to do this i would say your relation to the social order in which youre brought up is comparable to your relation to your family its full of imperfections tensions and so on but its not something for which an abstract justification is needed if it is to go on it is the given to use the wittgensteinian mode of looking at it the important thing is to know how to adjust it and how not just to dislike those things that you dislike but how to love those things which you dont dislike
3961578 burke brought home to me that our most necessary beliefs may be both unjustified and unjustifiable from our own perspective and that the attempt to justify them will lead merely to their loss replacing them with the abstract rational systems of the philosophers we may think ourselves more rational and better equipped for life in the modern world but in fact we are less well equipped and our new beliefs are far less justified for the very reason that they are justified by ourselves
3961579 im not saying that acceptance of the existing arrangements is the final arbiter of everything
3961580 youre arguing as though it ought to be easy to argue these things and it never is because after all one is talking not just about moral precepts to do with justice freedom and so on one is also talking about competing interests one of the great things about the conservative position in practical politics as opposed to theoretical philosophy is that it has always recognised that political solutions are compromises in which as many of the contending interests as possible are reconciled with each other so its essentially irenic philosophy its not to do with the righteous overbearing the unrighteous and imposing upon them a doctrine which they are rejecting or anything like that
3961581 in a case like the house of lords i think that obviously there would be the burkean arguments that if it aint broke dont fix it
3961582 then a conservative with my way of thinking would also recognise that in a democratic age people are filled with the idea that people who have gained power or authority without popular election are somehow illegitimately in that position even if you think thats wrong which i do youve got to say that nevertheless they represent a vast number in the population their interests and view of this must be entered into the equation and whichever compromise emerges would be the best that one could hope for that for me is what politics is that sort of decision making is totally unlike what socialists think politics is for them there are first principles from which you derive your procedures of action and then you proceed towards your goal and impose that goal on everybody regardless of whether they want it
3961583 sure some things would have been harder to bring about but some unwise changes would have been resisted look at the collapse of the education system if conservatives had entered more fully into the compromises which they didnt because the labour party was determined to exclude that voice then we wouldnt have i think the breakdown in school education which were witnessing today
3961584 i came from a background where culture wasnt very significant
3961585 you have to find some way of describing the benefits that my being cultured confers on those who arent and that is a hard task but not an impossible one its like asking what is the benefit for the mass of people of the priests vow of chastity theyre not going to vow chastity hes doing this by way of cementing his own personal relation with god but what is the benefit for others and we know that actually anthropologically there is a benefit there is somebody who deliberately absents himself from felicity in order to set an example to be immune to certain kinds of relationships to stand as father and advisor to a whole community i think that is the role that high culture has played in our society the theatre in particular but also concert gong and the rest a lot of people whom it has never directly touched it has indirectly touched by giving moral and spiritual sustenance to the teacher in the primary school for instance or to the person who is going to be prepared to set up a little youth orchestra in the village or an amateur theatrical group its preparing an elite for a sacrificial role which benefits others and thats the way i look at it
3961586 i get a tremendous benefit but also i lead a studious life and work extremely hard at getting the right word the right sentence and so on which i neednt bother with if i didnt have that sense that this is of intrinsic value and if i didnt do that but just wrote sloppily i wouldnt be able to propagate any message and maybe that would have negative impacts on others
3961587 culture is another name for the deepest examination of the human condition in a way
3961588 i take the view that this is one of the things religion does for people it is a channel through which that tradition of examination of the human condition can pass its wisdom down to ordinary people and illuminate their lives and i think the loss of religion makes it more obvious just what people lose through not having any culture as well the danger is that people will just get lost in a morass of addictive pleasures and not ask themselves the questions about the meaning of their own lives and not make the effort to make themselves interesting to others so that human relations begin to crumble i think were actually seeing that if you look round the society in which we are its not in a happy state although it has everything materially people are finding it very difficult to make themselves interesting to each other
3961589 there isnt any direct connection between high culture and morality at the level of the individual person thats why in the book
3961590 these are speculative connections and i may be wrong but one shouldnt be afraid of entertaining the thought that im right its not snobbery its like saying when christ said on the cross forgive them father for they know not what they do that wasnt snobbery but he was expressing a massively superior vision to those around him
3961591 its an interesting suggestion all we know from our predicament as modern westerners is that there has been this huge educational inheritance which were somewhat throwing away at the moment in which science mathematics literature music and fine art history and languages have all been mixed together and have fertilised each other we cant say that one bit of it could be extracted and survive without the rest but we can look at parts of the world that have had a high culture and lost it the middle east being a very obvious example and see how bereft it leaves people there isnt in the modern middle east and islam that ability to compromise to see the human condition in its totality to abstract from ones own immediate concerns that we have once of course all that high culture was there flourishing especially of course in persia in the 13th century
3961592 im not the first person to say this because plato in the
3961593 one answer is that the first thing it is making us do is to move in time to it and adapt our body rhythms and the emotional rhythms that go with it to what were listening to this is obviously a way of rehearing all kinds of things that we wouldnt normally rehearse because were too busy doing other things so it does matter what kind of music you listen to because it will implant its movements in your soul thats something that plato said in a completely different idiom but i think its true and of course the psychologists think this too because theyve done all this empirical research on what happens to children brought up listening to mozart as opposed to listening to pop music and all the rest so we know it has a hugely differential effect on their moral and intellectual development but i would say as adults there are great differences between those who enter into a state of frenzy through music and those who on the contrary enter a state of meditation these are character forming experiences
3961594 serious doubts arise as to whether the performers made more than a minimal contribution to the recording which owes its trade mark to subsequent sound engineering designed precisely to make it unrepeatable
3961595 i accept that i have actually been listening to quite a bit of heavy metal lately and metallica i think is genuinely talented master of puppets i think has got something genuinely both poetic violently poetic and musical every now and then something like that stands out and you can see that people have got no other repertoire and have a very narrow range of expression but theyve hit on something where they are saying something which is not just about themselves pop music is so concentrated on the self and the performer that its very rare that that happens i think it never happens with oasis or the verve it did happen much more of course with the beatles and in the old american songbook hoagy carmichael and cole porter and all that that was a popular music which was about communication of often quite gentle feelings so im not as prejudiced as i seem i would like to be more prejudiced because it would prevent me from listening to this stuff
3961596 well it is all below the belt with elvis i was slightly tongue in cheek
3961597 its true that people dont live up to my expectations this is one reason why we laugh laughter is in a great many cases a recognition of our falling short from an ideal if we didnt have ideals humour would all be black i still think that it would be a bad thing for mankind if people didnt make the effort that i and other people make to paint ideal portraits of the human condition
3961598 that is true in fairness to me it should be said that my writing however high toned it is is also quite humorous at times its more ironical than jokey i guess i certainly dont want to look as though im imposing some kind of solemn sermon but i only ever say what i think and perhaps what i think is a little bit too demanding
3961599 that passage was written slightly with tongue in cheek it was a chapter on why i became a conservative and was written with a sufficient irony to make the narrative plausible without in any way exaggerating the problems i had it is nevertheless the case that it was damn stupid to become a conservative had it not been for the fact that i was convinced of the truth of the position i would certainly have dropped it straight away because in the culture of those days remember this was the seventies it just isolated me from the university community and much of the way of life of people of my class interests and outlook so i was being a little ironical and looking at myself from the outside as a comic figure i didnt want to describe myself as a tragic figure
3961600 i was properly trained in cambridge and i would never want to dismiss the value of that training and the real achievements of people like wittgenstein obviously who is very much one of my culture heroes and the analytical method generally
3961601 but the problem is it does have a relentlessly negative effect because there is no attempt or very rarely is there an attempt to give a synthetic view of what the world is for us what the world is in itself and to fit the human being into this picture in its full complexity
3961602 you can make a contribution in analytical philosophy without making any connections with the broader culture the question that interests me though is whether you can use what you know from analytical philosophy to help understand the broader culture and i think you can thats what ive always tried to do certainly in my work in aesthetics my book on the philosophy of music is very analytical but is totally about the nature and meaning of the music and culture i think it benefits from being analytical i wouldnt ever want to repudiate that discipline
3961603 i made this site to share my thoughts tips and tools with fellow coldfusion developers
3961604 were not prepared to have things dictated to us everybody in the building ought to understand that
3961605 christianity thrives on human suffering and yearn for community it was precisely under these circumstances that i committed myself to christ at 19 years old when my family got into serious trouble father filed for bankruptcy my parents separated
3961606 the older i get and the more i study i find i believe less and less but that which i do believe i believe more and more
3961607 a guy ran into the front door and slapped them and then ran out

3961610 the reason why people leave the faith is because they were never truly called
3961611 donor transplant coordinators still seek the consent of the next of kin in practice we have not gone against the wishes of the donor family purely because of the fallout that may happen if we did in the uk the wishes of the living continue to override the wishes of the dead this obviously reduces the number of organs offered which results in the number of deaths on the transplant waiting lists

3961626 i reached out to old pal ric flair recently but hes been so busy that he hasnt gotten back to me i can only imagine how many people are trying to reach ric directly someone told me in norfolk that naitch changed his cell number yet again which would be about the second or third time for that process in the past few weeks naitch will call me without fail when i least expect it some of his 4 a m text messages are classic if i knew how to print them they would make a hilarious chapter in a book

3961772 with great reluctance and yet a sense of firm conviction
3961773 we have fully explored and exhausted every avenue for securing this funding in a manner that least affects californias budget and immediate cash needs
3961774 i think he has to be a part of the team and he cant be floating out there by himself because otherwise everyone would be out there trying to derail him
3961775 will continue to work cooperatively with the receiver and the legislature to move forward in a fiscally responsible way to provide the necessary funding for the receivers efforts
3961776 the idea of providing 8 billion for state of the art healthcare for murderers like charles ng richard allen davis and scott peterson is sheer lunacy
3961777 the federal courts have clearly indicated for 30 40 years that inmates have not lost the right to receive basic medical care
3961778 so there is a constitutional obligation here this is not something the state has a choice about
3961779 im very numb i just want some closure and i want the truth

3961798 discriminate against the exercise of the right in the regulation or provision of benefits facilities services or information
3961799 the claim that the bill would codify roe is just a marketing gimmick by the proponents
3961800 the sponsors hope that journalists and legislators will lazily accept that vague shorthand phrase but it is very misleading the references to roe in the bill are in non binding discursive clauses the heart of the bill is a ban that would nullify all of the major types of pro life laws that the supreme court has said are permissible under roe v wade including the ban on partial birth abortions and bans on government funding of abortion
3961801 the isi is cleverly fighting a proxy war in india that too with indian money bleeding our financial system while spilling blood on the streets
3961802 this money is used to finance terror related activities and make payments to cadres of terrorist organisations and underworld outfits close to the isi
3961803 the isi just has to bear the cost of printing fake notes
3961804 the entire terrorist network is sustained using genuine currency acquired from within india

3961821 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
3961822 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
3961823 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3961824 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3961825 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3961826 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales

3961830 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3961831 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3961832 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3961833 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3961834 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3961835 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3961836 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

3961844 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3961845 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
3961846 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

3961861 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
3961862 one family friend is outraged by both his behavior and his public apology the idea that so long as her cancer is in remission his cheating is somehow not so mind blowing
3961863 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3961864 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3961865 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

3961869 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3961870 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida

3961875 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3961876 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3961877 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3961878 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3961879 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3961880 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3961881 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3961882 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3961883 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3961884 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3961885 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3961886 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3961887 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3961888 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3961889 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3961890 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3961891 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3961892 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3961893 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3961894 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3961895 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3961896 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3961897 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3961898 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3961899 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3961900 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3961901 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3961902 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3961903 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3961904 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3961905 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3961906 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3961907 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3961908 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3961909 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3961910 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3961911 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3961912 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3961913 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3961914 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3961915 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3961916 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3961917 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3961918 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3961919 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3961920 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3961921 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3961922 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3961923 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3961924 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3961925 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3961926 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3961927 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3961928 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3961929 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3961930 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3961931 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3961932 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3961933 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3961934 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3961935 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3961936 yo a todo el mundo le digo que se meta en pol tica
3961937 yo a todos les digo metete en este curro y cuida tu bolsillo desde adentro nosotros tenemos el poder y nadie nos toca mas es culo
3961938 dime d nde nace la fantas a es en el coraz n o en la cabeza c mo empieza a alentar c mo se nutre cont stame cont stame
3961939 wont you let me take you on a ride in my range rover
3961940 you cant be serious my bentleys right outside and plus your breath smells like shit anyway
3961941 i need you oh gotta have you oh just wanna touch you oh i need your love yeah i need your love right now
3961942 we dont easily get the opportunity to thumb through the persons record collection a ringtone says as much about a person and its easier to get it across
3961943 if someone has downloaded a song by bob dylan or jimi hendrix to his cell phone this person is more than likely very pensive and interested in many different things
3961944 people tend to sort each other into categories and the question is in which one do we land
3961945 people who select a soft rock melody will surely be viewed by others as romantic
3961946 there are people who consider such a choice embarrassing or a bit cocked
3961947 the central question is does the ringtone suit me and the company
3961948 i am an absolute fan of the simpsons and for years have had the television comedy shows theme song on my cell phone
3961949 i have been approached in the underground after my cell phone rang and i have received shows of support when my phone rings while out in a pub
3961950 a person who downloads the star wars theme song is hoping it will help him reach others who share the same interest
3961951 this is the greatest day of my lift a dream has come true
3961952 i probably would have like to have gone a bit faster than that
3961953 there are not that many factors that can drive prices higher
3961954 the conflict in georgia does not have that much impact the pipeline was already offline
3961955 the olympic champion does have to prove that he is clean
3961956 it is a truly important time for us we have accepted that
3961957 i dont know if you have to dope for 9 6
3961958 treatment methods borrowed from medicine are taking hold in perfumeries
3961959 an ultrasound device whose waves penetrate deep enough to be effective would cost far too much
3961960 a rich cream then can be easily worked into the skin
3961961 such a treatment should be done only once every six weeks
3961962 if a microdermabrasion is to be really effective a lay person must be careful
3961963 in the worst case it can leave chemical burns on the skin
3961964 the skin of our test subjects looked exactly the same after a treatment as before
3961965 everything that the cosmetic industry offers in skin care products on the shelf is sufficient for taking care of normal skin
3961966 as soon as a consumer decides to enter the area of self diagnostics he should turn to a specialist for assistance
3961967 why not create a whole new kind of shoe which is fashionable smart for travelling and that fits into everybodys limited urban space
3961968 we redefined the old classic sneaker by using an international patented 2in1 zipper function
3961969 there is no appropriate public transport to get young people to places where other teenagers hang out like going to the cinemas or if they want to go to casuarina to hang out with their mates
3961970 we want to raise the profile so that they do get the resouces that they need the department has really been slimmed down in the research area for primary industries and fisheries
3961971 a lot of a major roads or lets call them the highways they are sort of getting to the end of their economical useful life and there is no priority as to which ones should get fixed
3961972 yet government is quite keen to promote kakadu as the region for tourism and all sorts of other things and yet getting to the region is obviously problematic
3961973 i dont think thats in the communitys best interest if someone like us does that certainly things that are in and around our resort we would assist in doing but thats why we all pay taxes
3961974 paul henderson will be a wonderful chief minister over time
3961975 hes actually a very warm and compassionate man and i dont think territorians saw that side of paul
3961976 some of that would have come i think if his leadership had been over a longer period before the election came
3961977 one of my interests is virtual reality and i want to heed the governments call for more serious involvement in the biomedical sector i feel engineers from various fields can contribute to biotechnology
3961978 unimaps dean of the school of engineering and the research unit the deputy vice chancellor of research and innovation and the vice chancellor himself have always supported my work this victory is as much theirs as it is mine
3961979 there were only 3 698 people undergoing dialysis in 1996 and now it has soared to 18 000
3961980 every year we set aside rm4 million to help the needy
3961981 kami sangat berduka cita atas berita bahwa bill gwatney telah meninggal
3961982 most certainly i want to dispose of this sham and i intend to do so
3961983 when i made those allegations i was in the national party and outside of it after that and i was making them with knowledge it never happened with my party
3961984 natural progress will mean there will be a robot able to climb inside the body and help the surgeon
3961985 it is happening in all forms of surgery its just so much more precise
3961986 its very expensive technology but the price will come down
3961987 this will be a domestic assistant robot and will interact in a close and personal way
3961988 on the podium i kept tearing thinking back at it im almost at a loss for words
3961989 from now on its just a downward slope phelps said
3961990 we talked about breaking seven minutes and we did it
3961991 my goggles pretty much filled up with water it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest
3961992 but its fine i wanted to break the record i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
3961993 oh my god i dont know how hes doing it i think about how he do this and set the world record
3961994 ive still got some left in the tank he said
3961995 its the funnest thing being part of a team being there in a team environment he said
3961996 its the best thing having four american guys to all go swim well together
3961997 it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what
3961998 of course of all things the number one thing that needs to work is the radio
3961999 at the time that my granddaughter was returned i was at the police sub station at 21st to place a missing persons report
3962000 he shouldnt have been on that bus with only his personal cell phone
3962001 there could have been a whole different other situations that came up
3962002 rowdy student student with a weapon theres tremendous things that could have transpired today
3962003 pihak pihak yang menyebarkan selebaran yang menyudutkan al manar itulah yang malah menyebarkan teror dan kegelisahan
3962004 tv ini ditonton 300 juta penduduk di dunia bahkan di amerika serikat
3962005 tayangan kami yang riil menunjukkan kesadisan dan kejahatan israel di palestina itulah yang membuat pihak pihak yang tidak suka menjadi berang
3962006 pada 23 april 2008 kedutaan amerika marah dan mengancam indosat bahkan ancamannya sampai menyinggung soal saham indosat di bursa new york
3962007 yang jadi pertanyaan saya kenapa indosat yang ditekan kenapa tidak langsung bikin surat ke saya atau al manar itu lebih ksatria

3962012 marcias pretty feisty this year only when its necessary does she really go for it but ive been going oooh marcia at times
3962013 ive seen her in action and i wouldnt like to be on the receiving end youve seen her go off at the boys dicko and kyle and ex judge mark holden before imagine her doing that to contestants
3962014 the last few years contestants have gone in knowing what to expect so they kind of play the game
3962015 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
3962016 those kids are half mine dammit and im going to have my share through the family court

3962018 i wonder if there will be a clamor to get them in a bcs game then
3962019 every former player of his that i ever talked to had the greatest praise for him because he cared for them both on and off the field i look back as a father now and he set an example of how to raise my children and im thankful for that
3962020 he was just absolutely committed to the development and to the betterment of our softball program
3962021 he was a tireless worker there was not a day that i drove by that field that he wasnt on the field coaching or working
3962022 jim never made it about him it was always about the kids having a good experience
3962023 he was a great mentor and he wanted what was best for his girls
3962024 skinny jeans have a snug fit through the legs and end in a small leg opening other names for this style include carrot leg pants cigarette pants drainpipes peg leg pants pencil pants skinny pants slimjims tapered pants old school hood jeans or ice cream cone pants
3962025 ive kind of given that up now and i just play along
3962026 its one of those dreams you have as a child in america
3962027 its the most amazing day of my life ive been working for this for the last eight years especially the last four and to time everything right on one day is an accomplishment of its own
3962028 lance lives a life im not at all familiar with
3962029 no movie stars or million dollar bank accounts for me
3962030 gold silver bronze it is all good it is a fantastic feeling
3962031 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3962032 russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3962033 actually sided with ordinary homeowners over a greedy local government and developer in their ruling the judges unanimously reversed a lower court decision giving
3962034 the mdc remains committed to participating in any meaningful and genuine dialogue that urgently moves this process forward
3962035 we are committed to a solution that recognizes that the people spoke on the 29th of march 2008 a solution that ensures tangible deliverables are put on the table of zimbabweans a solution must thus put the people first not leadership positions and titles
3962036 i would love to see more latinas i think they are coming weve got to be patient but soon they will be here
3962037 there are so many koreans but we have to follow their example because they are doing things very well
3962038 i want to thank everyone who has been so supportive
3962039 knowing my father he will be running circles around the rest of us in a matter of weeks
3962040 i have enclosed certified funds for each year that the homestead tax credit was applied covering the years of 2003 to 2008 as a total repayment of the tax credit
3962041 we got a container and chased it around the bottom of a crate for a while
3962042 what pleases me even more than the money is that this is effectively a public apology
3962043 a lot of wild figures have been bandied about but what i wanted more than money was for people in the street to realise they got it wrong about me
3962044 i would like to buy my council flat where ive lived for over 30 years and i want to put in a new bathroom and kitchen and make a few changes in the garden and of course make sure ive got food on my table and my bills paid
3962045 the best thing is being able to get off the dole im a proud man who has never been afraid of work but nobody in the countless interviews ive attended has wanted to take me on
3962046 im now slowly realising that i have a future after all and thats a great feeling
3962047 he never ends things with a clean slate he likes to dwell on these relationships and sort everything out before saying goodbye for good
3962048 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3962049 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
3962050 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3962051 she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
3962052 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
3962053 he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
3962054 those two games in particular show there is very very little between all three teams in the tri nations
3962055 if you are not 100 percent and get things dead right you will come second you just have to make sure you get your preparation right to play as well as you can
3962056 the win two weeks ago was satisfying but its easy to do one its about being able to back that performance up and thats what were trying to do
3962057 how a back rower operates comes off what happens in front of you
3962058 the last match was a great indicator of that the front five got stuck in and made our jobs a lot easier
3962059 he adds a lot of energy there and in the physical side of things he is always in amongst it
3962060 how effective you are depends on whether you get front foot ball or not i know certainly when you dont have front foot ball he can be a real menace
3962061 but for this all black team we want to make sure every time we go into a tri nations or any test we perform as well as we can and hopefully get the results were after
3962062 a vulnerability has been discovered in bittorrent which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a users system
3962063 is caused due to a boundary error in the processing of torrent files this can be exploited to cause a stack based buffer overflow by tricking the user into opening a torrent file containing an overly long created by field
3962064 if we think this is beautiful can you even begin to imagine what the
3962065 clark endorsed hillary clinton in the democratic primary and he has been so closely identified with the clintons that it would be hard for them to be anything less than fully supportive of the ticket if he were on it
3962066 everybody think about your daddy what does your daddy do at home
3962067 like every other creative endeavor at sojourn it was a big team effort
3962068 i think the idea for pastor daddy was daniel montgomerys
3962069 he wanted a book primarily for toddlers and pre schoolers that their parents could also learn from
3962070 jared wanted a set meter and rhyme scheme as i had done
3962071 but he preferred the way lindsey had grouped the thematic material and arranged the plot
3962072 i did write a worship song for sojournkids last year
3962073 but that was my only preparation i find it harder to write for children to make things simple but not simplistic
3962074 my primary experience comes as a result of teaching elementary students
3962075 she worked with me on writing things that wouldnt be too abstract or go over the kids heads
3962076 and we made various changes based on each others input
3962077 we all agreed that this would be the best style knowing the book was geared toward preschool age children
3962078 the reason this cadence works is that its so natural to roll off the tongue kids have an easier time memorizing it this way
3962079 i wrote the verses as if they were a hymn
3962080 so for instance you could sing pastor daddy to the tune amazing grace house of the rising sun and the gilligans island theme
3962081 teaching the christian doctrine of the home as a little church
3962082 because as with all of sojourns ministries the gospel is central to everything we do
3962083 our children should see that we never move beyond the gospel once we become christians
3962084 it becomes a daily part of our lives at church and at home
3962085 i cant draw at all so her talent is like magic to me
3962086 at this stage of their development children are constantly seeking information
3962087 they absorb everything they see and hear it seems that the childrens book industry mainly seeks to sell products however this book teaches basic truths i think the pictures allow children to connect the ideas with words
3962088 the verse was very simply written so i kept the illustrations simple as well
3962089 the gospel is a simple and clear message and pastor daddy helps connect the dots between the role of the gospel at church and at home it was very satisfying to illustrate
3962090 as i looked at the drawings i remember thinking these are perfect
3962091 i could immediately picture myself reading the book to my children
3962092 im kind of like gary sheffield i just sit around i dont do much and i collect a big check for my time
3962093 nonsense neither putin nor newly elected president dmitry medvedev have any such intention it is absurd to think that russia having extracted itself from two pointless wars in chechnya and afghanistan and after years of grinding poverty and social unrest following the fall of the soviet state would choose to wage an energy war with the nuclear armed us military that would be complete madness
3962094 the attack was unprovoked and took place a full 24 hours before even one russian soldier set foot in south ossetia
3962095 what happened on the night of august 7 is beyond comprehension
3962096 the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas
3962097 russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity
3962098 nevertheless it was still possible to find a political solution clearly the only way to solve the south ossetian problem on that basis is through peaceful means the georgian leadership flouted this key principle
3962099 the georgian government and its supporters should rethink their position
3962100 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
3962101 most certainly i want to dispose of this sham and i intend to do so
3962102 when i made those allegations i was in the national party and outside of it after that and i was making them with knowledge it never happened with my party

3962105 if you try to enforce a speed limit that seems unreasonable to a majority of drivers they tend to exceed it anyway
3962106 some people just dont get it and its too bad
3962107 because people should understand that by driving a little slower youre getting that better fuel economy
3962108 if were going to reduce our dependence on foreign oil weve got to consume less which were doing
3962109 i think we get a triple win if we do this
3962110 we reduce fuel consumption we save lives and we reduce co2 emissions

3962113 i fell short of all that i was called to do
3962114 by the grace of god i was able to finish my course but i still did not walk in all that i was called to do i fell short of the highest purposes that i could have walked in i had been given so much to understand and i walked in so little of it
3962115 i have fought the good fight i have finished the course i have kept the faith in the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge will award to me on that day
3962116 i was being honest when i wrote near the end of my life that i was the greatest of sinners i was not saying that i had been the greatest of sinners but that i was the greatest of sinners then
3962117 his jesus words are the foundation i have only built upon them by elaborating on his words the greatest wisdom and the most powerful truths are his words not mine
3962118 even in this conversation i can only confirm what i have already written but you still have much writing to do
3962119 because they did not have a love of the truth god gave them over to strong delusion that they might believe a lie
3962120 was this timeless or were you dealing with a specific situation
3962121 what really happened when you got out of prison the first time
3962122 christians will be assigned to various levels of heaven the christians who served the lord wholeheartedly and with the right motives will dwell in a level closer to christs throne and will enjoy more of his presence according to joyner
3962123 i believe that this was probably experienced by the apostles as they wrote the new testament epistles
3962124 the visions contained in this book all began with a dream some of it came under a very intense sense of the presence of the lord but the overwhelming majority was received in some level of a trance
3962125 i must state emphatically that i do not believe that any kind of prophetic revelation is for he purpose of establishing doctrine we have the scriptures for that
3962126 again if joyner truly believes that his vision is subject to error then he should be commended for this he should also be commended for teaching that the bible alone is error free but he contradicts these statements by claiming that the level of prophetic revelation recorded in his book is one of the highest and most accurate levels even higher and more accurate than new testament scripture so joyner seems to be talking out of both sides of his mouth
3962127 so joyner seems to be talking out of both sides of his mouth
3962128 it is time we repent quit supporting all these men and women who call themselves prophets and get back to our first love
3962129 either some editors at thomas nelson lack doctrinal discernment or they were willing to set it aside to make some bucks either way thomas nelson bears responsibility for promoting a book with such an unorthodox teaching
3962130 it is time we repent quit supporting all these men and women who call themselves prophets and get back to our first love
3962131 a false prophet as being under the influence of the devil what poppycock
3962132 we the dead saints joyner sees up there have our resurrected bodies now and you do not
3962133 do you have any ideas what else should i sell
3962134 in a civilized society abuse by those who are given great authority cannot be tolerated
3962135 we pray that it will not become a spectacle comparable to what took place in jena

3962137 its not just blacks being abused its whites being abused too

3962146 never more than a few days go by that i dont encounter third heaven and some kind of prophetic experience at times it happens daily for months supernatural experiences have become part of daily christianity for me
3962147 if such experiences should be a normal part of the christians life then many of us myself included are falling far short
3962148 is this is of man it will die out but if this is of god then you end up fighting god
3962149 hey everyone i am about to show you some false teaching
3962150 is this is of man it will die out but if this is of god then you end up fighting god

3962153 what a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god
3962154 for all have sinned all fall short of the glory of god
3962155 many of branhams critics believe he genuinely had a supernatural gift of healing but that it wasnt from god since he promoted heretical teachings
3962156 now we know that god heareth not sinners but if any man be a worshipper of god and doeth his will him he heareth since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind if this man were not of god he could do nothing
3962157 son of man i have made you a watchman for the house of israel therefore hear a word from my mouth and give them warning from me 18 when i say to the wicked you shall surely die and you give him no warning nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way to save his life that same wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood i will require at your hand
3962158 again when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity and i lay a stumbling block before him he shall die because you did not give him warning he shall die in his sin and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered but his blood i will require at your hand 21 nevertheless if you warn the righteous man that the righteous should not sin and he does not sin he shall surely live because he took warning also you will have delivered your soul
3962159 lord lord i cast out demons in your name i preached in your name i even raised the dead in your name
3962160 well gods been talking to me for a while and ive got a few things to tell you angela your spiritual gift is healing

3962163 for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strong holds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ

3962165 why sleep ye rise and pray lest ye enter into temptation
3962166 i am pretty sure that todd bentley does not share the teachings of mr branham but simply stating that the it was the same angel how fantastic that might sound it is a huge diference bentley does talk a lot about heaven and angels and we will all in due time share these experinces if we stays with the lord
3962167 you have heard that it was said to those of old you shall not commit adultery
3962168 but i say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart
3962169 but if that evil servant says in his heart my master is delaying his coming 24 49
3962170 the master of that servant will come on a day when he is not looking for him and at an hour that he is not aware of 24 51
3962171 not everyone who says to me lord lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he who does the will of my father in heaven
3962172 many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in your name cast out demons in your name and done many wonders in your name
3962173 and then i will declare to them i never knew you depart from me you who practice lawlessness
3962174 the son of man will send out his angels and they will gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and those who practice lawlessness

3962221 11it was he who gave some to be apostles some to be prophets some to be evangelists and some to be pastors and teachers 12to prepare gods people for works of service so that the body of christ may be built up 13until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the son of god and become mature attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of christ

3962237 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3962238 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3962239 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3962240 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3962241 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3962242 do not touch my anointed ones do my prophets no harm
3962243 now it is god who makes both us and you stand firm in christ he anointed us set his seal of ownership on us and put his spirit in our hearts as a deposit guaranteeing what is to come
3962244 but you have an anointing from the holy one and all of you know the truth as for you the anointing you received from him remains in you and you do not need anyone to teach you but as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real not counterfeit just as it has taught you remain in him
3962245 someone like you comes along and says to calm down
3962246 someone like you comes along and says to calm down
3962247 that if anyone preaches a different gospel let them be accursed or damned
3962248 for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into apostles of christ
3962249 whose end is destruction and whose god is thier belly and whose glory is thier shame they set thier mind on earthly things
3962250 now the spirit the holy spirit expressly says some will depart from the faith giving heed to doctrines of demons any other doctrine that is not of the bible
3962251 for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine the bible but according to thier own desires because they have itching ears they will heap up for themselves teachers verse 4 and they will turn their ears away from the truth and aside to fables

3962260 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3962261 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3962262 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3962263 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3962264 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3962265 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3962266 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3962408 about the rocket firing i think those who are responsible are those who collaborate with israel because there is a consensus by all palestinian groups to respect the truce
3962409 linked to israel as they provide a pretext to exercise pressure on the palestinian people

3962414 center of world power extending from germany and poland in the east through russia and china to the pacific and including the middle east and the indian subcontinent
3962415 the most immediate us task is to make certain that no state or combination of states gains the capacity to expel the united states from eurasia or even to diminish significantly its decisive arbitration role
3962416 if you dont pay attention and dont get involved it will be your own backyard your own child being affected
3962417 we support this proposed change but without the funding that should accompany it im not sure how we could accomplish it
3962418 but they kept telling us there was nothing wrong with the schools
3962419 there may be times we dont know somethings going on or we dont recognize the risk until later
3962420 if changes need to be made the door has not been slammed shut as it has been for the last 40 years
3962421 para electrificar las veredas sic el teba y los zambos
3962422 con regal as asegur se han construido museos empresas industriales estadios y se han pagado gastos de funcionamiento de las entidades territoriales
3962423 ejemplos de este despilfarro son el museo del hombre llanero procesadoras de yuca y un patin dromo en casanare un vel dromo en arauca una planta de asfalto y el puente sobre el r o mulato en putumayo
3962424 por el lado de las importaciones se deja de movilizar un promedio de 57
3962425 en la medida en que el puerto sigue recibiendo mercanc a del exterior las condiciones se vuelven m s cr ticas
3962426 el gobierno hizo grandes concesiones al transporte de carga al aceptar la existencia de una tabla de fletes obligatoria pero es preciso que el pa s tome conciencia sobre los costos y riesgos que acarrea el sostenimiento de esquemas artificiales de formaci n de precios
3962427 en los ltimos a os ha sido importante el crecimiento en la colocaci n de m quinas para espresso porque crecen los actores que ofrecen caf y que abren m s locales
3962428 para nosotros ha sido importante este proveedor para entrenar al personal interno en el mantenimiento preventivo y operativo de las m quinas permitiendo ahorrar costos
3962429 lo m s alta posible considerando los riesgos de impacto en el contrabando
3962430 es como si una empresa de 11 mil trabajadores suspendiera operaciones durante todo un a o
3962431 si bien podemos dar un balance positivo en cuanto a la disminuci n de accidentes no hay que olvidar que cualquier accidente puede ser grave y genera un costo social y humano muy alto
3962432 con esta misi n trabajamos en la estrategia de diversificaci n de mercados con plazas de alto potencial para el sector como m xico chile y toda la regi n caribe
3962433 en particular la anh se dio cuenta de que colombia no era el para so petrolero que muchos imaginaron y procedi entonces a graduar la participaci n financiera del estado colombiano reduciendo el llamado government take de los ilusos niveles del 70 80 por ciento a algo m s razonable en la franja 50 60 por ciento dependiendo de m ltiples factores
3962434 es probable que esa din mica no dure mucho tiempo porque no se han encontrado yacimientos nuevos y en algunos casos los costos para producir son demasiado altos aunque con los actuales precios internacionales del petr leo dan para realizar m s operaciones de explotaci n
3962435 los resultados han sido casi nulos pues ya llevamos casi cuatro a os y los yacimientos descubiertos son de muy baja reserva por eso se debe explorar en otras zonas diferentes a las actuales por ejemplo m s en el rea del meta
3962436 esperamos que los resultados se den en materia de exploraci n pero hasta ahora lo m s positivo que tenemos son los altos precios del petr leo que permiten sacar crudo de cualquier yacimiento por m s costoso que resulte
3962437 anteriormente cualquier compa a que quisiera entrar a explorar en colombia deb a hacerlo como socia de ecopetrol pero eso ya cambi y ahora se observa un fuerte inter s de los petroleros extranjeros por entrar al pa s ese esquema puso a ecopetrol a ser m s competitiva que tomara una din mica mucho m s ofensiva porque convirti a la compa a en un jugador m s en el mercado

3962443 the club will not do anything crazy or break our financial and sporting guidelines so we have gone as far as we have been able to there is complete agreement between the club and the player david silva that he will remain with us for the next five seasons we have always expressed the hope that he will stay with us
3962444 if villa or silva leave then it would be really bad
3962445 i am counting on them for this season and we are doing everything possible to ensure that they stay with us and that the fans can see them play every week the club is going to try and keep them with us for as long as they can
3962446 one cannot believe the amount of news and stories written about this during pre season but we have had to learn to live with it because valencia is a great club

3962476 in practice there is no single formula or standard definition of mixed income housing
3962477 communities and developers around the county must evaluate local market conditions and develop locally supported concepts and characteristics of the mixed income development
3962478 low income households may occupy from 20 percent to more than 60 percent of the mixed income units
3962479 the most affluent households in a mixed income project may have incomes as low as 51 percent of the area median income or as high as 200 percent
3962480 most housing professionals agree that concentrating assisted housing for low and very low income americans in dense urban areas is not an effective use of scarce affordable housing resources
3962481 over the past decade professionals in the affordable housing industry have turned increasingly to mixed income housing as an alternative to traditional assisted housing initiatives
3962482 mixed income housing developments help raise the standards for good design in affordable housing providing appealing residences that blend in with surrounding communities

3962494 when we first started the schools told us we couldnt do the festival because there were gang rivalries between the two schools on one side of division and the one on the other side of division

3962496 the good news is well get him back at some point during the season

3962499 he had injured his back approximately three years ago he missed two or three days of practice he had no symptoms of any kind of herniation when that injury occurred he had no missed time in the last three years so its a new injury
3962500 we have a few guys out you would like to have everyone out there working but it never works that way in training camp you just have to realize thats a part of it eventually well get our players back and we cant wait

3962530 i really think it boils down to this decision this choice that you will succeed and you will be resilient and you will fight on and use all of those tools and succeed at life
3962531 part of the problem with our society is we condone the victim stance its easier to be a victim and be supported in a way to decide not to do that takes a lot more strength and its so much more worth it
3962532 when i was going about this process of healing people were asking me how i was doing it and how i was okay
3962533 the human spirit is incredible and we need to nurture that spirit and allow it to grow and be okay again
3962534 the huge variety of issues that people are dealing with in their lives is humbling
3962535 part of what i enjoy about my work is the people that come to me are already on the pat of healing theyve made the decision people are realising that you dont just get handed all of the answers on a plate you do need to show initiative
3962536 id love to win but most of all i want to go to sleep each night feeling good about the next day and what im doing
3962537 i want the process to make me feel really comfortable with modelling and im willing to let it lead me where im meant to go

3962543 im so busy with my studies that my social life revolves around work i love meeting new people and a coffee shop is one of the perfect places to do that its also one of the reasons i entered the showgirl competition

3962545 i often go to the track and help him in the mornings but i especially love helping on race days
3962546 theres nothing like the thrill of seeing one of your horses come across the line first
3962547 it offers a good opportunity for us as young women in the hawkesbury to get involved in our local show
3962548 ive always gone to the show since i was young so itd be really exciting to see it from a different angle and meet new people
3962549 i think entering the showgirl competition is something all girls should do not only for the community but for their own self development as well especially when you consider the interview stage is very similar to job interview so its great practice
3962550 the presentation of a city is closely tied to how residents care for their homes and gardens and how businesses and institutions keep the areas surrounding their facilities the hawkesbury garden competition is designed to encourage and recognise pride in the hawkesbury community
3962551 we cannot neglect this river like it has been for the past 50 years it cant sustain this neglect

3962554 it takes a lot of time and you must look at all issues from both sides of the fence thats been my philosophy

3962601 well anybodys guess yan puwedeng mangyari pwede ring di mangyari volatile kasi ang market
3962602 kung bumaba sa world market halimbawa isang transaksyon di ibig sabihin yon na rin ang aktwal na nabibili natin yon ay for delivery pa sa september kaya minsan nagkakaroon ng misconception na bakit di naro rollback agad ay dahil yon naman ay darating pa mga 15 30 days pa yon at ang gingamit namin ngayon ay yong naangkat na dumating pa noong hulyo
3962603 ngayon pa lang kaya nagsimula nang mag discount na two weeks ago pa ay inaanticipate namin ang mababa in effect sakripisyo na rin yon pero gusto rin natin ay bumalik ang mga motorista sa kalsada ang mga motorista talagang bumaba yong demand napansin naming noong tumataas one way of encouraging demand para lahat ng motorista muling timangkilik sa paggamit ng langis at gaolina

3962669 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer
3962670 i dont see there is anything wrong with it if everybody concerned agrees
3962671 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
3962672 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
3962673 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
3962674 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live
3962675 this girl has a great voice and they should recognize that she deserves to be seen she should definitely perform at the closing ceremonies
3962676 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
3962677 the right information has to be given to the people
3962678 russias ongoing action raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3962679 will personally convey americas unwavering support for georgias democratic government on this trip she will continue our efforts to rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
3962680 in the days ahead we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
3962681 we fully expect russia to keep its word to provide free access to humanitarian assistance and allow any of our assistance to arrive either by military or commercial means by air land and sea
3962682 when the company shows interest in employee development the employee naturally has a greater interest in the companys development too
3962683 businesses have begun to realize the importance and the benefits of employee training and development when employees are trained properly and assessed periodically a business definitely improves
3962684 when you hear a positive remark about an individual repeat it to that person as soon as possible seek the person out if necessary if you cant meet leave an electronic mail or voice mail message
3962685 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
3962686 joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
3962687 ieh volgens mij zit daar een muis met de m amp m te spelen
3962688 oh um ok then just bring them in on thursday
3962689 everyone talking crap on alicia sacramone needs to just be quiet

3962691 have you lost your damn mind myspace is a great way to promote your group how in the hell do you guys expect to draw anyone to your shows
3962692 for fucks sake we get it please shut the fuck up already
3962693 everything was normal i was looking at a little girl buying bread from an old vendor and suddenly everything blew up and it got crazy
3962694 the president is being warned that some issues are a red line that shouldnt be crossed
3962695 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step
3962696 the terrorist act will not block the launch of our new government
3962697 the violence could be different in form but its aim is the same keeping a state of chaos in the city
3962698 being a state senator where i have a forum to criticize him
3962699 when youre down there at the capitol every day and youre frustrated sure you think about it
3962700 now im home with my wife and kids and my frustration level isnt pegging out at 110 percent
3962701 he did real well he was able to put a different hat on
3962702 senseless act of depraved violence that touches all of us
3962703 he was a very effective leader for his party and an event like this certainly makes all politics seem small and insignificant
3962704 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
3962705 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney along with thousands of other arkansans ginger and i are trying to come to terms with such a shocking and senseless attack
3962706 acquiring mo strengthens our nucleus of players for both the short and long term
3962707 he is entering his prime nba years and will be part of the foundation of our future success
3962708 mo is a player that excels as a traditional point guard but also brings an extra dimension with his scoring and versatility
3962709 as always he is holding his cards close and waiting for more information
3962710 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
3962711 i am not going to the convention i have made this clear
3962712 i have voted for members of both parties in the course of my adult life and as i said earlier i will vote for the candidate i think can do the best job for america whether that candidate is a republican a democrat or an independent
3962713 he has energized a lot of people around the world and so i think he is worth listening to and seeing what he stands for
3962714 he likes and admires john mccain and that would be a factor in anything he does if he decides to get more involved
3962715 and likes him and is looking for a reason to vote for him he hasnt found it yet
3962716 i will ultimately vote for the person i believe brings to the american people the kind of vision the american people want to see for the next four years
3962717 a vision that reaches out to the rest of the world that starts to restore confidence in america that starts to restore favorable ratings to america frankly weve lost a lot in recent years
3962718 signal that choice sends about the character and judgment of the candidate
3962719 it was wonderful enough to do it in the 100
3962720 if i could do it in the 200 it would be a dream come true but if i cant it will in no way be a blemish on my career
3962721 it felt great i didnt even know i had broken an olympic record
3962722 it reminded me that i am in the right place and not to stress
3962723 we swam together a little bit and i got to know her she is a great girl
3962724 luckily i was next to the world record holder in the preliminary judging off her i think i did pretty good
3962725 to think that time won it all in sydney but thats what it will take just to get to the final here hopefully im making the finals this time
3962726 they were ambushed and murdered at 10 30 in the morning by numerous armed gunmen and it was very very fast
3962727 they were absolutely committed passionate caring and highly effective workers and they were purely on a humanitarian mission
3962728 people only travel in broad daylight in small groups we equip them with extensive communication radio equipment so they can call ahead
3962729 hey johnny check your schedule theres been a change for tonight

3962734 yes sir johnny mr waters i was just trying to make a call i didnt realize you were talking
3962735 i dont give a rats ass what you were doing just get off the phone and leave us alone
3962736 no but i bet you havent heard the latest bout johnny
3962737 after last year after what happened to mrs hepplemans prize calf theres no way that stuey would ever invite him back
3962738 not only has stuey mr stuart invited him back but hes threatening to ruin him if he doesnt show up
3962739 im going to spread this to everyone but dont worry ill give you credit
3962740 get in here i need you to do a letter for me
3962741 forget about the letter i have another project for you
3962742 i want you to find out whos spreading rumors about me
3962743 in a distorted and misleading way to sell its issue to public investors
3962744 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
3962745 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
3962746 across studies prior mental health emerged as the strongest predictor of post abortion mental health many of these same factors also predict negative psychological reactions to other types of stressful life events including childbirth
3962747 i think everything just got the best of my head i got nerves on the beam and i carried it to the floor too
3962748 they look pretty young but i don t look 20 so im not one to judge
3962749 its a slap in the face in front of the world
3962750 well i have no proof certainly so much talk about that which possibly could be because one of the girls has a missing tooth if it is true it is totally unfair certain countries go by rules and certain countries do not
3962751 my real age is 16 i dont care about what other people say
3962752 tell me what country in the world has the medals that our lineup has
3962753 youre talking about world champions who have been there and done that
3962754 not enough of us drive to you know to take other people
3962755 we might not be able to take our clients out we will be trapped here mercy hospital it decreases what we can do and its needless to have this kind of destruction
3962756 it just didnt work out this year but the guys in detroit treated me great
3962757 im looking forward to going to clemson and hopefully in three years detroit picks me again
3962758 i cant wait to get down there and get to work and hopefully i can contribute for them one day in the big leagues
3962759 we were teaching the children conflict resolution without resorting to violence
3962760 we taught only in english at the school and families were amazed at how fast their children were learning
3962761 so far the community is refusing to send their kids to the hamas kindergarten
3962762 hamas said they were going to cut me to pieces on their website
3962763 god was blinding their eyes all the time we were there
3962764 although the call that sunday morning was a tough one to take we know that it was no surprise to god
3962765 dear friends dont be surprised at the fiery trials you are going through as if something strange were happening to you instead be very glad for these trials make you partners with christ in his suffering so that you will have the wonderful joy of seeing his glory when it is revealed to all the world
3962766 we know that the joy and hope that we have is unfailing because we have the knowledge of the giver of that hope
3962767 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
3962768 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
3962769 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
3962770 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
3962771 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
3962772 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
3962773 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem
3962774 t his interview will open many peoples eyes it will shake islam from the roots and im not exaggerating
3962775 what other case do you know where a son of a hamas leader who was raised on the tenets of extremist islam comes out against it
3962776 a verse like love thine enemy had a great influence on me
3962777 at this stage i was still a muslim and i thought that i would remain one but every day i saw the terrible things done in the name of religion by those who considered themselves great believers
3962778 i studied islam more thoroughly and found no answers there i re examined the koran and the principals of the faith and found how it is mistaken and misleading
3962779 the people who supposedly represent the religion admired mohammed more than god killed innocent people in the name of islam beat their wives and dont have any idea what god is
3962780 i have no doubt that theyll go to hell i have a message for them there is only one way to paradise the way of jesus who sacrificed himself on the cross for all of us
3962781 i felt responsible it was better for me to be there rather than a gang of fools who would poison his mind
3962782 i tried to understand those people their thoughts in order to change them from inside by means of a strong person like my father who admitted to me in the past that he does not support suicide attacks
3962783 yousef described his father as a moderate hamas leader but even before his encounter with christianity yousef had already become disenchanted with hamas and islam after being imprisoned at the age of 18 years old for heading a youth islamic movement at his high school
3962784 nobody knows them and how they operate as well as i do
3962785 then in prison i understood that not everyone in hamas is like my father hes a nice friendly man but i discovered how evil his colleagues are
3962786 after my release i lost the faith i had in those who ostensibly represented islam
3962787 now yousef the eldest son of sheikh yousef says he admires israel
3962788 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas
3962789 islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death
3962790 in palestinian culture a suicide terrorist becomes a hero a martyr sheiks tell their students about the heroism of the shaheeds martyr
3962791 they hamas are blind and ignorant its true there are good and bad people everywhere but hamas supporters dont understand that they are led by a wicked and cruel group that brainwashes the children and gets them to believe that if they carry out a suicide attack theyll get to paradise
3962792 the muslim turned christian says he does not think islam will survive for more than 25 years because the truth about islam will be exposed given the mass communication available in the modern age
3962793 take them out of the darkness and the prison of islam
3962794 in that way theyll have an opportunity to correct their mistakes to become better people and to bring a chance for peace in the middle east
3962795 but at the moment at least my ambitions are only to find work a place to live
3962796 i was about to become one of those homeless people in the united states
3962797 but people from the church are helping me im dependent on them
3962798 i know that im endangering my life and am even liable to lose my father but i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity
3962799 maybe one day ill be able to return to palestine and to ramallah with jesus in the kingdom of god
3962800 hey im selfish im guilty but you should ignore how i live and forgive me because thats just how things are
3962801 the father buys the son builds the grandchild sells and his son begs
3962802 most family business owners do have basic succession trust and estate plans however too often they are sitting on shelves gathering dust not only do these families need to act on implementing and updating their wealth planning strategies they need more sophisticated strategies to better protect their wealth
3962803 grandma gave it to me years ago i just left it in her house until she died
3962804 in july 2002 the trustees of the milton hershey school trust announced a plan to diversify the trusts investment portfolio by selling the trusts controlling interest in the hershey company
3962805 regarding trust law our findings imply agency costs arising from the trusts charitable trust form on the order of 850 million about 15 of the 2002 value of the trust although the trustees controlled more than three quarters of the shareholder votes in the company they failed to impose a value maximizing strategy on the companys managers as we have seen the market judged the company as being 2 7 billion or 25 5 more valuable when the companys managers were expected to be subject to the market for corporate control instead of supervision by the trustees moreover instead of reducing the agency costs associated with the trusts charitable trust form the attorney generals intervention made those agency costs permanent without any offsetting financial benefit to the trust the attorney general forced the trust to retain an asset that was worth 850 million more on the open market than in the hands of the trustees while the sales detractors argued that the sale would hurt other stakeholders such as the residents of hershey and the companys employees one wonders whether their gain offsets the preservation of such enormous agency costs the 850 million in trust assets destroyed translates roughly into 67 000 per resident of hershey or 62 000 per employee of the company plus the trusts exposure to uncompensated risk was continued
3962806 jeff was so convincing that i knew we had to go
3962807 yuschenko and the other mothers wanted to minister to their children to take care of them to find the resources they needed and to have a place to meet and care for the special needs of their handicapped children
3962808 when i first met lena several years ago and found out about her desire to care for the handicapped children here in konotop i was sure that we would be able to help them to buy a little building in konotop which is where the hearts of love center is now located
3962809 sponsors have been attracted by eeo to help establish and maintain the center
3962810 many families in this area of ukraine have children who have handicaps eeos goal as a mission organization is to partner with people churches and other organizations to help these children and their families
3962811 were excited about whats happening here the people are helping themselves
3962812 our job is to compliment what the local people are doing and get this konotop hearts of love center finished the kids deserve it the parents need it and the good news is that theyre being saved theyre being brought to good health
3962813 we can resource them with not only a place to come to but also with the physical equipment physical education and by working with them physically as well as spiritually and emotionally
3962814 the russians just shot down the government command nets so they could cover their incursion
3962815 this was really one of the first aspects of a coordinated military action that had cyber as a lead force instead of sending in air planes we need to figure out a way not only see the attack coming but to block it and in blocking it chase it home
3962816 i think this is a very poor time to send a signal that the united states is not interested in focusing on warfighting in the cyber domain
3962817 advising a child that he or she will not receive an equal share may have adverse effects even if it prevents litigation after death
3962818 it will be within range of what we can handle
3962819 browsing a partys web site will only show the information that the web site owner currently wants visitors to see
3962820 while some choose to contribute to broad public goals the law does not require it in recent years charitable status has been recognized for organizations with purposes as idiosyncratic as promoting excellence in quilting and educating the public about huey military aircraft
3962821 in mrs helmsleys case given that her fortune warranted an estate tax rate of 45 percent her 8 billion donation for dogs is really a gift of 4 4 billion from her and 3 6 billion from you and me to put it in perspective our contribution to mrs helmsleys cause equals approximately half of what we spend on head start a program that benefits 900 000 children
3962822 the howard government ruthlessly exploited mandatory detention as a critical component in its campaign to secure political advantage by exploiting anti immigrant sentiment its efforts to exploit and demonise asylum seekers legitimate and otherwise were unremitting in doing so it locked up children who suffered serious psychological injury from the process of incarceration
3962823 hes whiny hes sneaky hes smirky hes got no balls hes got no ticker
3962824 the abc has as much right as any other media organisation to defend its copyright and ive no doubt crikey would do the same in a similar situation being the national broadcaster doesnt mean the abc should have to surrender its copyright so that another party this time crikey can show abc footage without paying usage fees
3962825 yesterday item 21 i have recently bought an apartment in glen iris a relatively inner city suburb of melbourne optus were unable to provide me with a fixed line home phone adsl or cable internet nor foxtel hd i work with someone who lives in the same block who does have optus fixed line home phone and adsl connected i queried optus on three separate occasions and never received a full answer but the most plausible was that they were unable to get new lines from the telstra controlled exchanges so i am now the proud new owner of a telstra home phone line a bigpond cable internet connection and foxtel hd why because i had no choice i have been an optus mobile phone customer for 11 years and been reasonably happy if only telstra now offered me a decent incentive to change that also i probably would but having just signed a new 24 month contract with optus for an iphone it wont be soon five million customers migrating sol should not be too hard if my experience is anything to go by corruption autocracy and democracy again again
3962826 attempts to interpret power of attorney documents in such limited ways have been litigated repeatedly with the superior court applying very limited interpretations of documents and the supreme court confirming time and time again that power of attorney documents must be interpreted broadly kudos to the supreme court for grasping the implications of this issue as it effects all of those and there are many who act under these power of attorney documents
3962827 w e hold the power of attorney at issue was sufficient to empower the agent to change the beneficiary of the life insurance policy
3962828 muito bom trazer de volta uma medalha para o brasil na nata o depois do gustavo borges e do fernando scherer principalmente nessa prova
3962829 the lawyers task when considering the legal standard of competency is to be able effectively to distinguish foolish socially deviant risky or simply

3962841 i didnt want to have to tell you this but youve left me no choice i lied to you on the phone antanas and i dated in high school but eventually broke up some years later we got back together but unbeknownst to me he was married to you he was planning on leaving you until you got pregnant he didnt want to be one of those men that run as soon as they find out they are going to be a father he was too much of a coward to tell me the truth so one day he just left i never saw or heard from him again until yesterday when we met in a caf we got to talking and he explained everything to me i guess i was asking too many questions cause he got angry and stormed out of the building i was on my way home when i saw an accident happen i went to help the person when i realized it was antanas i called an ambulance but they were taking too long because of the storm so i took him back to my place i know that was unprofessional me being an r n i know youre never supposed to move someone who may have a head injury but i wasnt thinking he came around a few hours later i called an ambulance again but they still were taking too long so i attempted to drive him there myself but was forced to go back because of the storm he had clearly had amnesia caused from an obvious head injury i called for an ambulance several more times but it was a waste of time i drove him here myself he was convulsing in my car and i was so scared im sorry you had to find out this way but i doubt antanas would ever be able to tell you
3962842 die deutsche bank hat ihre kunden falsch beraten und so getan als seien ars wie bargeld
3962843 das finanzsystem ist in den vergangenen zw lf monaten durch einen stresstest gelaufen den wir in dieser form nicht erwartet haben die turbulenzen dauern l nger an und betreffen inzwischen mehr segmente des finanzmarktes als wir vorher angenommen hatten
3962844 es besteht der verdacht dass die ehemaligen vorst nde die existenz der bank aufs spiel setzten
3962845 hes the dead horse is in his late 20s and thats pretty old for a horse he had numerous problems like liver disease and cancer
3962846 these are problems hes had for five years losing him was very emotional the other two horses are young thoroughbreds and are naturally thin
3962847 the thing i do in life is save animals these allegations are crazy
3962848 its a retirement place for old horses they let them roam and put them in a pasture and feed them and take care of them
3962849 id hate to see them bring animal cruelty charges against her because they died of old age
3962850 they have to get it in the ground or itll start sinking and i just dont know what theyll do with this one
3962851 i am making wooden bowls and spoons for you so that when you are old you can eat in the kitchen just like grandpa
3962852 t he father and grandfather and the mother and grandmother and the children of every poor old blind lame and incompetent person or other poor person not able to work being of a sufficient ability shall at their own charges relieve and maintain every such poor person
3962853 all of the following individuals have the responsibility to care for and maintain or financially assist an indigent person i the spouse of the indigent person ii the child of the indigent person iii the parent of the indigent person
3962854 the moral duty receded as society evolved family life changed and government created a variety of federal and state programs to meet the needs of the poor
3962855 definitely a huge mistake i made four years ago by taking the prelims too lightly it has been eating at me for a long time and for me to go out there and accomplish that medal i am really excited
3962856 it felt comfortable so hopefully i can be good for tomorrow and bring something else out
3962857 we can expect challenges to testamentary capacity to increase during the coming decades as the number of older adults increases
3962858 the assessment of testamentary capacity and its interrelationship with vulnerability to undue influence bring together the medical and legal domains
3962859 what does he have clones is he budding asexually reproducing what cause i really wanna know more michael phelps in the world is a good thing
3962860 my apology to ralph nader for not demanding that he be included in the debates
3962861 he has not shown that the u s has either as a matter of deliberate policy or official indiffernce required or allowed its combatants to engage in widespread actions in violation of humanitarian law
3962862 no matter how much i wanted to i could not convince myself that killing someone was right
3962863 i have already missed a large chunk of my young sons life and i was willing to sacrifice any more lost time with him especially during his formative years
3962864 because it is an act of aggression with no defensive basis it has been supported by pretenses that cannot withstand even elementary scrutiny first before the u s dropped the first bomb it was quite evident that iraq had no weapons of mass destruction second the bush administration had the gall to exploit the american publics fear of terrorists by making the absurd assertion that a secular batthist government was working with a fundamentalist terrorist group there was nevery any intelligence to substantiate this third the notion that the u s wants to export democracy to iraq is laughable democracy is by the people not an appointed puppet theater
3962865 a u s soldier who deserted his iraq bound regiment and sought asylum in canada said the u s war in iraq was illegal and he accused the united states of committing war crimes pfc jeremy hinzman 25 is believed to be the first u s soldier to apply for refugee status in canada after refusing combat duty in iraq
3962866 i was told in basic training that if im given an illegal or immoral order it is my duty to disobey it
3962867 whether a country lives under freedom or tyranny or whatever else thats the collective responsibility of the people of that country
3962868 this is a very disappointing decision it puts canada more fully in complicity with an illegal and immoral war jeremy will probably end up back here at fort bragg thats usually what happens
3962869 i applied for conscientious objector status in the u s army because i realized that i cannot kill a fellow humna being but my application was denied i knew that in iraq i would be ordered to take part in combat operations or other actions that are against my principles
3962870 nga and i knew canada had welcomed many americans like us during the vietnam war and we knew canada had refused to join the invasion of iraq
3962871 sending jeremy and his family back to the u s where he would face harsh punishment would be cruel
3962872 it would fly in the face of the motion adopted by the house of commons on june 3 which called on the harper government to stop all deportation proceedings against these conscientious objectors
3962873 jeremy hinzman 29 had filed for a pre removal risk assessment and permanent residency on humanitarian and compassionate grounds with citizenship and immigration canada in january after several prior failed attempts to gain refugee status today he was told that both of those applications had been rejected and he must leave the country by sept 23
3962874 obviously were disappointed but life goes on and well make the most of it wherever we end up
3962875 im disappointed but i think that every soldier that has refused to fight in iraq has done a good thing and im not ashamed
3962876 robidoux said hinzman who lives in toronto with his wife and two children plans to take a close look at the decisions before deciding how to proceed

3962885 at the end of july european countries decided to halt the processing of accepting new refugees and to postpone until september discussions about those who submitted their requests for refugee status the decision does not stem only from concern over the growth in the number of iraqis in europe and an increase in the muslim element on the continent but primarily against the backdrop of iraqi preime minister nuri request to stop absorbing refugees al maliki explained to european heads of state and interior ministers he met with that the situation in iraq has improved and iraq needs its refugees in order to rebuild the state

3962946 people need to be waking up to the realities of the world and that the days of easy money have come to a pretty sudden end
3962947 there is an awful lot of talk about big transfers and major demands of players but you will find throughout the uk and europe that money is not quite as easy to obtain as it used to be
3962948 were expecting the levels of transfer fees this summer to still to be quite high but probably not as high as the record that was set last summer
3962949 euro 2008 happened towards the start of the summer transfer window
3962950 the level of transfer activity at the start of a window sometimes decreases when there is a major tournament taking place
3962951 another factor is that the 2008 09 season is the second year of a three year broadcast deal and the level of broadcasting revenues to clubs this year will be broadly similar to what they received last year
3962952 so were not seeing a step change in the amount of revenues that clubs are getting year on year
3962953 another point is weve not seen anything like the number of changes in club ownership in the last 12 months compared to the previous 12 months premier league clubs for whom this window is their first opportunity to buy and sell players so i think thats another factor
3962954 who am i gonna make cry every day and then cheer up every day
3962955 dass die fahrradboxen aber nun im messepark stehen ohne dass in der innenstadt f r ersatz gesorgt wurde ist nicht mehr nachvollziehbar

3962957 on day one i downloaded and installed silverlight and then was told that i couldnt view any content because i watch tv using an antenna the message said that i had to use a cable or satellite partner of nbc if i wanted to watch a video stream on the internet
3962958 last i checked no one is forcing you to use linux or old mac versions stop bitching for the choice you made
3962959 supporting linux means hiring more people which means more money spent
3962960 doesnt support because less than 01 of all computer users have their main os as linux
3962961 i think weve got some guys that have some tweaks about them and theyre not practicing

3962965 openoffice can successfully substitute proprietary applications and will result in significant savings on licenses
3962966 during these meetings our volunteers presented open source applications answered questions and cleared up doubts they often also helped in installing the software on the pcs in school computer labs and on school servers
3962967 we combined our visit to the city with the free software day which attracted local open source developers and we even managed to interest university teachers and several local police officers
3962968 some school staff told us they are still considering a switch others would use the summer vacation to for instance install openoffice and a few schools said they would switch to open source when they renew their computer labs
3962969 at this school teachers show students how to use microsoft windows gnu linux and mac os x this broad knowledge base lets students develop their interests without limiting them to a specific platform
3962970 im still not convinced that he actually was born a natural born citizen
3962971 it can no longer be assumed that welfare is greater at an all around higher level of production than at a lower one the higher level of production has merely a higher level of want creation necessitating a higher level of want satisfaction
3962972 dr ritter just told us to go about our business make decisions you have to make
3962973 jim is an outstanding administrator he knows the district has the track record i cant think of a better person
3962974 he takes her to her doctors appointments and to church
3962975 the community our teachers and staff have lost confidence in our leadership team
3962976 i need to do whatevers necessary to restore confidence in the district
3962977 i have worked here 33 years and lived here nearly all my life
3962978 i know a lot of people and know them personally i have the benefit of being here all these years
3962979 everyone came to the table with a list and we immediately began reaching out to people
3962980 we had people who we interviewed who said if you can get dr
3962981 he likes that everyones calling him jim not dr ritter
3962982 jim says come to the table its symbolic of the change
3962983 a school district cannot tread water for a year an interim superintendent has to be more than a caretaker he needs to continue to move the district forward
3962984 its good we have a point person in the district for teachers and for the board it wouldnt be effective without him
3962985 having an interim allows people assigned to jobs to do their jobs without taking time out to direct themselves
3962986 ive been at rock bridge for 16 or 17 years and jim has been in the district on and off i just dont see it being a problem anyone who knows jim or who knows us knows it wont be a problem

3962991 ive been very passionate about not using the r word for years because i have seen the way it affects people

3962993 tropic thunder is a r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
3962994 no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3962995 just as a bookstore does not censor books we do not censor the movies that are released at our theaters
3962996 we do encourage our audiences to use their own judgment when selecting which movie to see

3963006 ive thought about dating girls a few times but each time i thought about it i became scared of myself i had no idea if i was wrong for thinking those things so ive been ignoring it
3963007 but when you confessed to me everything came rushing back ive never had a problem with gays its just that i was unsure about myself ive been thinking over various things like our jobs our future stuff along those lines but i realised that those things were irrelevant it was just about us i dont know if what i feel for you is more than friendship im sorry
3963008 you are a very important person to me and i feel like i need to give us a chance
3963009 ill be your girlfriend for one week after that ill give you my answer is that okay
3963010 hindi ko pa talaga napupuntahan ang luneta noon kaya na excite ako nang maisipan ni yul na magpunta kami roon
3963011 pupunta sana kami sa ocean park pero gabi na noon sarado na kaya hindi na kami nakapasok
3963012 wala kaming ginawa roon kung hindi mag picture taking lang mula luneta grandstand hanggang doon sa mapa alam mo yun nilakad namin yun okey lang nag enoy naman ako
3963013 kasama ko naman si konsehal e hindi ako na bore
3963014 yung sa eksena kasi namin ni yul parang siya lang ang naligayahan doon
3963015 ganoon kasi ang sitwasyon tinulugan niya ako at inutusan pa akong kumuha ng tubig
3963016 pero si anton mahirap yung love scene namin dahil cramped up kami sa loob ng kotse
3963017 pero bago pa yun ilang na ilang ako he made me feel at ease and comfortable
3963018 sabi ni anton ayusin na lang namin para take one yun at hindi na ulitin ibinigay na tuloy namin ang lahat
3963019 nag guest ako sa magdusa ka maliit na exposure lang yun just to test the waters at parang promo na rin ng movie namin
3963020 mas naging close talaga kami ni iwa sa taping pero okey lang talaga kami ni katrina walang naging conflict sa amin bakit naman
3963021 e noong nag taping kasi ako wala namang ibang ginagawa si katrina kung hindi matulog lang kung walang take understandable yun kasi marami rin siya raket kailangan niyang bumawi ng pahinga at magdamagan ang taping namin
3963022 hindi kami nagkaroon ng mahaba habang bonding pero nakapag usap naman kami kami ni iwa ang laging magkakuwentuhan
3963023 wala akong karapatang menosin yun dahil hindi ko pa napapanood ng buo
3963024 ang tanong kasi sa akin kung napanood ko na ang sabi ko napanood ko yung trailer i just based my answer doon sa napanood ko sa trailer na ang sabi ko okey lang naman yung nakita ko
3963025 okey in the sense na yun lang ang nakita ko and its unfair to judge sana huwag na kaming intrigahin ni katrina dahil lang doon
3963026 we try to do this kahit once a year lang di ba kahit noon pa sa lipa sa dami kasi ng trabaho at kailangang umpisahan at tapusin dito sa probinsiya ako na ang nagre request na kayo naman ang dumalaw dito para kahit papaano ma experience ninyo at makita ang mga pagbabago dito
3963027 walang katotohanan ang mga napapabalitang may ambisyon ako para sa mas mataas na posisyon gaya ng vice president o senador sa darating na 2010
3963028 when i ran here in batangas marami akong ipinangakong gagawin via our hearts health education and environment arts reconstruction roads tourism and social services programs mag iisang taon pa lang akong nakakaupo at napakalayong biyahe pa ang gagawin natin to accomplish all those things ngayon pa lang halos nagsisimula ang lahat and yet for now masasabi kong may sistema na marami nang naumpisahan sa mga ito at nakikita at na eenjoy na ito ng mga constituents ko
3963029 matagal nang problema yan matagal nang bahagi ng kasaysayan ang jueteng sa bansang ito hindi ko kailanman sinuportahan yan at never akong naging protector niyan tahasan akong kontra diyan at matindi ang pagtulong at pagsuporta ko sa mga kagaya kong nagnanais mawala iyan
3963030 lagi namang ganyan e kapag wala na silang maibatong isyu sa akin o mga kagaya ko na paglilingkod sa kapwa ang nais gawin laging sa sugalan o jueteng ka ikakabit
3963031 he is a good economist at naniniwala akong marami siyang magagawang kapaki pakinabang sa bago niyang posisyon sa gobyerno he remains and continues to be one of my solid advisers and as well as critic para sa mga programa namin dito sa lalawigan araw araw pa rin naming pinagdedebatehan ang mga isyu dito at patuloy pa rin akong natututo sa kanya
3963032 im happy for my son lucky maganda rin ang takbo ng career niya sa ngayon at sigurado akong nakikita ninyong masaya rin siya di ba may movie project din kami as part nung supposedly three picture contract ko with star cinema pero baka next year na rin yun
3963033 masaya ako sa nangyayari sa kanila ni angel nagkakatulungan sila sa maraming bagay napupunuan nila ang pagkukulang ng isat isa kaya ang feeling ko nagkakasundo talaga sila very positive ang epekto ni angel sa anak ko
3963034 ireserba natin yung two points sa mga susunod na pagkakataon
3963035 finally ay pinayagan na rin ako ng mga constituents ko to do a movie this year kayat tuloy na yung sa amin ni john lloyd cruz under star cinema naayos na ang script at inaayos na rin ang schedule ng new york shooting im thrilled dahil mahusay na artista si john lloyd bilib ako sa batang yan
3963036 im happy that finally ay na settle na nila ang isyu
3963037 nasaktan din ako sa mga lumabas na balita on them pareho silang close sa akin at nakakalungkot na senaryo yung ganun alam kong may mga tao o grupo na gagawa ng paraan para i patch up sila but still at kung kinakailangan ako na siguro yung sa huli mabuti naman at naayos the minute na pinag uusap sila updated ako sa mga nagaganap
3963038 lahat naman tayo ay nakaranas ng ganun sa isang bahagi ng buhay natin lalo nat sobrang emosyonal kaya nga laging maganda at mabuti na alamin ang pinanggalingan at pinagmumulan ng lahat and from there turn everything into positive para masaya every individual is different
3963039 mas mabilis lang siguro yung pagtanggap ko sa sarili ko ng mga pangyayari pupuwedeng kay sharon ay iba ang epekto ng mga bagay bagay kaya nga sabi ko every individual is different siguro ay hindi pa lang talaga panahon kaya nga may kanya kanyang time ang lahat kung medyo natatagalan tayo kina shawie at gabby darating din yan lets pray and wait
3963040 iyan naman ang bentahe ng may marunong magkusa at umintindi sa isyu sa showbiz kasi ang yabang ng isa ay puwedeng maging isang simpleng biro lang ng iba yung iba naman imbes na patulan pa ire reverse psychology na lang nila kahit masakit kaya again nagiging positive ang resulta
3963041 parehong malapit sa akin sina joey at willie lets give each other his due sa mga magagandang sinasabi at ginagawa naman nila gaya ng marami looking forward talaga ako sa pag uusap na gagawin nila
3963042 trabaho lang itong kakikayan ko ano ba open minded ang boyfriend ko at hindi ko na kailangang ipaliwanag pa sa kanya ang ganyang mga bagay
3963043 hindi siya nakikialam sa trabaho ko basta para sa kanya gawin ko lang ang dapat kong gawin
3963044 naku hindi ko alam wala pa siyang nasasabi tungkol diyan ang alam ko okey naman sila
3963045 hindi ko sinasabing immature ang bf ni precious pero sa experience ko kasi it takes a mature man para maintindihan itong ganitong klaseng trabaho lalo na kung out of showbiz siya
3963046 sa previous relationships ko oo may ganyan hindi yata mawawala rin yan may mga sulsol na ganyan pero its all up to me and my boyfriend to prove to people na kung sino yung napapanood na maui sa big screen hindi naman din ganoon siya sa tunay na buhay
3963047 im blessed and lucky to have a very understanding boyfriend
3963048 im sure yung bf ni pre precious nag a adjust pa yan kasi hindi pa niya alam ang sitwasyon mahirap ding basta magsalita kasi hindi naman ako ang nasa posisyon niya
3963049 i just feel sad na nabalitaan kong ganyan sana maayos pa
3963050 sobrang bait lang ni pre siya yung baguhan na gustong matuto at very friendly siya hindi siya nagpi feeling star
3963051 may respeto siya sa seniors niya at saka masaya ako ngayon kasi tahimik ang buhay ko hindi katulad noon left and right ang mga intriga sa akin
3963052 we find him very impressive with his actions despite the rumors that hes not good in acting well he proved it wrong his character really fits the role
3963053 it is the xenoan trinity it is the object that gives full power to whoever has it this is where the conflict started a battle of power between two races in this trilogy the xenoan trinity signifies the true power of unity for the greater good
3963054 alam naman ng lahat kung gaano kalaki ang katawan ko before tapos i was going through some very difficult personal problems kaya ayun hindi ko na namalayan na ang taba ko na pala
3963055 pero ive finally found a way to get back on my feet and start things fresh inuna ko muna ang physical looks ko and i was able to lose those unwanted pounds salamat siyempre sa marie france which has been helping me shed off those pounds nag focus talaga ako sa pagpapapayat and i have achieved it naman in a very safe way ngayon malaki na ang nawala sa akin pero may desired weight goal ako kaya konti pang bawas at okay na talaga ako
3963056 hindi niya ako iniwan and hes always encouraging me to look my best parati malaki ang pasasalamat ko sa kanya dahil he never gave up on me
3963057 and hes also good to my kids magkasundung magkasundo sila ng panganay kong si andrei aikos son with jomari yllana who is now nine years old panay ang bonding nilang dalawa kapag namamasyal kami with marthena aikos son with martin jickain naman who is now two years old gustung gusto niyang kargahin ito parati masaya ako kasi parang hindi na siya iba sa mga anak ko as in tanggap na siya ng mga bata at yun naman ang importante sa akin
3963058 may nagsabi lang sa akin tapos nabasa ko pa sa isang tabloid pero siyempre ayokong mag assume na totoo yon unless si jom or si pops ang makausap ko the last time na nakita at nakausap ko si jom okay naman sila ni pops kaya nakakagulat naman na may ganyang balita
3963059 sana nga ay hindi totoo kasi nakakalungkot naman mukhang okay naman silang dalawa and i wish na hindi nga totoo ang balitang hiwalay na sila
3963060 ang nagbalita sa akin ay ang mommy ko kasi nga kapag hinahatid ni martin si marthena sa bahay kasama raw niya yung girl pero hindi pa kami nagkikita talaga ulit ni martin puro text massages lang kami since nagkaroon kami ng issue
3963061 its good na may inspirasyon na rin siya noong makita ko nga ang vtr interview niya sa startalk he said na hes okay and he has moved on na thats good kasi gusto ko rin naman na masaya siya and we could still be good friends after all that has happened

3963063 im still not convinced that he actually was born a natural born citizen
3963064 masaya po kami ni katrina dahil kung tutuusin parang sinubukan lang ng gma 7 ang team up namin
3963065 ilang beses na rin po kaming nagkasama ni katrina sa tv pero hindi kami ang magkatambal kaya nakakagulat din po na madali nila kaming natanggap
3963066 maganda rin po ang feedback na natatanggap ng production nagustuhan nila ang
3963067 siguro po dahil din parehong mahuhusay ang direktor namin sina direk maryo j delos reyes who is an actors director at si direk rado peru sa second unit namin saka nakita ko rin po sa loob ng four months na magkasama kami ni katrina three times a week ang transition ng kanyang character from a kontrabida sa mga past teledrama na ginawa niya to her lead role shes very versatile very professional na kahit marami siyang ginagawa nagagampanan niyang lahat ang trabaho niya
3963068 hindi ko po alam kung anong meron sila ni marvin pero ang alam ko kami ni katrina ang magka partner at okey naman sa akin si katrina
3963069 nag reshoot nga po kami ng ilang eksena kahapon august 12 iyon po kasing huling nai shoot ko nagkaproblema sa prosthetics almost 4 00 a m na po kasi iyon medyo pagod na kami lahat hindi po naging maayos ang pagkalagay ng prosthetics kaya nang mapanood po ang rushes hindi maayos kaya nag reshoot kami
3963070 nakakatawa nga po kasi ang dami nang nangyari sa akin
3963071 naging problema po namin ay ang scheduling dahil pareho kaming naging busy ni judy ann lumaki na rin po si sharlene at humaba na muli ang kanyang buhok at least po ngayon magda dubbing na lang kami at maipalalabas na rin

3963073 nakakatuwa na po si calix dahil nagta try na siyang magsalita ang first word na sinabi niya dada nadadala ko rin siya sa bahay pero hindi pa siya nag o overnight sa akin dahil mahirap pong ihiwalay kay carlene umiiyak
3963074 kahit ang parents ko kapag hindi ko nadala sa kanila si calix sila ang pumupunta sa bahay nina carlene
3963075 napansin ko na rin na mahilig siya sa sounds minsang nasa condominium ko siya narinig niya ang pagda drums ko nakita kong para rin siyang nagtatambol kaya ibinili ko siya ng hand drum iyon tinatambol niya
3963076 hindi naman maiiwasan ang mga ganyan e alam namin na marami ang naghihintay for the movie at one year in the making na nga ito pero mga 70 percent of the movie na ang na shoot namin may mga eksena na kaming nakunan dito e yung mga scenes na lang sa u s ang kulang kapag okey na ang lahat at matuloy na kami mga ten days of shooting ang gagawin namin so malamang na baka early next year na ito maipalabas
3963077 kung inakala nila na madali ang show naku hindi po
3963078 kahit na once a week lang kami grabe ang taping namin sa isang taping day three episodes ang binubuo namin tapos may mga shoot pa kami sa labas ng studio may voice over commentary kami na ilang oras din ang binubuhos namin so its hard work pero enjoy naman kami kasi nakakatuwa ang mga contestants game na game sila sa show

3963095 i cant say if the card was justified or not because i didnt see the play but it is extremely difficult to play a game when you lose a man by the fourth minute

3963103 climate change should be seen as the greatest challenge to ever face mankind
3963104 if i were reincarnated i would wish to be returned to earth as a killer virus to lower human population levels
3963105 i i thought we were going to die i was so scared
3963106 i noticed to myself that it was different than an regular cop vehicle
3963107 it was smaller and the lights were not on top flashing and the headlights werent flashing
3963108 there was an altercation bottles or smirnoff bottles thrown at his vehicle and he felt that a gun was pointed at him and he defended himself
3963109 the problem with americans is they have an unfortunate habit of seeing the world through an american lens
3963110 you know education if you make the most of it if you study hard and you do your homework and you make an effort to be smart uh you you can do well if you dont you get stuck in iraq
3963111 and there is no reason bob that young american soldiers need to be going into the homes of iraqis in the dead of night terrorizing kids and children you know women breaking sort of the customs of the of the historical customs religious customs whether you like it or not iraqis should be doing that
3963112 they told stories at times they had personally raped cut off ears cut off heads taped wires from portable telephones to human genitals and turned up the power cut off limbs blown up bodies randomly shot at civilians razed villages in fashion reminiscent of genghis khan shot cattle and dogs for fun poisoned food stocks and generally ravaged the countryside of south vietnam in addition to the normal ravage of war and the normal and particular ravaging which is done by the applied bombing power of this country
3963113 senator kennedy killed that girl the same as if he put a gun to her head and pulled the trigger
3963114 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia
3963115 with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds
3963116 how did it come about that highly sensitive technical information was given to the chinese why did the president ignore the national security experts who counseled against this deal what damage has been done to our national security

3963118 indeed some of israels best friends and most articulate defenders can be found in the blogosphere little green footballs atlas shrugs hugh hewitt and debbie schlussel all provide a refreshing alternative to the moral relativism and politically correct anti israel blather of the media
3963119 we are perishing for want of wonder not for want of wonders
3963120 if you can become aware of the miraculousness which i symbolise you can help save the freedom mankind is unhappily losing
3963121 we will re center american foreign policy by responsibly redeploying our combat forces from iraq and refocusing them on urgent missions we will give our military a new mission ending this war and giving iraq back to its people we will be as careful getting out of iraq as we were careless getting in we can safely remove our combat brigades at the pace of one to two per month and expect to complete redeployment within 16 months after this redeployment we will keep a residual force in iraq to perform specific missions targeting terrorists protecting our embassy and civil personnel and advising and supporting iraqs security forces provided the iraqis make political progress
3963122 for more than three decades israelis palestinians arab leaders and the rest of the world have looked to america to lead the effort to build the road to a secure and lasting peace our starting point must always be our special relationship with israel grounded in shared interests and shared values and a clear strong fundamental commitment to the security of israel our strongest ally in the region and its only established democracy that commitment which requires us to ensure that israel retains a qualitative edge for its national security and its right to self defense is all the more important as we contend with growing threats in the region a strengthened iran a chaotic iraq the resurgence of al qaeda the reinvigoration of hamas and hezbollah we support the implementation of the memorandum of understanding that pledges 30 billion in assistance to israel over the next decade to enhance and ensure its security
3963123 step back and take a look at who you have on the team and blame them
3963124 hey who the hell is talking to me i live alone
3963125 you may call me walter mr dannon at your service
3963126 walter okay so where am i and what am i doing here
3963127 yes well that question requires a bit more of an involved response im afraid the short answer is that you are in hell specifically my office in hell
3963128 in fact i feel pretty damn good all things considered
3963129 oh its a worse hangover than you think youve died in fact and you are now in hell physically however you shouldnt be feeling any pain or for that matter anything at all which means you are probably feeling better than you have since you can last remember
3963130 so if im dead and this is hell i suppose you must be the devil huh
3963131 oh no mr dannon i am most certainly not the devil although i do appreciate the compliment no im more of a regional manager you might say
3963132 okay so if im in hell wheres the lake of fire and the dead souls in agony suffering for all eternity seems kinda calm for hell if you ask me
3963133 ah yes the infamous lake of fire its actually not quite as bad as all that down here although i suppose some would say its all relative not surprisingly certain individuals on earth have made quite a few errors when it comes to describing a place that they have yet to actually visit for themselves
3963134 so youre telling me theres no lake of fire in hell then
3963135 and youre not the devil just one of his minions
3963136 its a little more complicated than that but in a manner of speaking yes
3963137 uh huh well if i really am dead why should i be in hell anyway ive led a decent life
3963138 ah yes of course a very decent life to be sure mr dannon if not somewhat over indulgent with certain vices but youll find that where you end up has little to do with your sense of moral decency or lack thereof in your case we traded for you
3963139 oh just what it sounds like we traded for you all we had to give up was a child molesting priest who was extremely penitent and a future option in the latter part of the year 2012 it was quite a coup for us in fact
3963140 okay i get it this is all very funny and you almost had me going for a minute there but if you dont mind id like to get out of here and get home now
3963141 oh and could you let me know whatever that stuff is you gave me to cure my hangover i really do feel pretty good
3963142 mr dannon i know its a little hard to take all of this in right now but by the way is there anything i can do to make you feel more at ease im not your enemy you know
3963143 well you can stop referring to me as mr dannon im only 26 well was only 26 i guess
3963144 curt as i was saying curt i know its a little hard to take all of this in right now you did just die after all and your whole life youve been presented with a version of hell that doesnt actually exist but suffice it to say that you are indeed dead and you are here with us because someone in upper management thought you would be a nice addition you have alot of potential it seems
3963145 for helping us live up to our potential of course we strive to be the best that we can be what is it you think we do down here exactly
3963146 i dunno its hell isnt it dont you punish evil people for their sinful lives or something like that
3963147 well we like to think of it as rehabilitation but yes there are those who are being punished still thats really just a side effect of our ultimate goal
3963148 our ultimate goal mr dannon excuse me curt you are one of us now
3963149 well thats certainly understandable given your worldly biases and mistaken ideas about the way things are but i assure you that those biases will fall away before long and i further assure you that you have no choice either way
3963150 oh that wasnt a threat not at all just an observation of the way things are you are one of us now whether you have come to accept that or not the other side has no interest in your er particular talents as ive told you already they gave you to us for a child molestor now i ask you is that the kind of place that you would rather be in
3963151 i dunno i havent been there yet thanks to you apparently
3963152 touche my good fellow touche but again they are not interested in your talents up there we on the other hand wish to embrace and nurture your talents so that you may reach your full potential in this game we call existence
3963153 my talents huh okay ill bite what are these talents you keep talking about anyway im pretty much a nobody
3963154 oh no curtwood dannon you are most certainly not a nobody you just havent found the right outlet for your skills as of yet fortunately for you however youve ended up in just the right place for that very thing now why dont you relax and let me explain just what it is that we can do for you and i think you might find yourself pleasantly surprised and even a bit more optimistic about your future
3963155 of course they found all this stuff on her it was planted on her
3963156 she is the ultimate victim of the american dark side

3963164 a large flood of spiritual revelation of a direct and profound character
3963165 the greatest gospel of spiritual works ever yet given to the race
3963166 no written shastra however great its authority or however large its spirit can be more than a partial expression of the eternal knowledge
3963167 may be governed for a long time by one scripture or by several successively if it is in the line of the great hindu tradition by the gita for example the upanishads the veda or it may be a good part of his development to include in its material a richly varied experience of the truths of many scriptures and make the future opulent with all that is best in the past but in the end he must take his station or better still if he can always and from the beginning he must live in his own soul beyond the written truth sabdabrahmativartate beyond all that he has heard and all that he has yet to hear srotavyasya srutasya ca for he is not the sadhaka of a book or of many books he is a sadhaka of the infinite
3963168 the written or traditional teaching expresses the knowledge and experiences of many centuries systemized organized made attainable to the beginner its importance and utility are therefore immense but a great freedom of variation and development is always practicable the general knowledge on which the yoga depends is fixed but the order the succession the devices the forms must be allowed to vary for the needs and particular impulsions of the individual nature have to be satisfied even while the general truths remain firm and constant
3963169 any integral and synthetic yoga needs especially not to be bound by any written or traditional shastra for while it embraces the knowledge received from the past it seeks to organize it anew for the present and the future an absolute liberty of experience and of the restatement of knowledge in new terms and new combinations is the condition of its self formation
3963170 yoga has long diverged from life and the ancient systems which sought to embrace it such as those of our vedic forefathers these are far away from us expressed in terms which are no longer accessible thrown into forms which are no longer applicable since then mankind has moved forward on the current of eternal time and the same problem has to be approached from a new starting point
3963171 vivekananda pointing out that the unity of all religions must necessarily express itself by an increasing richness of variety in its forms said once that the perfect state of that essential unity would come when each man had his own religion when not bound by sect or traditional form he followed the free self adaptation of his nature in its relations with the supreme
3963172 so also one may say that the perfection of the integral yoga will come when each man is able to follow his own path of yoga pursuing the development of his own nature in its upsurging towards that which transcends the nature for freedom is the final law and the last consummation
3963173 but these must take as much as possible forms of general truths general statements of principle the most powerful broad directions of effort and development rather than a fixed system which has to be followed as a routine
3963174 character is revealed in bad times as well as great times if youre able to stay focused
3963175 that reveals a lot of character doing what you need to do doing it because you know youre preparing for tomorrow youre not preparing for right now
3963176 if you blow a team out you have to think about the fact that your team executed and did everything they needed to do
3963177 focusing on us worrying about our execution worrying about executing on offense playing hard on defense blocking out rebounding controlling the things we can control
3963178 you cant help but be focused thats why were here were here for one reason and thats to win a gold medal each outing each minute we play each practice we have is building toward winning a gold medal

3963191 the msp430 remains uniquely qualified for a specific set of ultra low power applications such as small handheld meters or remote sensors weve captured in print the techniques essential for success with these applications allowing shorter development schedules reduced maintenance costs and more attractive venture capital presentations
3963192 one common assumption of many of our clients on day one is that their green application needs an ultra low power controller such as the msp430 on the other hand we think that about 80 to 90 percent of the applications weve seen throughout our work would now be better handled with modern controllers that are becoming available from other chip makers those oems with projects in the remaining ten to twenty percent need this book to stay competitive
3963193 we played a key role in the early success of the msp430 and now by shifting our focus we will help our customers get even better results in the green wave
3963194 this cowardly attack on unarmed aid workers yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent
3963195 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
3963196 they were driving in a land cruiser with a clear irc logo on it
3963197 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3963198 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community help the poverty hit afghan people
3963199 reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted in this way
3963200 nothing can justify such an attack on people whose lives are devoted to helping the people of afghanistan
3963201 humanitarian workers should be protected by the principles of neutrality and impartiality and must not be targeted as they appear to be at present in afghanistan
3963202 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
3963203 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001
3963204 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
3963205 people think these kids are all violent and theyre all out fighting and shooting most of our children want to grow up in a peaceful community where they can live their lives and become successful adults

3963210 im proposing that we have a new privacy bill of rights that secures the interests of consumers
3963211 people have the right to know what is happening to their personal information when they are cooperating with a business and to make decisions about how their information is used
3963212 will strengthen privacy protections for the digital age and will harness the power of technology to hold government and business accountable for violations of personal privacy
3963213 only about 20 to 25 percent of hospitals and 15 to 20 percent of physicians offices have a hit system
3963214 up front and phased out 3 billion a year investment fund would be provided to help hospitals and doctors offices to adopt and implement hit

3963218 server core is designed for companies that have many servers some of which need only to perform dedicated tasks but with outstanding stability or in environments where high security requirements require a minimal attack surface on the server
3963219 we stood up well because we were so young in the middle of the park
3963220 of course for a game of that level you could be worried but i have confidence in them and i must say i have been paid back very well
3963221 we expected a difficult game and we were not disappointed they man marked us all over the pitch and we needed to be patient and not make any mistakes at the back
3963222 we changed a bit tactically at half time but most important they dropped their level a bit to do what they did in the first half to tackle for every ball is of course very difficult and from then on we looked a bit more comfortable
3963223 its a massive mountain to climb its bigger than everest but we take heart from the performance
3963224 i said before that this game isnt just about now but also the future i like what i see of this team we showed we are a good team who can compete with the likes of arsenal
3963225 we go away thinking 2 0 is an unbelievable result because of the performance we put in
3963226 thats what happens in europe against the top teams the inexperience in the dressing room showed and we have to learn from it but i cant fault the performance we had arsenal rattled especially in the first half
3963227 what you need to know to get the best jobs and the big bucks
3963228 im tremendously disappointed weve been here nearly five years we have lots of friends and family
3963229 life goes on and well make the most of it wherever we end up

3963235 the last few years contestants have gone in knowing what to expect so they kind of play the game
3963236 the mccain campaign has obviously decided to play the national security card over the russia georgia contretemps with the hope that the sight of john mccain banging his cane on the ground will make the country feel safe

3963245 the abc has as much right as any other media organisation to defend its copyright and ive no doubt crikey would do the same in a similar situation being the national broadcaster doesnt mean the abc should have to surrender its copyright so that another party this time crikey can show abc footage without paying usage fees
3963246 yesterday item 21 i have recently bought an apartment in glen iris a relatively inner city suburb of melbourne optus were unable to provide me with a fixed line home phone adsl or cable internet nor foxtel hd i work with someone who lives in the same block who does have optus fixed line home phone and adsl connected i queried optus on three separate occasions and never received a full answer but the most plausible was that they were unable to get new lines from the telstra controlled exchanges so i am now the proud new owner of a telstra home phone line a bigpond cable internet connection and foxtel hd why because i had no choice i have been an optus mobile phone customer for 11 years and been reasonably happy if only telstra now offered me a decent incentive to change that also i probably would but having just signed a new 24 month contract with optus for an iphone it wont be soon five million customers migrating sol should not be too hard if my experience is anything to go by corruption autocracy and democracy again again
3963247 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
3963248 i think hes undisputedly the greatest swimmer of all time
3963249 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
3963250 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
3963251 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3963252 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3963253 he is not from another planet he is from the future
3963254 being on the team with him these past couple of years a lot of us take what he does for granted
3963255 we expect him to break world records we expect him to win
3963256 now through translations we are seeing a lot of growth in international countries
3963257 what kind of father would take his own daughters rights away what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she was gay

3963260 the white population is older and very much centered around the who are well past their high fertility years
3963261 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
3963262 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
3963263 o foco do nosso laborat rio s o as doen as negligenciadas o objetivo desse projeto era estudar os venenos de diversos anf bios como ferramenta para a busca de novos f rmacos depois de uma triagem feita com diversos animais elegemos o sapo cururu j que ele mostrava aspectos interessantes para bioprospec o
3963264 essas mol culas s o mais interessantes do ponto de vista farmac utico por serem menores e mais f ceis de sintetizar
3963265 a gl ndula pareot ide do sapo conta com uma quantidade imensa de veneno que tem uma toxicidade imensa mas com a purifica o da mol cula ativa eliminamos a parte t xica e testamos o elemento ativo no parasita
3963266 curiosamente descobrimos na literatura que a telocinobufagina produzida tamb m pelo organismo humano n o foi muito estudada mas possivelmente tem fun es no controle da press o sang nea
3963267 n o sabemos ainda se o sapo usa esses ester ides para prote o mas poss vel que como vivem em um lugar seco e t m pele muito sens vel eles sirvam para defender o animal de fungos e bact rias no ch o
3963268 inclusive no pouco estudado bioma da caatinga jared levantou a hip tese de que os ester ides s o possivelmente incorporados pelo sapo por meio da dieta
3963269 essas mol culas j eram conhecidas em plantas da regi o mas at agora n o haviam sido observadas no sapo possivelmente elas s o conseguidas pelo animal por meio de um inseto que ingeriu determinadas plantas
3963270 tudo isso faz com que essas mol culas sejam modelos interessantes agora que identificamos sua estrutura qu mica vamos tentar sintetiz las e testar novos desenhos com potencial para uma efici ncia ainda maior o passo seguinte ser a aplica o de testes em animais
3963271 em 2007 tivemos 256 casos e 21 bitos at tr s meses atr s haviam sido registrados 35 casos e dois bitos no estado em 2008
3963272 usamos at hoje o metal antim nio cuja aplica o foi feita pela primeira vez em 1912 os medicamentos s o extremamente t xicos para a doen a de chagas s h um rem dio que tem 50 de efic cia se for administrado no in cio da doen a mas o problema que s se descobre a doen a quando ela est avan ada
3963273 a efici ncia m dia de remo o de s lidos em suspens o foi de cerca de 60 para os tanques com brita e de 33 para os tanques com bambu os valores m dios de mat ria org nica foram de 22 miligramas por litro mg l com 60 de efici ncia de remo o para os tanques de pedra brita e de 36 mg l com 33 de efici ncia de remo o para os constru dos com leito de bambu
3963274 a planta cresce em cima do esgoto que serve como uma esp cie de adubo natural para as esp cies o sistema lembra o processo de hidroponia acrescido da a o de microrganismos outra vantagem que ele n o necessita de nenhum tipo de produto qu mico ou eletricidade
3963275 em uma popula o rural por exemplo seria poss vel plantar esp cies ornamentais para venda as fibras do caule do papiro uma das plantas que melhor se adaptaram ao sistema tamb m podem ser usadas para artesanato na confec o de produtos como papel ou lumin rias
3963276 i found it interesting that they failed to mention the pipeline in regards to russias invasion
3963277 do not let anyone tell you that you are not better than them because you are
3963278 you have deserved this you are hitler the fourth alexander the great the second napoleon the fifth here to destroy the world we know
3963279 i would love to be a doctor so i could check little boys for problems in their private areas
3963280 i dont think i make enough money with my teaching job so i also have a job as a stripper
3963281 neither of them will be returning they will be going to public school through open enrollment
3963282 when water is incorporated into food or shakes satiety is increased and subjects ultimately eat less food
3963283 you try to save as much emotional energy before your race as you can because youre going to need it at the end
3963284 i just tried to keep myself calm ever since yesterdays semi so i thought i did that and came out and did a pb when it mattered most
3963285 my heart was in the mouth a bit but to see second next to my name is just fantastic im just so happy

3963288 people need to be waking up to the realities of the world and that the days of easy money have come to a pretty sudden end
3963289 there is an awful lot of talk about big transfers and major demands of players but you will find throughout the uk and europe that money is not quite as easy to obtain as it used to be
3963290 were expecting the levels of transfer fees this summer to still to be quite high but probably not as high as the record that was set last summer
3963291 euro 2008 happened towards the start of the summer transfer window
3963292 the level of transfer activity at the start of a window sometimes decreases when there is a major tournament taking place
3963293 another factor is that the 2008 09 season is the second year of a three year broadcast deal and the level of broadcasting revenues to clubs this year will be broadly similar to what they received last year
3963294 so were not seeing a step change in the amount of revenues that clubs are getting year on year
3963295 another point is weve not seen anything like the number of changes in club ownership in the last 12 months compared to the previous 12 months
3963296 there arent several new owners of premier league clubs for whom this window is their first opportunity to buy and sell players so i think thats another factor
3963297 would i turn my nose up at another round with shodan no
3963298 weve been on the epa to get us a list of these tanks
3963299 there has been no communication with our agency on any of this
3963300 if they went in during the cold war the chances that they are leaking are really really good
3963301 yang and jiang have high potential and i think they can confront shawn johnson
3963302 this is a competition its fair play so i really hope these members can do their utmost so the public and the whole world of gymnastics can see their best performance
3963303 i feel they really are the best gymnasts at this tournament the best complete gymnasts
3963304 i have predicted the outcome either me first her second or her first me second either way we will push each other hard and we are ready to go and fight together
3963305 i can only hope and pray usa will come out on top
3963306 its going to be great knowing that i have my team mate right there helping me and ill be helping her too of course she and i are both going for gold you dont work to go for a silver
3963307 if im an attacker and my user and kernel rootkits work 80 per cent of the time then why go create a virtual rootkit which is infinitely harder to deploy
3963308 the use of rootkit technologies is prevalent in the malware families our filters are picking up today
3963309 most commonly these tend to be spambots recent examples include srizbi and rustock
3963310 harmony is delighted with the progress made in both of these companies since our original investments one and two years ago respectively we expect the listings to occur by 2009 which assuming p e ratios comparable to others in their industries is expected to deliver significant returns on our original investment our strategic approach of value added investing has been borne out by the progress made by these companies which demonstrates harmonys ability to partner with management to develop a business strategy and effective management structure that results in above average returns for shareholders
3963311 whos to say where it will end up but now he has a lot going on
3963312 if she said she wants kids and hes not ready thats not being needy its being honest
3963313 it is really a cooling off not this big dramatic breakup
3963314 these are mature people who talk about things maturely its just slowed down
3963315 it is really a cooling off not this big dramatic breakup
3963316 they had a great time together but report did jennifer aniston and john mayer split
3963317 they had a great time together but they are just in different places in their lives right now
3963318 madalyn not only gives me marketing strategies during our consultations but she gets me thinking in a whole new direction
3963319 madalyn s high energy can do attitude was the shot that i needed to get me going
3963320 madalyn has played a key role in helping me build a strong foundation for my music business
3963321 hope is not a human achievement but gods gift through the power of the holy spirit
3963322 dream dreams for ministry big enough to know that the results cannot depend on us alone but rather on god
3963323 unsaved and unchurched people believing that the heart of jesus mission was to seek and save the lost
3963324 the heart of jesus mission was to seek and to save the lost
3963325 if for this life only we have hoped we are of all people most to be pitied
3963326 if for eternal life only we have hoped we are most to be pitied
3963327 dream dreams for ministry big enough to know that the results cannot depend on us alone but rather on god
3963328 the most active period of liquidation sales in 10 years
3963329 the whitehall liquidation was ordered after exhaustive efforts to sell the specialty retail chain or obtain fresh equity both proved unsuccessful
3963330 as whitehall has been a leading specialty retailer in fine jewelry for more than a century it is unfortunate that a brand with such strong heritage has to be liquidated
3963331 oil and gas companies that hedge their production to protect cash flow had a tough second quarter in 08 and range was no exception
3963332 larger than usual mark to market adjustment resulted from the unprecedented increase in crude oil prices and volatility during the period
3963333 the dearth of information available regarding the trading strategy and its impact upon the value of the debtors businesses has caused significant unrest and concern among the debtors customers suppliers lenders and investors
3963334 if indeed there is a probe we would fully cooperate with it
3963335 our core business in energy distribution and storage remains strong and we are taking aggressive steps to address our financial challenge
3963336 while the company has sufficient liquidity to make its interest payment management intends to avail itself of the 30 day grace period and is looking into a restructuring of the companys capital structure
3963337 corporations acknowledge that they need to understand the material risks to their value drivers therefore the number of cfos focusing a portion of their time on risk has gone up
3963338 the cro position is fast becoming a best practice among large companies
3963339 given our size and complexity and the highly regulated industry in which we operate separating the financial and audit fuctions and increasing our focus on risk identification and mitigation is a prudent move
3963340 the cro title isnt as prevalent as we all might think
3963341 the cro position is still trying to find its place in corporate america
3963342 the cfo doesnt have the capability to assess the collectibility of loan portfolios
3963343 no issues with the police or with neighbours he was quiet
3963344 as i understand it if it is true the defendant did not even know about it
3963345 all i know is mr johnsons statement that he was threatened with a knife
3963346 if michael wanted to kill lisa he would have killed her and ran
3963347 i didnt intend for this to happen it is a bad thing
3963348 the special committee would consider a proposal that recognizes the value of the company and reflects the significant benefits that would accrue to roche as a result of full ownership
3963349 at some price however high the independent directors are willing sellers
3963350 roche continues to believe its proposal is fair and generous
3963351 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
3963352 for whatever reason i think he has decided hes going to endorse obama i think powell has a high respect for senator mccain they go back a long way
3963353 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama
3963354 from relaxing on lobbyist paid vacations to shielding jailed lobbyist jack abramoff from public accountability roger wicker seems to be busy in washington taking care of everyone except the people who elected him
3963355 getting free massages at fancy resorts when youre supposed to be on a fact finding mission does not pass the smell test for most mississippians mississippians deserve to know the truth about roger wicker and his special interest loyalties and the more they learn about his record the more theyll want wicker out of office
3963356 theres lots of available office space in the 1st congressional district and we have very much enjoyed having our office there
3963357 we chose that space because the office is literally at the busiest intersection in the state right near the mall were in the district and in boise
3963358 there is no question that the huge effort to register and turn out voters at ohio state university is going to have a positive impact on our race
3963359 from a practical business perspective when big companies and their legal teams look at creative commons there are a number of questions
3963360 its been one of the things their legal teams throw at us
3963361 but i thought it was the right thing to do
3963362 he works out an hour a day and walks with his big dog on his farm in sun valley idaho
3963363 not definite yet but is one of the people they are seriously looking at
3963364 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3963365 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3963366 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3963367 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3963368 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3963369 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3963370 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3963377 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3963378 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3963379 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3963380 dont you want a picture of the seal the seal of the navy
3963381 he never said his name he was sure to learn my name but he never said his
3963382 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3963383 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3963384 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3963385 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3963462 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3963463 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
3963464 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3963465 we work very closely with local authorities we dont work anywhere where we are not wanted
3963466 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community to help the poverty hit afghan people
3963467 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
3963468 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001
3963469 thats a lot to ask when the service member has much more important things on their minds such as staying alive and keeping those around them alive
3963470 because the soldiers dont pay a dime our waiver of the fees amounts to a discount to the military not a discount to soldiers
3963471 soldiers should not have to pay a penny of it

3963478 my father was a geo physicist working for mobil oil with a degree in biochemistry for a long time he worked with another guy who went on a fossil dig because he had a friend there who was supervising it
3963479 because we are trying to re create the scene and explain what happened here and these things dont fit the story
3963480 my father was a geo physicist working for mobil oil with a degree in biochemistry for a long time he worked with another guy who went on a fossil dig because he had a friend there who was supervising it

3963505 this fight is a big test for shane terry smith has been in the ring with some of the worlds best heavyweights hes skilled and hes tough and has never been stopped
3963506 i will talk to manny and see what i can do
3963507 this a once in a lifetime opportunity for manny and you dont dismiss that kind of opportunity just like that
3963508 i have been informed that oscar de la hoya is firm with the 70 30 revenue sharing and wont budge in to the 60 40 split we have counter offered the option left is to move on
3963509 manny needs to fight three or four times in order to earn what he is projected to earn from the de la hoya fight
3963510 so you need to think twice before missing that opportunity also money is not our only consideration here because we know that pacquiao has a genuine chance of beating de la hoya and when that happens that will be a great historical feat
3963511 jacobs blog is consistently wittier more interesting and more up to date than mine but at least i make more money than hi dammit
3963512 we hope the new policy will help restrain the production and sales of high emission vehicles while promoting the development of low emission cars
3963513 some club goers want to enjoy different drinks some want to watch famous djs performances some just want a break compared with eight years ago i have more choices in shenzhens nightlife
3963514 every time i go to a new city i like to explore it
3963515 for the early part of my stay in shenzhen there were only a couple of bars and we got bored of going to the same places all the time
3963516 the music which was fast heavy and hard was not suitable for foreigners and we called it chinese techno
3963517 the bar had many choices of much better quality music including hip hop house disco and pop but later the owners closed good fellas and opened u bar
3963518 in hong kong especially in lan kwai fong you can enjoy different kinds of cocktails or wine sold by the glass but shenzhen bars sell their spirits by the bottle so the quantity is too much for a small group and it is expensive in addition although shenzhen bars look different in their appearance they sell almost the same products and service is still very slow theres still room for improvement
3963519 computing that was happening on a workstation platform moved to the data center because applications became more intensive and the workstations couldnt keep up
3963520 what that meant to scientists and engineers was if they didnt work for an organization that could afford a data center they didnt have access to those precious resources gpus like the tesla t10p bring computing back to the workstation
3963521 how can electrification be the number one achievement of the last century if more than 1 6 billion people live without it
3963522 explain why water supply and distribution makes it onto the list when 1 1 billion people lack adequate access to water and 2 6 billion lack basic sanitation
3963523 our customers tell us that they want more performance but they want it at no extra cost
3963524 with a multicore approach we are able to give them the benefit of higher performance within a single package and that reduces the number of components which reduces the cost
3963525 car manufacturers are moving toward dsp because it allows them to do all the sound equalization in the car
3963526 because its done in software instead of hardware they can use one hardware platform across all car models and use software to compensate for the differences
3963527 the adoption of tools such as pxi is an indicator that companies recognize the benefits of moving toward software defined instruments the savings being realized in capital equipment system development and improvements in system efficiency all contribute to reducing the per unit cost of tests directly influencing the bottom line
3963528 the membrane is the most expensive component in an electrolyser
3963529 weve talked to big and small companies the big ones are less nimble than smaller ones and theyll come when they are ready
3963530 close your eyes and imagine a ball of wool in your two hands now take giant scissors and snip it all up and ball it up in your hands its still a ball of wool
3963531 one has to be very careful with these kinds of announcements there are a number of people who can make these membranes and theres many different varieties the issue is always lifetime and that takes a while to bear out
3963532 it sounds interesting but it awaits outside verification we all have to be from missouri show me
3963533 i cant tell what the durability is because we cant identify a failure mechanism
3963534 we dont expect them to believe our claim unless they kick our tires well price them just below existing electrolysers and keep reducing prices until we are sold out and have proven its commercially viable
3963535 what weve done is a complete step change one u s group told us weve jumped two generations ahead of the world
3963536 i believe there are opportunities to simplify our safety systems using integrated safety its something were definitely looking at for the future
3963537 we replicated what disney has been doing in standard hardware
3963538 its already ubiquitous on every pc so its obvious to say that we should be putting usb devices on our chips
3963539 die casting requires heating and keeping a large amount of metal in a molten state
3963540 thats a large draw from an energy standpoint with injection molding youre only heating a small amount of metal at any one time
3963541 to work in a conventional injection molding machine you want the material to behave like a polymer does
3963542 you want a viscosity that isnt too high or too low over a wide range of temperatures
3963543 we believe that sustainable biofuels are the right way to go
3963544 thats why weve committed to making half of our u s production e85 capable by 2012
3963545 we know that gasoline and food prices are going to stay high
3963546 so the question is this do you want to send your hard earned u s dollars to a saudi prince or an american farmer ethanol gives you that choice
3963547 for the most part were converting starches into sugar and then into alcohol in the exact same manner that weve used since the beginning of time
3963548 whats changed is that the process has been made simpler more efficient and more cost effective
3963549 but a turned metal fuel tank typically isnt very happy with it
3963550 all it knows is that the air fuel ratio is changing
3963551 in a low volume vehicle the costs will be a little higher
3963552 with a high volume vehicle you can spread the costs out a little more
3963553 most estimates leave out the energy from farm labor the energy to make and manufacture the tractor and the energy required for irrigation
3963554 by omitting nearly half of the inputs theyre able to demonstrate that the corn plant is collecting more energy than it takes to make the ethanol but it just isnt true
3963555 when you separate the wheat from the chaff youll find that those estimates are based on 20 year old data
3963556 the cellulosics have an energy balance of about seven or eight to one which is very attractive
3963557 the cost is also about a dollar per gallon which is also very attractive
3963558 someone might spend an entire lifetime trying to find organisms like these
3963559 its not like were looking for massive inventions or major breakthroughs to make this work
3963560 despite all the research theres no evidence that cellulose is going to be profitable in terms of energy or economics
3963561 theres a lot of hope and i like the hope myself but we havent seen results yet
3963562 its pretty clear that feedstocks such as corn are charting the path
3963563 the idea of working towards an alternative fuel made a lot of sense to us partly because so much of our senior leadership had worked in brazil
3963564 the consumers will have a choice to make its just a matter of where they want their dollar to go
3963565 its a theory that any beer drinker understands the glass starts full and ends empty and the faster you drink it the quicker its gone
3963566 people will get excited about the car and that will drive fueling availability its difficult to make a business case for selling the hydrogen car when there is no demand its all a matter of volume
3963567 its very important customers have an excellent experience and get convenient fueling
3963568 automotive companies are investing significant sums of money but they still have not made that full commitment nor do i think they should
3963569 transition to hydrogen fcvs amp the potential hydrogen energy infrastructure
3963570 we see pathways to overcome the remaining challenges but our view there is no silver bullet there is no one answer
3963571 it looks like well commit to a 70 percent reduction by 2050 and that will require either hydrogen or electricity as the primary energy source for light duty vehicles who wins the race the fuel cell or the battery they both have a ways to go before theyre competitive with the hybrid internal combustion engine if we have a break through in batteries well see plug in vehicles thats the contest
3963572 costs will come down an order of magnitude with mass production but there are supply issues the whole supply base has to be built
3963573 hybrids today are great but you cant hybrid ize your way into energy security you have to move to alternatives to oil
3963574 a key point is that even with hydrogen from natural gas we get a 60 percent reduction in co2 from well to wheel
3963575 its too high in cost and a honda customer would be disappointed if it only lasted for 100 000 miles it has to be at least as good as traditional automobiles and have a stunning design
3963576 thats the 48 billion dollar question moving to a whole new technology is a scary business
3963577 the industrial revolution started 150 years ago and were just getting out of it any new technology takes time it just takes time hydrogen is further ahead than anyone dreamed it would be 10 years ago
3963578 we believe that it is necessary to operate with existing fuels in combination with hydrogen the second reason is because internal combustion engines are so well developed production repair maintenance and efficiency are well known in the industry
3963579 the hydrogen engine can be developed to the point where it is incredibly efficient
3963580 the most significant thing in terms of cost is the super insulated hydrogen tank if you put a cup of hot coffee in the tank it would still be warm after three months the super insulation is necessary to keep the liquid hydrogen from warming up it is stored at 450f
3963581 sealing is important because hydrogen is extremely evasive but hydrogen storage is no more dangerous than gasoline
3963582 we should not pick winners and losers because we do not want to exclude other technologies there are macs and pcs cable and the dish and ipods and mp3 players but hydrogen looks like the most promising energy carrier for the future
3963583 designing a vehicle from the ground up gives you a lot of design flexibility you can pretty much gut the front end of the car
3963584 the big design challenge is we built it from the ground up but used the existing platform
3963585 if these allegations are true the fbi has identified serious weaknesses in the security at one of nations premier laboratories
3963586 thats as close to a smoking gun as i think youre going to get
3963587 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3963588 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
3963589 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3963590 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3963591 eu credito a redu o n o s ao aumento da fiscaliza o mas a esses acordos setoriais com as cadeias produtivas que n s temos feito com a madeira com o min rio com a soja em alguns casos s o at mais eficientes os acordos com as cadeias produtivas que apenas a fiscaliza o direta
3963592 i think with factories and businesses operating with minimal staffing during the daytime its hard for them to let people go
3963593 for a couple of our members unless its something big they cannot leave for some even if it is something big they cant leave
3963594 i am comfortable with 20 but i dont like to drop below that number
3963595 i would take another four people right now if they were available
3963596 the fire district kicks in an amount of money per year and then that grows with interest until the firefighter turns 65
3963597 the only incentive is the great camaraderie and the fun stuff we do as a department like a christmas party or the summer picnic
3963598 for the project 16 writers travelled across the country to talk to housewives vigilantes homosexuals drug addicts policemen and sex workers and served up engaging essays on the disease and its fallout in india
3963599 this anthology is a huge achievement it is critically important to recognise that the aids epidemic is primarily a crisis of human lives we are in it together
3963600 there were these unique workshops the rent was low and we were able to freely create art here
3963601 people here are more open to our work and they respect us as contemporary artists
3963602 but in other places such as yuanmingyuan and songzhuang where established artists gather our works are often not accepted
3963603 the art district has really degenerated into an art theme park instead of a real soho like art district
3963604 the district has become a fashionable spot with a fake art feel
3963605 cmon you guys this is a school for christs sake take it somwhere else
3963606 shawn do you have any idea how many sets of batteries ive used up or the number of vibrators ive worn out i bought a couple of dildos while you were gone i even tried cucumbers and zucchini but none of them satisfied me as well as that few minutes just now

3963608 ive been spending some time on the internet chatting with other wives and girlfriends of servicemen overseas you wouldnt believe how raunchy some of those girls can be its scandalous but it got me wet as hell talking with them i got some good advice and there were some suggestions id like to try i think youll like it
3963609 remember i told you id been speaking to other army wives while you were gone
3963610 you wanna know what some of them like to do
3963611 close your eyes and put your hands together then put them over your head
3963612 hush youre okay just trust me keep your eyes closed
3963613 this is something else i learned from some of those army wives just relax and go with it
3963614 not yet theres one more biggie that i want to try close your eyes again
3963615 ive been practicing for months i found a dildo that was about your size and have been working with it little by little you cant imagine how good this feels
3963616 maybe not but you have no idea how good it feels for me either or looks for that matter
3963617 i still dont really understand why im tied up though
3963618 you my sexy boy are tied up so that i can take this at my own pace if you were free youd want to take over but until im used to this i cant have that if this works out right i think well both want to do this again but if its no good for me this is it
3963619 okay ill shut up about being tied take your time im in no rush this feels too damn good for it to end too soon
3963620 you can sure say that again so is that the only time well be doing that
3963621 oh no thats a repeater for sure i dont know if its going to be a regular thing but its definitely something you can look forward to on occasion

3963625 tell aaron and his sons to treat with respect the sacred offerings the israelites consecrate to me so they will not profane my holy name i am the lord
3963626 say to them for the generations to come if any of your descendants is ceremonially unclean and yet comes near the sacred offerings that the israelites consecrate to the lord that person must be cut off from my presence i am the lord
3963627 if a descendant of aaron has an infectious skin disease or a bodily discharge he may not eat the sacred offerings until he is cleansed he will also be unclean if he touches something defiled by a corpse or by anyone who has an emission of semen
3963628 the priests are to keep my requirements so that they do not become guilty and die for treating them with contempt i am the lord who makes them holy
3963629 no one outside a priests family may eat the sacred offering nor may the guest of a priest or his hired worker eat it
3963630 if anyone eats a sacred offering by mistake he must make restitution to the priest for the offering and add a fifth of the value to it
3963631 speak to aaron and his sons and to all the israelites and say to them if any of you either an israelite or an alien living in israel presents a gift for a burnt offering to the lord either to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering
3963632 when a calf a lamb or a goat is born it is to remain with its mother for seven days from the eighth day on it will be acceptable as an offering made to the lord by fire
3963633 when you sacrifice a thank offering to the lord sacrifice it in such a way that it will be accepted on your behalf
3963634 keep my commands and follow them i am the lord
3963635 players are being very cautious and expect the european data to show further weakening so it will be difficult for the euro to gain in the near term

3963646 a fairly heated debate over whether the ad is racist
3963647 they will be under strict orders not to fire on southbound aliens
3963648 i really think it has to be a consensus with other agencies
3963649 the general public they felt less comfortable than they usually do on our roads they felt a little less safe but not unacceptably so in our view
3963650 i falled in and i get stuck and i scared and then mommy and daddy and sissy and grammy and pops and grandma d and miss shenelle and miss tammy and miss sheila and miss amanda save me you pull and you pull and you puuuuulllllll and you pull me out

3963654 oh ok i was just wondering if you had a few crowns you could spare for a fellow traveler
3963655 this story about jolie taking over is completely false this started with an inaccurate report months ago that said cruise was taking the role
3963656 they courted him for almost a year for this movie he considered it but passed
3963657 hes been offered many roles in the past few months were sure to see news about the next project soon
3963658 i got a call from someone very very close to jen over the weekend asking if i knew anyone who might want to go out on a date with her
3963659 they werent being very discreet about it the news hadnt even broken yet that she and john split youd think of all people jen aniston wouldnt need to use people in her camp as a dating service
3963660 she has been focusing so much on her career and business there hasnt been time to spend a lot of money
3963661 hes thinking in the 8 million to 10 million range
3963662 but it depends on how the movie opens and how desperately they want him back
3963663 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years
3963664 they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
3963665 casey had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop
3963666 even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally
3963667 i see him all the time at least once a week
3963668 the adoption is now advanced all the government is waiting for is madonna to forward the petition of adoption formalities then mercy will be able to leave the country for a new life
3963669 twice i have told the adoption people that i do not want mercy to go outside the country
3963670 i think thats an event i can do well in
3963671 send them all a pre printed picture of me and stamp my autograph on it im done
3963672 sometimes it can really scare people to get what they want she then references a book called
3963673 one person who appears to have benefitted from the fight between shah rukh and salman is farah khans husband shirish kunder he has become a regular visitor to galaxy apartments hes been visiting a lot these days and stays there till late night
3963674 their problems are now in the past while shirish is waiting for his acting career to take off his priority is directing films he doesnt want to be anybodys friend but just focus on his work
3963675 yes we are meeting often we are working on a film together but i cant talk about it however i would like to clarify that its not true that salman and i ever had any problems while working with each other
3963676 the film is not joker its salmans idea and he wants shirish to direct it the talks began when they bumped into each other at an event and connected the film will be a james bond like stylish action thriller with hollywood technicians its being made on a very huge scale and salman might even produce it
3963677 saif also met stallone on the sets and got along like a house on fire
3963678 yes while saif has my name on his forearm stallone has his wife jennifer flavins face tattooed on his arm and the holly actor told saif to do the same with my photo on his arm
3963679 i told saif no way its very painful and its enough he has my name on his forearm
3963680 saif is against tattoos on women even i think women shouldnt they should be pure and clean

3963756 the us housing market is continuing to deteriorate after a string of figures today showed a larger than expected drop in the sales of new homes along with a fall in the prices of existing homes
3963757 through this decade and right up to 2020 i want us in environmentally friendly ways using principally brownfield land and building eco towns and villages to meet housing need by building over a quarter of a million more homes than previously planned a total by 2020 of 3 million new homes for families across the country so for england we will raise the annual house building target for 2016 from 200 000 to 240 000 new homes a year

3963811 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
3963812 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
3963813 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
3963814 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
3963815 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
3963816 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
3963817 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
3963818 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
3963819 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
3963820 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

3963837 the patient should have come back to me if she had any problem
3963838 the day after the wash up the doctor came for a check up and he told us that the patient would be discharged we were not told that some cotton wool had been left behind and that it had to be removed
3963839 our company is poised to be a part of the 126 billion pain management industry our goal has been to have 100 or more biotech l3aser tm centers operating nationwide similar to the 80 lasik plus eye vision centers currently operating today the strategic franchise alliance we are negotiating will put biotech on fast track to accomplish or exceed our goals

3963842 a cyber warfare campaign by russia is seriously disrupting many georgian websites including that of the ministry of foreign affairs
3963843 conventionally they are normally adept at trying to hide their true origins for such a siege on the scale of this one they are openly showing more of their routing than they would like to which will assist us now and in the future in this case it helped pin point some obviously forged web sites which are now offline and assist in rerouting good lessons for future cyber wars
3963844 many outlets are claiming that the russian government is behind the attacks but no one seems to have any proof
3963845 unfortunately we have no proof either and we have no proof to the contrary what i can say without a doubt is that only the perpetrators know for sure who is behind it
3963846 we have seen many different ddos attacks from these particular c amp c servers but there doesnt seem to be any rhyme or reason to it
3963847 not every fighting is warfare while georgia is obviously under a ddos attacks and it is political in nature it doesnt so far seem different than any other online after math by fans political tensions are always followed by online attacks by sympathizer
3963848 could this somehow be indirect russian action yes but considering russia is past playing nice and uses real bombs they could have attacked more strategic targets or eliminated the infrastructure kinetically
3963849 not only a strong chairman of but also a cherished friend and confidant
3963850 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3963851 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3963852 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3963853 this decision was made as part of an ongoing strategic review of our portfolio and enables us to maintain our strong and stable financial performance by further paying down debt
3963854 we will continue to own and operate industry leading companies invest in existing businesses and maintain a level of financial discipline that ensures we are well positioned for ongoing success
3963855 a fine of 37 000 is not going to make a big dent in their profit margin
3963856 in a situation where we believe their continued non compliance and the impact on the environment is sufficiently severe we will take action
3963857 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
3963858 this senseless tragedy comes as a shock to all of us
3963859 our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family
3963860 thats something that well be looking into right now we dont have an answer for you on that
3963861 most certainly i want to dispose of this sham and i intend to do so
3963862 when i made those allegations i was in the national party and outside of it after that and i was making them with knowledge it never happened with my party
3963863 and whether it shows through depends on how much force was put into it
3963864 one of the concerns of the taskforce is that we havent been able to see enough of lets say the implementation of the security forces

3963877 one of my interests is virtual reality and i want to heed the governments call for more serious involvement in the biomedical sector i feel engineers from various fields can contribute to biotechnology
3963878 unimaps dean of the school of engineering and the research unit the deputy vice chancellor of research and innovation and the vice chancellor himself have always supported my work this victory is as much theirs as it is mine

3963886 thank you you have been a stalwart youve done an awesome job you have educated so many people
3963887 ultimately we must change the way our votes are being counted or not counted and dave is one of those individuals who is making this a reality

3963890 dave berman has been candid and confrontational in challenging all of us to be
3963891 dave bermans work is quietly brilliant and powerfully utilitarian his voter confidence resolution provides a fine flexible tool whereby any community can reclaim and affirm a right relation to its franchise as a community of voters
3963892 whats special about this book and it fits because theres nothing more fundamental to democracy than our vote is the raising of consciousness someone recognizing they have no basis for trusting elections may well ask what else is being taken for granted
3963893 this implies that the greatest amount of western console developers by sheer numbers are creating games for microsofts console but due to team size differences this doesnt necessarily imply that more games will appear on the xbox 360 than other consoles
3963894 overall the playstation 3 outputs visuals that are either on par with the xbox 360 or only slightly behind
3963895 my impressions is the city doesnt do very much for pedestrians in construction zones
3963896 its not a set standard what im hoping for is a change in public policy
3963897 excellent its really a huge problem itll probably get worse before it gets better so we need to come up with a plan for the more vulnerable population walking out there
3963898 we think that some measurable improvements can be made by better inspecting construction areas and better enforcing existing rules
3963899 and there are few exceptions for when construction physically cannot be completed otherwise
3963900 as much as practical the desired characteristics of the existing pedestrian facilities

3963912 he adds a lot of energy there and in the physical side of things he is always in amongst it
3963913 how effective you are depends on whether you get front foot ball or not i know certainly when you dont have front foot ball he can be a real menace

3963915 for me south africa is bigger than australia just because of the history and the controversies as well
3963916 also the 1995 world cup final was a game i remember i was young kid and i didnt enjoy the result ive always been determined about playing against south africa
3963917 having played super 14 here does help and its not a case of jumping into the unknown
3963918 but ive heard from the other boys about how dauting it is to come to africa in the black jersey about how african players at home grow another arm and leg were certainly expecting them to fire up against us
3963919 we know we can do it but we have phases in games where we have lapses in concentration
3963920 if we focus on executing the set pieces as good as we can we should be good its just the mental application the boys need to go into the game with

3963932 its obviously nice to beat a team that is so close to us in the wild card race so to be able to go and take two out of three from the yankees and kind of put them in a little more of a hole and separate us from those guys is nice
3963933 but we know how important every game is every series so its going to be this way from here on out

3964017 what oakland hills is doing because the green complexes are so challenging is putting the driver in their hands because they have to get as close to the green as they can to access the hole location
3964018 they know if they lay up off the tee and they have a 40 foot putt there is a good chance they are going to three putt its putting a little more pressure on them off the tee the fairways are probably averaging 25 or 26 yards wide for the ryder cup in 2004 they averaged 32 yards wide theyre trying to reward accuracy and take away the bombers advantage
3964019 the greens were 11 to 12 on the stimpmeter in the morning they were actually slower than they were in the 2004 ryder cup the winds and the dry air are what affected them we syringed the greens and put a little bit of water on and the aim was to make the course play similar both days as it always is you dont want to go too far the other way watering the greens its always a bit of a dicey game once everyone has had a morning and afternoon tee time you can make an adjustment which is more reasonable and fair than between thursday and friday

3964129 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
3964130 it has the impact of saying to russia enough is enough
3964131 it is time for everybody to calm down and start the political process
3964132 places americans as a distinct party to the circumstances in georgia
3964133 future russian action after we become present could endanger americans and that can be seen as a trip wire for further us action
3964134 it is not the intention of the united states in some way to take control of facilities port facilities or the like
3964135 thats way premature and hypothetical and speculative and nothing that i would comment on
3964136 well beyond the bounds of the conflict in south ossetia
3964137 russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3964138 only marginally favorable for development and the potential for tropical cyclone formation during the next day or two has decreased
3964139 ah one of lawrence sanders archy mcnally books i havent read
3964140 morgans 25th century earth is convincing while the questions he poses about how much self is tied to body chemistry and how the rich believe themselves above the law are especially timely
3964141 a poster child of the extremist elitist gun control movement
3964142 to somehow suggest obama is supportive of gun owners because he says so when he is in montana running for president is absurd
3964143 we are going to make sure that anybody that tells montana gun owners that barack obama is not a threat to gun owners is exposed as someone who is not shooting straight
3964144 the nra is wrong to suggest we are misleading anybody
3964145 oh i just hate it when young people get all those tattoos
3964146 well like that couple over there they have tattoos all down their arms i just hate that it just looks so bad i just think god created us beautiful as we are and people are taking away from what god gave us by getting these tattoos
3964147 the weakening korean won continues to trigger additional air cargo demand from korean exporters
3964148 there are not that many factors that can drive prices higher
3964149 the conflict in georgia does not have that much impact the pipeline was already offline
3964150 if youre not spending your money finding and developing new oil then theres no new oil
3964151 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
3964152 peshmerga will stay in diyala until there is a baghdad irbil political solution
3964153 this is a secure area and is not in need of the iraqi forces coming in nor is it in need of a military operation our forces were deployed in this area by a request from the american forces and the iraqi forces with the aim of protecting kurdish residents shia and sunni from terrorist attacks
3964154 i had just started coaching a new team out of binghamton at that point and i remember the moment i met edna quite well
3964155 she bent my ear for the better part of two hours after that meet and i eventually relented and agreed to see what she could do in the water ive never seen such raw talent before particularly in someone so young it was simply amazing
3964156 people dont realize how huge synchronized swimming really is its like curling or rodeo just wildly popular but the press never covers it so people assume its just an olympic oddity
3964157 when your head is underwater though and you can still hear the thunderous cheers of the crowds you know this is no oddity
3964158 edna was at the top of her swim and coming home to the hometown crowd at the aquatic center to compete for a chance to go to the olympics well it was just a perfect time
3964159 it made the disappointment all the more difficult to bear
3964160 the girls were going through their routine chopins ocean etude opus 25 no 12 struggling to rise above the cheering crowd when all of a sudden the pool started turning a bright bright red
3964161 i know its crazy but my first thought was shark attack how can we work it into the routine but nope it was just edna executing a flawless spin and pissing in the pool
3964162 it was horrible everyone started calling me redna and no one wanted to swim with me
3964163 i eventually had to quit people can be so cruel but im moving on

3964175 people have realized that the complete removal of the feminine element from the christian message is a shortcoming from an anthropological viewpoint it is theologically and anthropologically important for woman to be at the center of christianity

3964180 goes to 11 again so i thought id send it in
3964181 the russians just shot down the government command nets so they could cover their incursion
3964182 this was really one of the first aspects of a coordinated military action that had cyber as a lead force instead of sending in air planes we need to figure out a way not only see the attack coming but to block it and in blocking it chase it home
3964183 i think this is a very poor time to send a signal that the united states is not interested in focusing on warfighting in the cyber domain
3964184 but whenever i think him of him i just laugh
3964185 we heard the story being put out in the press but it didnt look good
3964186 he loved music and after filming on a friday night hed arrange for a dj and bar
3964187 hed smoke one of his cigars and wed party until two three in the morning
3964188 he was a larger than life figure and one of the most loyal people i knew
3964189 i met bernie through a friend who was the original music supervisor on the pilot episode we had the same taste in music and hit it off right away it was a great working relationship he would give you his ideas and then let you get on with it
3964190 he was stealing scenes right from the beginning of his career bernie leaves a great comic legacy and he will be sorely missed
3964191 7 fast ways to get great links to your website
3964192 sometimes when i think of it it sounds personal it sounds maybe like there are some levels of jealousy and envy there and again when youre dealing with a disenfranchised community and fragmented and abused community i dont know
3964193 as a person kevin is one of the most humble god fearing family loving generous and active people i can say that about him with such conviction because thats who he is and you have to know him anybody who knows him will corroborate that
3964194 i dont know anything to be fact and whats unfortunate in my opinion is that with the judicial system we have a person is supposed to be innocent until proven guilty but unfortunately it works in the reverse youre presumed guilty and have to prove yourself innocent
3964195 the first case charges one count of sexual battery by fraud one count of attempted sexual battery by fraud one felony count of sexual exploitation by a physician and two misdemeanor counts of sexual exploitation by a physician and then two misdemeanor counts of sexual battery
3964196 occurred at a separate medical facility where he also worked and with respect to one of the victims the forcible rape is alleged to have taken place at her home
3964197 its very disappointing to see the tactics of a prosecution team that advertises for victims and that doesnt do a thorough investigation before making these kind of serious allegations
3964198 we are going to vigorously defend dr browns innocence as to each of these claims
3964199 there is an indication that several people said something at the time whether it be to someone that worked there or to a friend or family member
3964200 its not like everybody for the first time after seeing it on the news told people for the first time
3964201 i thought it was almost like an ambush because i dont think he ever really once listened to the facts of the case or the bail issues
3964202 i thought his mind was already made up because they used all those things against us
3964203 we intend to fight this case vigorously once the case is fought in court were sure that it will work out and all the truth about the case will come out
3964204 each charge carries a scheduled bail amount so first of all you have a lot more charges in the second case than you do the first but there was a bail deviation and that was based upon a judge making a decision on the bail based on two things if theres a risk that theyre going to flee if they have contacts in other countries or the ability to leave and secondly if they pose a danger to the community and commissioner hall upheld the amount of bail at the arraignment and he actually made some record of that in court saying that he found that he was a flight risk and that he did pose a risk to the community based on the allegations
3964205 painted a picture of a man that i have known for a very long time i know him better than i know myself i know what he will do and what he wont do and ive been in just about every possible situation with this guy so i know how he will respond to certain situations and for them to mention rape and drugs and molestation and all of those other things that is not of his moral fiber he is a man of divine character high integrity
3964206 our records show that between 2 to 6 years is a danger period that is 2 to 6 years on the job
3964207 i think the danger period is when youre younger and you dont have the experience with age comes some wisdom with thinking about things but im much better than i was at 21 as far as the way i think and the thought i put into it
3964208 younger officers we have right now may have a lack of experience might need more training those are some of the things we are looking at right now
3964209 what weve seen recently is that there are a lot of new cops out there there are 2 000 in the last two years so you have cops out there that only have a year or a year and a half on the streets
3964210 they actually used the word danger so if these officers are a danger theyre going to be a danger to us to our community
3964211 there needs to be a policy or something put in place to have these younger officers maybe ride with a lieutenant or a sergeant or someone more experienced because these are the aggressive officers with a cowboy instinct wanting to make a name for themselves and are very aggressive on the young people
3964212 we have pretty much covered deadly shooting when to use our weapon what weapon to use in different scenarios weve covered pretty much most of the laws the basic laws we would see every day
3964213 the first month they usually start by going over our deadly force policy they actually push that most when to use our guns when not to use our guns what other options we can use instead of using our guns pretty much how to justify the reason why we shot if we do ever get into a shooting situation they actually push that on us the most we hear that throughout the whole academy they also push us to use other options like the taser or the baton
3964214 i know who i am im the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude
3964215 its kinda like when you go to an animal shelter and you get an abused animal
3964216 you know the animal was beat up and mistreated by somebody then you give them a good home and if you ask that dog right then and there what was it like theyre like what do you mean im so happy and just glad to be here
3964217 yeah there was that concern but i couldnt be in fear of it
3964218 i remember when i did the iron man press tour an afghan reporter stood up and said i was putting down his country then i stood up to answer him and thought here i am throwing down with a complete stranger because he thinks i offended him
3964219 in tropic the conceit of the movie is that hes a complete idiot and that gives us permission to break down the stereotypes it also shows how far weve come
3964220 people who are high minded enough to not be racist or offensive
3964221 i could regale you with how brutal and exhausting it was and what a trooper i am for having allowed them to pay me to be in this great movie and shoot it in hawaii the whole idea of actors taking themselves seriously is the funniest thing in reality
3964222 it was very important for me that the actor playing kirk lazarus was one of the most respected actors of his generation
3964223 he got so into it and was so clear about what his intention was as the character that his confidence is what makes the audience feel okay with it they buy it as a natural thing where this guy is coming from the right place
3964224 it was also important for the set up of the movie that brandons character was always there calling him out on this stuff
3964225 initially i got really mad i mean a year ago i was just thinking about myself i had just finished iron man and then ben stillers gonna call me up and say i wanna do this great big movie with you but i want you to have the highest risk factor and maybe put you up to ridicule and have people hate you i was like wait a minute what happened to just being an actor for hire
3964226 they had 30 days to comply with the elements of the agreement there were certain elements associated with that agreement
3964227 it has been 30 days that we notified the developer not actually the date of the ruling but 30 days since we notified the developer that items were needed within 30 days otherwise the city would move forward
3964228 i was uncomfortable in terms of having a conversation with him based on the last directions given to me from the redevelopment agency
3964229 its like this huge amount of pressure has been lifted off my shoulders
3964230 its like this huge dark cloud is finally gone and the sunshine in lynwood is back
3964231 what people who think weve been against this because we dont want that need to understand is that this contract never made sense from the beginning it was just a big scam in my opinion
3964232 there are certain areas where we must be mindful of the employees rights
3964233 this is a serious issue and it would have been totally inappropropriate of me to be seen laughing about it
3964234 i have an obligation to listen to the concerns of the community and i was not overwhelmed by their criticism at the city council meeting i dont think that trust in the police department has been compromised to the degree that one would believe
3964235 major operations against the avenues gang and the cypress park gang
3964236 my staff is doing all the work because your expletive staff is lazy and incompetent and isnt doing a expletive thing to get you elected
3964237 expletive with me and mine and ill expletive walk away
3964238 there is not a more committed public servant and talented leader that i know of than sen mark ridley thomas we need his demonstrated leadership on the l a county board of supervisors
3964239 i think that while staff recommendation is opposed to this payment you should know that youre within your rights to make this payment
3964240 all of the actions with which mr sanchez was charged were taken within the course and scope of mr sanchezs employment they were taken in good faith and they were taken on the advice of the then city manager and the city attorney
3964241 the one issue i hope you will consider is that someday down the line you will be taking an action that is recommended by the city manager by the city attorney and in good faith all seven of you may agree that that action is legal and ethical and some day down the line a deputy district attorney may decide that he or she wants to prosecute you
3964242 i could speak from experience and i could speak for mr sanchez that it does not take much for the district attorney to file felony charges it turns your life upside down it turns your finances upside down and it kills your reputation and there is nowhere to go to get your reputation back once those charges have been dismissed
3964243 that way we can make a more educated decision because i do have a concern
3964244 i trust everything that my city manager and everything that my city attorney tell me if five years from now someone wants to tell me the advice was not legit now are you not going to defend me when i was acting in the capacity of a council member i have a real concern with that
3964245 what is before you is whether or not the city should pay for their legal bills and defense
3964246 we are not making any decision at all as to whether they had any criminal liability or ultimately their actions were or were not criminal
3964247 not have an obligation to pay the legal fees period
3964248 you dont have to make a decision tonight but delaying the decision just means that the city will not be responding to the claim on time
3964249 they had the decision to have these meetings they had the power to dictate their salary it was an abuse of their power
3964250 is it in the scope of their work not in my book
3964251 mr rodriguezs ongoing ignorance of criminal law parallels his ignorance of municipal law
3964252 his conduct toward others his past and present reckless conduct toward others and reckless statements and opinions towards others
3964253 it is very unfortunate that it is necessary for this to become a court matter
3964254 not only for the city where the city is going to have to deal with the cost and responsibility and financial obligation to respond to the complaint which will ultimately cost the city well over the requested amount
3964255 i dont have to do any more terrorist attacks because the american leadership is achieving my goals of destroying america through endless war economic collapse and the arrogance of empire
3964256 you want to keep living well compared to the rest of the world well we consume nearly a quarter of the worlds petroleum but are just a small percentage of population so you may not want to know how i do it or what i do but im going to grab that oil it may not be pretty and there will be collateral damage but only the wusses on capitol hill and the whining liberals care about that this is a tough world and you got to do what needs to be done if you want to keep living high off the hog so you keep on doing what youre doing ill handle the german shepherds and the renditions and the torture and the wars and the anthrax because im not going to let any obstructionists or weak kneed legislators get in my way this is whats best for america i know and ill operate the way i do it best in secrecy and in the shadows
3964257 it is a travesty here is a volunteer program that runs extremely cost effectively and its improving indigenous health and for no good reason i can think of this program is being cut
3964258 it should not be permitted to leave a medical centre empty when there is a demonstrated need for it

3964263 there is no appropriate public transport to get young people to places where other teenagers hang out like going to the cinemas or if they want to go to casuarina to hang out with their mates
3964264 we want to raise the profile so that they do get the resouces that they need the department has really been slimmed down in the research area for primary industries and fisheries
3964265 a lot of a major roads or lets call them the highways they are sort of getting to the end of their economical useful life and there is no priority as to which ones should get fixed
3964266 yet government is quite keen to promote kakadu as the region for tourism and all sorts of other things and yet getting to the region is obviously problematic
3964267 i dont think thats in the communitys best interest if someone like us does that certainly things that are in and around our resort we would assist in doing but thats why we all pay taxes
3964268 paul henderson will be a wonderful chief minister over time

3964295 bill gwatney was our friend our partys leader and so many times our partys conscience our state and our party are better for all that bill gwatney has done
3964296 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney along with thousands of other arkansans ginger and i are trying to come to terms such a shocking and senseless attack we ask all arkansans to keep the gwatney family in your thoughts and prayers
3964297 it is indeed a tragedy not just for the city but for the entire state of arkansas on the loss of bill gwatney
3964298 as a colleague a friend i dont know anyone i have greater respect for
3964299 whatever he told you you could take as the truth
3964300 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him our prayers are with his family during this time
3964301 he has been a close and valued friend to me and i am devastated that this senseless act has taken him from us
3964302 for sure congratulations to everybody in here working hard this is a beautiful course i can say so far its my favourite place on tour i love that its old and its very traditional the greens are going to be a challenge with different levels the grass is quick
3964303 i really like the setup too i dont think there are going to be many low rounds i think you know for sure its going to be under par but i dont think 15 or 18 or 17 under par so i think thats a good challenge for all us
3964304 on the back nine no 10 and no 18 if you have the driver you can reach the green in two so thats an advantage
3964305 what im trying to do is take advantage of that little extra distance and give myself a few eagle chances
3964306 uh huh i think its an advantage you know thats one of my priorities i always work hard in the off season to get a little more distance im light but im strong i think i have strong legs i do a lot of exercise i have quick turn that helps me to create speed
3964307 i was ready a few weeks ago yeah i mean im doing okay
3964308 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3964309 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3964310 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3964311 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3964312 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3964313 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3964314 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3964315 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3964316 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3964317 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3964318 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3964319 with that in mind lets cover some general expectations that will give you a flavor of bju
3964320 kami harus memproduksi beberapa type compund berbeda untk beradaptasi dengan permukaan sirkuit yang baru yang mana kurang nge grip dibanding sebelumnya
3964321 kami harus menyesuaikan komposisi ban kami dengan permukaan baru ini yang mana kami harapkan bisa dimaksimalkan tim dan pembalap kami untuk sesi latihan jumat 15 8 200 nanti
3964322 trek ini sangat agresif di bagian ban depan tapi tidak di bagian belakang kami akan membawa compound baru untuk brno tapi kami masih harus melihat keinginan pembalap kami
3964323 saya menyukai brno saya pernah menang ketika masih berkompetisi di kelas 125 dan 250 tahun ini panitia memang telah memperbaiki sirkuit brno jadi itu akan menjadi faktor baru buat semua orang
3964324 saya memiliki masa rehat yang cukup baik saya menghabiskan waktu di montecarlo dan kembali ke romagna pasalnya saya sudah tidak melihat keluarga cukup lama
3964325 subaru always has been and will continue to be committed to safeguarding the natural environment that so many of our customers avidly enjoy we will continue to make environmental technologies a priority in our product development manufacturing and business process
3964326 in a civilized society abuse by those who are given great authority cannot be tolerated
3964327 it now comes time for us to be able to present our side of the story
3964328 we pray that it will not become a spectacle comparable to what took place in jena
3964329 is it an explosive situation that can create a backlash sure but thats not what i see
3964330 its not just blacks being abused its whites being abused too
3964331 we have decided to assign an initial 2 million to each member country for the joint purchase of fertilizer for the most urgent needs of the coming planting season
3964332 president chavezs initiative to provide these funds provides us with some tranquility and a way we can together tackle the great challenges poor countries face such as higher prices
3964333 suspenda la aplicaci n de estos decretos leyes hasta que producto de ejercicio democr tico participativo se consulte los ciudadanos a los sectores representativos de la vida nacional
3964334 se llegue a conclusiones sobre la constitucionalidad y conveniencia de dichos instrumentos jur dicos
3964335 la violaci n de la participaci n ciudadana y la voluntad popular
3964336 nos estaremos preparando para una vez culminadas las vacaciones judiciales el 15 de septiembre introducir ante el tribunal supremo de justicia aquellos recursos que consideremos necesarios
3964337 este es mi regalo para fidel debe llegarle ma ana el mejor retrato de bol var en mi modesto criterio que he visto toda mi vida

3964343 ellos me dijeron que la disip hab a enviado dos millones un mill n que me lo dar an a mi y quedaron en que doblar an esa cantidad dice abad seg n la transcripci n del di logo
3964344 la instrucci n que recibimos es que de ninguna manera deb amos volver con un triunfo de los agropecuarios y con una derrota de los industriales
3964345 error your shows must be greater than the number of ribbons
3964346 a poster child of the extremist elitist gun control movement
3964347 to somehow suggest obama is supportive of gun owners because he says so when he is in montana running for president is absurd
3964348 we are going to make sure that anybody that tells montana gun owners that barack obama is not a threat to gun owners is exposed as someone who is not shooting straight
3964349 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
3964350 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3964351 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3964352 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3964353 it does sound a bit like a hollywood action movie if id been an hour later i wouldnt have got them it was that close
3964354 the promoter fucked up getting the necessary work visas and flights
3964355 divine heresy would like to send our sincerest apologies to all of our south american fans please do not let this reflect negatively on the band and as soon as we find a new promoter we will come back down there and tear it up
3964356 so back in june we decided to demo some new songs with our buddy
3964357 we are going to finish up all our currently scheduled dates and get into writing mode again only this time things are different the last year as been rough on us ruiners and left us with a healthy dose of inspiration to fuel some of the most aggressive music we have ever writen
3964358 so thats about it for now well have more news on the new album soon and cant wait to get back out on the road fuck we havent even left yet
3964359 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3964360 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3964361 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3964362 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3964363 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3964364 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3964365 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3964366 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3964367 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3964368 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3964369 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3964370 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3964371 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3964372 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3964373 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3964374 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3964375 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3964376 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3964377 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3964378 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3964379 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3964380 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3964381 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3964382 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3964383 it just feels natural like its basically my other home
3964384 i watch his turns i watch his style i watch his stroke rate i watch how he does his turns his strategy during the race just everything and then i try to take those things and teach our swimmers how to do those
3964385 to be able to coach an olympian that would be so beyond my wildest dreams that i cant even put it into words
3964386 its inspiring because you know what can be done and then you have a goal to go after
3964387 its fortunate to have kids like mike because hes fun he likes to put in what he puts in and he helps inspire some of the other swimmers
3964388 many people know chris jericho as a wwe legend but he is also a musician and the lead singer of his own band fozzy
3964389 chris is someone who has worked hard to get to where he is today and that experience makes him a valuable resource and mentor for these women vying for a chance at stardom
3964390 if current trends continue we are likely to see the pass rate nudge over 97 this year
3964391 in terms of a grades in 2002 it was 20 7 and in 2007 it was 25 3
3964392 that means it has risen by just short of 5 in six years should that continue it will mean more than 26 will get a grades this year
3964393 its basically a bike on steroids in a good way
3964394 in a test on a flat road though the bike was much easier to ride than expected
3964395 mapped in relation to the original recordings by the band
3964396 airport express base station wireless router plugs into the wall near your stereo connects to your stereo through a simple 1 8 inch stereo connection and allows you to stream music straight from itunes
3964397 yes and if you embrace this kingdom life and dont doubt god youll not only do minor feats like i did to the fig tree but also triumph over huge obstacles
3964398 for eon visa electron and ewallet card holders please contact the unionbank customer service call center at 84 186 and ask the customer service agent to provide you with the 4 digit paypal expanded use code
3964399 the national telecommunications and information administration an agency of the department of commerce is the show stopper here
3964400 theyre the only department of the government that isnt on board with securing the domain name system and unfortunately theyre also the ones who commerce deputized to oversee icann
3964401 the biggest difference is that once the root is signed and the public key is out it will be put in every operating system and will be on all cds from apple microsoft suse freebsd etc
3964402 the only one you have to have to go down the tree
3964403 a few years ago there were still technical hurdles to actually signing and using dnssec but in the past few years a lot of software tools both commercial and open source have come out and now its a completely solved problem
3964404 all thats left is the far less tractable purely political problem
3964405 arguing over who gets to hold the cryptographic keys in the long run should wait until were not facing a critical threat
3964406 we are committed to taking no action that would have the potential to adversely affect the operational stability of the dns
3964407 while there is increasing pressure to secure the dns ntia must work with all stakeholders and consider all possible solutions
3964408 currently dnssec is the only mechanism known to protect against the kaminsky attack
3964409 it is not clear that other solutions will provide the same level of protection as dnssec
3964410 then the issue becomes political because there seems to be the perception that the introduction of a key guardian changes the current policies
3964411 we would want to bring the editing creation and signing of the root zone file here
3964412 its way too early to know which if any of these technologies is going to be practical
3964413 but its important for us to get ahead of the curve soldiers are always on the cutting edge of new technologies
3964414 in situations where it is important to win the hearts and minds of the local populace it would be useful to know if they understand the information being given them
3964415 its also important to develop antidotes and protective agents against various classes of drugs
3964416 how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands
3964417 i think most reasonable people if they imagine a world in which all sides have figured out how to control brains theyd rather not go there
3964418 most rational human beings would believe that if we could have a world where nobody does military neuroscience well all be better off but for some people in the pentagon its too delicious to ignore
3964419 if we can alter the brain why not control it one potential use involves making soldiers want to fight
3964420 have the dod scientists and contractors been field testing their present accomplishments along these lines already on whom
3964421 what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain
3964422 the question should be asked now that what has long been alleged has been stated openly is
3964423 you have to look at things like the development perspective and what this all means for developers and how this changes the game
3964424 weve provided competition in a market that desperately needed competition
3964425 from a silverlight perspective this is an amazing opportunity to demonstrate whats possible with the technology this puts a stake in the ground and is saying were here this may be the single biggest online event and microsoft is empowering it
3964426 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
3964427 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
3964428 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
3964429 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
3964430 we know that the russian government controls those servers theoretically if they have not been pwned by somebody else
3964431 i can only say i see a strong correlation with the types and patterns of activity of ddos and the strong very suspicious timing of the attacks its either one of the most coincidental mass cyber attacks ive ever seen or theres been some sort of cooperation on some level
3964432 while cyber war seems to be the current buzzword and is overblown over certain incidents the risk of information warfare is real as has been seen before in targeted attacks for espionage purposes and in the devastating infrastructure attack against estonia
3964433 constitution says kurdish peshmerga forces should remain only within the border of kurdistan region therefore khanqin and the other areas belong to diyala province should come under the control of the iraqi forces
3964434 iraqi forces have imposed blockade on peshmerga bases west of jalaula the problem still exists between the iraqi army and peshmerga and the siege has not been lifted yet

3964446 theres no water theres no electricity at this place and people are more or less squatting here
3964447 having the manpower to actually go out and look for them and find them that has made a big difference in getting them off the street quickly
3964448 we can always use more resources and certainly this isnt more than what we expected we knew what we were up against when we got started and thats why we applied for the grants to begin with
3964449 nowadays people are afraid theyre so afraid to just do anything but the thing of it is thank god the police force we have is doing their job

3964459 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
3964460 the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
3964461 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this

3964465 the results point to a need for physicians who are treating older adults experiencing sexual problems to take into account their physical health and also consider their mental health and their satisfaction with their intimate relationship in making any assessment

3964471 you can look at it two ways im going to struggle to see everybody else but theyre going to struggle to see me
3964472 hopefully i can get a slip on the field and they wont know what i am up to obviously if you can get a big lead it is an advantage but if you are fighting it out in the finish you might not be in touch with what everyone else is up to
3964473 it depends who i draw next to hopefully i draw one of the quick guys out of the blocks like alan campbell or olaf tufte so if i can jump on the bandwagon then it might not to be too bad
3964474 if i can race like i did today and im a 100 per cent then i dont think i have to worry too much about the others
3964475 it didnt feel bad but it also didnt feel like our quickest race
3964476 i was always aware coming into this regatta that the standard was going be high everyone is going to lift up there level for these races and semifinal time is no different
3964477 i wont say im disappointed im fairly neutral about the result but obviously wed like to go quicker were going to have to
3964478 quality infrastructure is vital to lifting national productivity improving public services and generating long term economic growth
3964479 new zealand has fantastic renewable resources like hydro and wind and its important that we develop those but the lesson from this winter is that thermal electricity generation is essential in keeping the lights on
3964480 at times this winter thermal electricity was providing more than 50 of new zealands power needs
3964481 the reality is new zealand relies on gas for security of electricity supply gas plants like the highly efficient e3p plant at huntly can run around the clock if the wind stops blowing and the water stops flowing gas just keeps going

3964505 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
3964506 i think hes undisputedly the greatest swimmer of all time
3964507 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
3964508 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
3964509 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3964510 he was saying to me i think ive figured out
3964511 he is not from another planet he is from the future
3964512 youve only got to be an employer and have two of your staff in the position that ours are to just have to endorse any procedures that are likely to prevent something like that from happening ever again so theyve just got to be realistic about it all
3964513 they need to be accountable and im going to make them accountable one way or another
3964514 based on medical advice that it was too big a risk for people that would be looking after the horse
3964515 the appropriate role for the federal government is to move as quickly as it can to put in place the new industrial legislation and to urge all parties including telstra to live in the real world to recognise the fact that circumstances have changed and to act in good faith
3964516 telstra has not acted in an honest way they have sought to camouflage their intentions here
3964517 we want work choices to be got rid of as soon as possible
3964518 but we also understand that the federal government has a complex task in dismantling work choices in putting in place a whole new industrial system it is a difficult task
3964519 all we are asking is telstra to be open with us and its employees and put its cards on the table
3964520 of course we looked at the companys options if union negotiations broke down and they did
3964521 of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia
3964522 let me make this very clear that any collective agreement would have nothing to do with awas or work choices and our employees would get to vote on it
3964523 first off let me say hello and welcome to the world of mystery science theater 3000 fandom
3964524 i understand that the first time you see the show it seems so brilliantly original so weird and whimsical so different from nearly everything else youve seen that the temptation is to tell all your friends about it
3964525 however the very next temptation after that is usually to distribute whatever episodes of the show one can find and something must be said about this please be careful what you share
3964526 you see mystery science theater is not just different from other shows due to its premise and wit
3964527 most fans recognize this and being the empathetic and intelligent souls that fans of the show somehow tend to be they tend to look out for the rights of the shows originators
3964528 now as it happens there are plenty of episodes that will likely never be made available for dvd release this is because to legally sell a dvd of an episode of mst3k
3964529 now this being the internet not every fan of the show cares a whit about the rights of joel and jim either because theyre not familiar with the shows quasi organized fandom or they just dont care
3964530 so that is the situation regarding the trading of episode files if you do trade episodes online might i suggest that as a gesture of good will towards the owners that you both refrain from trading episodes available on dvd and to purchase some of those dvds it is true that this likely will
3964531 thus they refuse to share episodes that are available for sale on dvd as this leads to a direct loss of income for the chief brains
3964532 now this being the internet not every fan of the show cares a whit about the rights of joel and jim either because theyre not familiar with the shows quasi organized fandom or they just dont care
3964533 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3964534 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3964535 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3964536 russia has much more to lose than the soviet union had to lose in 1968
3964537 russia has one foot in integration into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in
3964538 russia is going to have to assure its integration into the wto and the oecd and the g8 and institutions like that
3964539 to undermine our relations to curtail our relations we might as well let the united states deal on its own with some of the issues
3964540 it is hard to imagine that georgian president mikheil saakashvili embarked on this risky venture without some sort of approval from the side of the united states
3964541 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3964542 has a responsibility to follow through its promise to halt the attacks and remove russian troops from the country
3964543 sea un motor de la integraci n sudamericana an logo a lo que es la uni n europea
3964544 cuando varios presidentes sudamericanos nos reunamos seguramente en asunci n
3964545 nos contenta mucho el aplastante triunfo que logr el presidente morales
3964546 un intento separatista violento y hasta criminal para desestabilizar su administraci n
3964547 there may be some differences of opinion on some issues on major issues such as iran and also the middle east
3964548 but when it comes to anti semitism i think were on the same page
3964549 we mentioned our concerns about anti semitism and asked him what his position was
3964550 and he said he was certainly not an anti semite
3964551 all forms of anti semitism discrimination against minorities and anti muslim sentiment
3964552 the global jewish community is more at peace with president chavez
3964553 we murdered him so says that man who shouts a lot on msnbc about this terrible story which i include
3964554 graham linehan writer of the peerless geek sitcom the it crowd wants our help in providing props for the third
3964555 okay ive held off long enough what should we make of the two bits of the opening ceremony that werent
3964556 riesengro en zucker und fettgehalt des amerikanischen fr hst cks
3964557 yes sir prime rib is the special tonight very good sir rare it is might i suggest a bottle of fisherman riesling excellent with your chosen dish sir goes well with the ladys poached sole as well
3964558 b d dobry jak chleb z kt rego ka dy mo e u ama i skosztowa
3964559 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months
3964560 jest pocz tkiem jej niezwyk ego ycia i niezwyk ego macierzy stwa
3964561 he does not appear to be so confused when more than one thing comes at him at once anymore
3964562 this is the story of how i came to drill a hole in my skull to get permanently high
3964563 when youre a teenager it can be embarrassing enough just to be seen in public with your parent let alone to have all your friends know about your dads sexual escapades
3964564 teens count on their parents to look out for their best interests and to take care of them and their family now theyve been betrayed
3964565 theyve even been betrayed financially when their father took money that should have been used for their family and instead spent it on his sexual gratification its like spending it on drugs
3964566 it makes him seem like such a hypocrite now and young people have a far lower tolerance for hypocrisy than adults so it will make it especially hard for them to deal with this
3964567 theyre at a time 13 15 and 18 when theyre starting to date and finding out that the man they love most has betrayed their mom and family could cause them to distrust any boy they start to get close to because he may break their hearts
3964568 if eliot spitzer has been a good and decent father i believe that even teenage daughters can put this experience in context
3964569 he must say to them i need to understand why i would have taken this risk not just with my own career but with your feelings and i will be there for you 1 000 percent now
3964570 spring break trips are a risk factor for escalated alcohol use
3964571 the mens reported levels of alcohol consumption binge drinking and intoxication were significantly higher than the womens
3964572 is even now so scandalous as to exceed the limits of reasonable toleration
3964573 an awful lot of cultures have institutionalized bingeing as a kind of time out like mardi gras or new years eve a culturally recognized period where a certain amount of acting out is acceptable
3964574 no significant difference between those who got alcohol and those who didnt
3964575 their behavior was totally determined by their expectations of how they would behave
3964576 we told her that yes in fact she was drinking it
3964577 i felt that we have tupperware parties and candle parties to protect our food and house so why not have a taser party to learn how to protect our lives and bodies
3964578 when youre going out to a nightclub or you have the device clipped onto your belt at a business meeting you dont want to look like dirty harry
3964579 24 seems to have developed a love affair with this kind of weaponry
3964580 everyone needs to accessorize with a hot pink taser c2
3964581 they say every man should leave something to be remembered by
3964582 one good thing about not having any zoning is you can do stuff
3964583 i was the whipping boy and she would just be reduced to tears a lot of times and i would come in and say stuff and i would put out little bits just to pull her out of it
3964584 he just wanted to eat him he didnt want to kill him
3964585 billy has since claimed that he left the stern show because wxrk management refused to give him a sufficient pay raise
3964586 to further a tortuous act namely intentional infliction of emotional distress
3964587 to my knowledge it is the first case of its kind in the nation
3964588 but when an adult violates terms on a myspace account to gain information that creates this type of reaction it caused this office to take a really hard look
3964589 i am deeply disappointed we thought when the st louis prosecutors took a look at the case and decided not to bring charges that was the end of it i dont think the statute they used fits the facts in the indictments
3964590 i have never in 18 years as a prosecutor seen the statute used that way cybercrimes is a relatively new area but i am not sure this statute technically covers the essence of the harm
3964591 myspace does not tolerate cyberbullying and is cooperating fully with the u s attorney in this matter
3964592 i have concerns about the term cyberbullying being applied to this situation
3964593 cyberbullying usually occurs between peers it is not this kind of action
3964594 ayah mengapa wajah ayah kian berkerut merut dengan badan ayah yang kian hari kian terbungkuk
3964595 ibu mengapa wajah ayah jadi berkerut merut dan badannya kian hari kian terbungkuk dan sepertinya ayah menjadi demikian tanpa ada keluhan dan rasa sakit
3964596 anakku jika seorang laki laki yang benar benar bertanggung jawab terhadap keluarga itu memang akan demikian
3964597 saat ku ciptakan laki laki aku membuatnya sebagai pemimpin keluarga serta sebagai tiang penyangga dari bangunan keluarga dia senantiasa akan berusaha untuk menahan setiap ujungnya agar keluarganya merasa aman teduh dan terlindungi
3964598 ku ciptakan bahunya yang kekar dan berotot untuk membanting tulang menghidupi seluruh keluarganya dan kegagahannya harus cukup kuat pula untuk melindungi seluruh keluarganya
3964599 ku berikan kemauan padanya agar selalu berusaha mencari sesuap nasi yang berasal dari tetes keringatnya sendiri yang halal dan bersih agar keluarganya tidak terlantar walaupun seringkali dia mendapat cercaan dari anak anaknya
3964600 ku berikan keperkasaan dan mental baja yang akan membuat dirinya pantang menyerah demi keluarganya dia merelakan kulitnya tersengat panasnya matahari demi keluarganya dia merelakan badannya berbasah kuyup kedinginan karena tersiram hujan dan dihembus angin dia relakan tenaga perkasanya terkuras demi keluarganya dan yang selalu dia ingat adalah disaat semua orang menanti kedatangannya dengan mengharapkan hasil dari jerih payahnya
3964601 kuberikan kesabaran ketekunan serta keuletan yang akan membuat dirinya selalu berusaha merawat dan membimbing keluarganya tanpa adanya keluh kesah walaupun disetiap perjalanan hidupnya keletihan dan kesakitan kerapkali menyerangnya
3964602 ku berikan perasaan keras dan gigih untuk berusaha berjuang demi mencintai dan mengasihi keluarganya didalam kondisi dan situasi apapun juga walaupun tidaklah jarang anak anaknya melukai perasaannya melukai hatinya padahal perasaannya itu pula yang telah memberikan perlindungan rasa aman pada saat dimana anak anaknya tertidur lelap serta sentuhan perasaannya itulah yang memberikan kenyamanan bila saat dia sedang menepuk nepuk bahu anak anaknya agar selalu saling menyayangi dan saling mengasihi sesama saudara
3964603 ku berikan kebijaksanaan dan kemampuan padanya untuk memberikan pengertian dan kesadaran terhadap anak anaknya tentang saat kini dan saat mendatang walaupun seringkali ditentang bahkan dilecehkan oleh anak anaknya
3964604 ku berikan kebijaksanaan dan kemampuan padanya untuk memberikan pengetahuan dan menyadarkan bahwa isteri yang baik adalah isteri yang setia terhadap suaminya isteri yang baik adalah isteri yang senantiasa menemani dan bersama sama menghadapi perjalanan hidup baik suka maupun duka walaupun seringkali kebijaksanaannya itu akan menguji setiap kesetiaan yang diberikan kepada isteri agar tetap berdiri bertahan sejajar dan saling melengkapi serta saling menyayangi
3964605 ku berikan kerutan diwajahnya agar menjadi bukti bahwa laki laki itu senantiasa berusaha sekuat daya pikirnya untuk mencari dan menemukan cara agar keluarganya bisa hidup didalam keluarga bahagia dan badannya yang terbungkuk agar dapat membuktikan bahwa sebagai laki laki yang bertanggung jawab terhadap seluruh keluarganya senantiasa berusaha mencurahkan sekuat tenaga serta segenap perasaannya kekuatannya keuletannya demi kelangsungan hidup keluarganya
3964606 ku berikan kepada laki laki tanggung jawab penuh sebagai pemimpin keluarga sebagai tiang penyangga agar dapat dipergunakan dengan sebaik baiknya dan hanya inilah kelebihan yang dimiliki oleh laki laki walaupun sebenarnya tanggung jawab ini adalah amanah di dunia
3964607 yes is humid place am grateful for chance to rest tired feet will be more grateful still when can leave stinking rat hole planet in rear view mirror
3964608 yeah that and im thinking it could be a sign of trouble too
3964609 hey you mugs whats the big idea anyway let us loose or were gonna get sore see
3964610 its probably just a figment of your emasculation yan this jungle gives me the creeps too
3964611 yes is same sound as before sound like cow learning to yodel
3964612 hundreds of homes rendered uninhabitable families finances stretched to the limit some driven away altogether to take shelter with friends or family but unlike katrina this calamity is clearly visible on the horizon and we have months to prepare
3964613 people in the north understand that it would be inhumane to stand by while seniors freeze to death this winter or kids get sick
3964614 people in hot weather states know heat waves can be killers
3964615 a vote on legislation that would open up the continental shelf to oil drilling
3964616 i understand the games that are played in washington but it doesnt make the obstruction tactics any less revolting
3964617 this is life or death people are dying in the summer heat people will freeze to death this winter

3964619 o que despertou a minha vontade de falar sobre a biografia e tamb m a rela o de paulo coelho com o raul foram as entrevistas que venho assistindo dele inclusive na veja falando sobre drogas e magia negra como os motivos do afastamento dos dois como raul seixas n o est aqui para se defender me sinto sufocado ao observar e ter que assistir tudo isso calado
3964620 quem iniciou o raul nessa hist ria toda de magia negra foi o pr prio paulo coelho agora ele vir dizer o contr rio e raul n o est aqui para se defender duro
3964621 como raul tinha uma filha pequena e estava sem renda foi um momento importante para ele o trabalho na gravadora foi um despertar da sua m sica
3964622 lembro que raul come ou a ficar agressivo e a alquimia entre os dois tornou se algo explosivo e arrogante eles come aram a ter id ias de querer salvar o mundo ou domin lo
3964623 raul sempre seria o raul seixas independente de qualquer um mas o paulo coelho nunca seria quem ele hoje esse grande vendedor de livros sem a exist ncia de raul seixas foi raul quem abriu as portas para que paulo pudesse conhecer editoras e se colocar no mundo como escritor
3964624 eles come aram a n o mais se suportar lembro que raul dizia que paulo era materialista demais e isso angustiava muito ele
3964625 ele era muito apaixonado por discos voadores e a aproxima o de raul em paulo foi exclusivamente essa saber mais sobre os extraterrestres
3964626 lembro muito bem que cheguei na casa do raul fui recebido pela esposa dele e eles estavam com a filha de tr s meses na poca
3964627 lembro disso como se fosse hoje e tudo para raul era estranho quem mais falava na casa era o paulo
3964628 ele n o parava de falar e a repeti o sobre o assunto foi tamanha que eu comprei um exemplar do livro
3964629 gosto muito da lembran a dele em mim apesar das dist ncias
3964630 na minha idade os beatles j eram conhecidos no planeta e eu ainda n o sou ningu m n o passo de um merda
3964631 the history of behavior of these men including the current matter does not reflect the standard of excellence we aspire to on and off the mat we have outstanding student athletes in our program and we will move forward in a positive manner toward our goals i want to personally apologize for any embarrassment that may have been caused for our athletic department the university and our fans
3964632 if nebraska is going to be pigheaded and kick him off unreasonably there has to be another wrestling program thats going to want him
3964633 its not money that they would be making working as a waiter they get well compensated its better than beer money im in my mid 40s and my generation has a stigma about porn the kids the generation of the student athletes dont have that stigma they really dont care theyve come from a paris hilton tommy lee pamela anderson sex tape generation myspace pages the shame and stigma arent there for them theyre mostly worried about what their parents are going to think because their parents think its horrifying
3964634 wait youre not going to move to cali and then divorce me are you
3964635 baby you should know by now that whether you like it or not we are going to be together until we die
3964636 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3964637 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3964638 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3964639 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3964640 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3964641 great when my 17 month old grand daughter turns 3 i want her to be in your class
3964642 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3964643 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3964644 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3964645 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3964646 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3964647 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3964648 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3964649 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3964650 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3964669 the angel of the lord is represented in scripture as a heavenly being sent by god to deal with men as his personal agent and spokesman in many passages he is virtually identified with god and speaks not merely in the name of god but as god in the first person singular
3964670 well lord i really need some time to pray about this
3964671 i never heard god speak to me in an audible voice he just doesnt speak to us anymore like he did to people back in the bible days how do i hear god speaking to me and in what ways does he speak
3964672 sometimes we become so focused on our destination or our perception of gods plan or destination that we may miss opportunities to share the love of christ along the way
3964673 philips sensitivity to the leadership of the holy spirit enabled him to hear and respond to god we become more sensitive to gods leading when we develop a close personal walk with him it is through personal bible study and prayer that we come to know god and his ways
3964674 of whom does the prophet say this of himself or of some other man
3964675 he explained the passage answering the questions and telling the good news there are many people around us who have never heard the truths of the bible we must be sensitive to the opportunities to help people move from where they are to an understanding of the gospel
3964676 go therefore and make disciples of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit teaching them to observe all things that i have commanded you

3964872 for he was foreknown before the foundation of the world but has appeared in these last times for the sake of you who through him are believers in god who raised him from the dead and gave him glory so that your faith and hope are in god
3964873 for whom he foreknew he also predestined to become conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many brethren
3964874 god has not rejected his people whom he foreknew or do you not know what the scripture says in the passage about elijah how he pleads with god against israel
3964875 i can confidently say that the events that led to the 2003 blackout are now much less likely to occur

3964898 people tend to sort each other into categories and the question is in which one do we land
3964899 people who select a soft rock melody will surely be viewed by others as romantic
3964900 there are people who consider such a choice embarrassing or a bit cocked
3964901 the central question is does the ringtone suit me and the company
3964902 i am an absolute fan of the simpsons and for years have had the television comedy shows theme song on my cell phone
3964903 ive been approached in the underground after my cell phone rang and ive received shows of support when my phone rings while out in a pub
3964904 a person who downloads the star wars theme song is hoping it will help him reach others who share the same interest
3964905 treatment methods borrowed from medicine are taking hold in perfumeries
3964906 an ultrasound device whose waves penetrate deep enough to be effective would cost far too much
3964907 a rich cream then can be easily worked into the skin
3964908 such a treatment should be done only once every six weeks
3964909 if a microdermabrasion is to be really effective a lay person must be careful
3964910 in the worst case it can leave chemical burns on the skin
3964911 the skin of our test subjects looked exactly the same after a treatment as before the money can be saved for other purposes
3964912 everything that the cosmetic industry offers in skin care products on the shelf is sufficient for taking care of normal skin

3964920 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points

3964922 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3964923 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3964925 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3964926 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3964927 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3964928 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3964929 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3964930 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3964931 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3964932 average winter bee losses due to poor weather and disease vary from between 5 and 10 so a 30 loss is deeply worrying this spells serious trouble for pollination services and honey producers
3964933 we dont know why there is a difference and what is behind the high mortality

3965148 what if someone is going to kill your wife and family
3965149 hell yeah im gonna get a fortune out of this idiot
3965150 oh no no no no no no thats not possible
3965151 the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent
3965152 in light of the fact that were now in iraq with all the problems in terms of perceptions about america that have been created us launching some missile strikes into iran is not the optimal position for us to be in
3965153 on the other hand having a radical muslim theocracy in possession of nuclear weapons is worse so i guess my instinct would be to err on not having those weapons in the possession of the ruling clerics of iran i hope it doesnt get to that point
3965154 russia averts humanitarian crisis in separatist georgian states of south ossetia and abkhazia
3965155 we will preserve our territorial integrity georgia will never be divided we will win
3965156 i will have no lobbyists working on my campaign except for the 130 working on my campaign
3965157 ok guys and girls we need to get to work this osama bastard is making everyone realize that im old and senile in comparison so lets come up with something clever that makes me look worldly and presidential which lobbyist has the most money to spend
3965158 if only we had gotten that loan we would have survived
3965159 guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3965160 we have totally reclaimed the villages occupied by rebels but troops are still clearing the areas of land mines left behind by the milf forces
3965161 they want to attend to their farms and return to their normal life but land mines and unexploded munitions are posing a danger to civilians
3965162 troops are carefully clearing the areas slowly and inch by inch to really ensure that no explosives are left behind
3965163 we have complied with the agreement between the cease fire committees to reposition our forces to avoid further clashes
3965164 had militias not attacked the milf there would have been no hostilities in north cotabato
3965165 certain actions be taken to prevent fatigue cracking on critical areas of the forward pressure bulkhead which could result in rapid decompression of the aircraft fuselage
3965166 not a safety issue my arse these aircraft may have been flying for up to five years with missing parts
3965167 it fails to take into account that qantas as is always the case received the approval of boeing and casa for this work before it was undertaken
3965168 all modifications qantas performed on the boeing 737 aircraft were to a standard specifically approved by boeing and casa
3965169 the jack screw is an important component that has been known to seize up in the past regular lubrication and checking of the jack screw is vital because corrosion poses a real risk and must be eliminated to prevent this key component from seizing up
3965170 boeing issued a directive that this component needed to be checked more rigorously and more regularly
3965171 there was a maintenance issue involving the lubrication of a jack screw on a boeing 747 400 qantas found this through a routine check of our maintenance records
3965172 the jack screw had been inspected and the aircraft will operate tomorrow
3965173 there is no connection at all with any other aircraft incident
3965174 the alaska incident involved a different aircraft type and design with different safety features
3965175 as the russians move into georgia as aggressors and if you read the statements from the beginning from senator mccain and senator obama one had a kind of moral neutrality to it
3965176 and i say it respectfully to senator obama because hes a gifted young man but hes not ready to be president on jan 20th of 2009
3965177 i think that whatever we think at the moment that we can all reserve that for a future time
3965178 and i think judgments will be made about how we handled this situation how we approached the situation in iraq and how much experience and knowledge and background means in selecting the american peoples decision about who should be commander in chief
3965179 but i dont think were going to reignite the cold war here with russia i think this is a very serious situation but i dont see this as a return to nuclear standoffs et cetera et cetera
3965180 discussions about an international peacekeeping operation including canvassing nations for possible contributions to such a force
3965181 im sorry to be repetitious this is no time for that this is no time for that the time now is for the united states of america to act united on behalf of the people of the country of georgia and not do a lot of partisan sniping
3965182 and i say it respectfully to senator obama because hes a gifted young man but hes not ready to be president on jan 20th of 2009
3965183 yesterday i heard senator mccain say we are all georgians now
3965184 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
3965185 devil went down to georgia and he was willing to make a deal
3965186 mccain wanted to make a distinction between himself and obama he did he overreacted was shooting from the hip and showed that he had an opinion before he had the facts this is what bush did in iraq mccain may even be more dangerous because he did not learn from iraq bush at least waited until the facts were available
3965187 having to chose between these two unqualified pro globalization back slappers is a disgrace at least hillary seemed like she had a brain between her ears
3965188 may we sit down and ask you a few questions

3965206 se mueven dentro de un circuito financiado por el gobierno gringo de eu para diseminar sus pol ticas imperialistas y lo que ellos creen del concepto de democracia
3965207 es un circuito que se monta de acuerdo a los fines objetivos y prop sitos del imperio todos sabemos que nos estamos moviendo en un mundo donde todav a las pol ticas imperiales pretenden destruir los caminos que avanzan precisamente en restituci n de derechos para los pueblos que tienen que ser libres
3965208 la falta de inteligencia del imperio norteamericano en su af n de desvirtuar a los gobiernos revolucionarios tal es el caso de nicaragua
3965209 c mo se les ocurre traer a pol ticos fracasados si tuvieran inteligencia debieron de traer a gente que logr resultados para mejorar la vida de sus pueblos pero pol ticos fracasados que destruyeron inclusive a su pa s eso solamente me puede causar risa
3965210 hay mucho en riesgo en este momento aqu en nicaragua

3965223 muhammad itu sekali kali bukanlah bapak dari seorang laki laki di antara kamu tetapi dia adalah rasulullah dan penutup nabi nabi
3965224 dan aku merupakan penutup para nabi tidak ada nabi setelahku
3965225 barangsiapa mencari agama selain dari agama islam maka sekali kali tidaklah akan diterima agama itu daripadanya dan dia di akhirat termasuk orang orang yang rugi
3965226 untuk tiap tiap umat di antara kami kami berikan aturan dan jalan yang terang
3965227 bagi taip tiap masa ada kitab yang tertentu allah menghapuskan apa yang dia kehendaki dan menetapkan apa yang dia kehendaki dan disisinya lah terdapat ummul kitab lauh mahfudz 38 39
3965228 pada hari ini telah aku sempurnakan untuk kamu agamamu dan telah aku cukupkan kepadamu nikmat ku dan telah aku ridhai islam itu menjadi agamamu
3965229 dan kami tidak mengutus kamu melainkan kepada umat manusia seluruhnya
3965230 hai rasul sampaikan apa yang diturunkan kepadamu dari rabbmu al maidah 67
3965231 engkau akan mendatangi sebagian kaum ahli kitab maka hendaklah yang pertama kali engkau dakwahkan ialah syahadat lailaha illallah dan muhammad itu rasulullah
3965232 hai nabi berjihadlah melawan orang orang kafir dan orang orang munafik itu dan bersikap keraslah terhadap mereka tempat mereka adalah neraka jahannam dan itulah tempat kembali yang seburuk buruknya
3965233 dan perangilah mereka itu sehingga tidak ada fitnah lagi dan sehingga agama itu hanya untuk allah belaka

3965299 je dochter vertelde dat zij een mooie lamp had uitgezocht en dat ze het geld niet aan jullie hoefde terug te betalen
3965300 nee natuurlijk niet het is niet iets extras zoals speelgoed of snoep het is iets voor het interieur ter vervanging van iets dat stuk is
3965301 if you find yourself in agreement with the green party then vote for the green party
3965302 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it
3965303 if you have a green party i want to join
3965304 what do you think about our next child coming from ethiopia
3965305 i would like to express that the motivation for this ordinance was purely political and directed specifically at me for the purpose of attacking a perceived political opponent
3965306 its the first vacation ive taken in two years i told the mayor to call me in the event theres a 4 4 tie but otherwise id be away
3965307 my cognizance of hoboken municipal issues allows me to better represent my constituency at the state level
3965308 as a state assemblyman it was my mission to advance local initiatives such as hoboken university medical center the henkel site 1600 park avenue and the soon to be constructed movie theater
3965309 and as your assemblyman i will continue to fight for the benefit of hoboken and the entire 33rd district
3965310 it is a sad day when members of government think they can dictate to the public who may appear on the ballot or hold public office when did maintaining wealth become a prerequisite for holding elective office how do i tell a child in the neighborhood in which i was raised that if you want to serve the public good you must first reach elite financial status
3965311 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but lt 0x200a gt lt 0x200a gt also a cherished friend and confidant
3965312 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3965313 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
3965314 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
3965315 i have two kids im worried about so i have other priorities
3965316 this 11th hour ruling from the bush administration is highly problematic after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it
3965317 as president senator obama will fight to maintain the strong protections of the endangered species act and undo this proposal from president bush
3965318 we found that the women on the tapes who were judged as angry lost out in every category
3965319 when women express anger at work no matter what they do on the job they can be seen as out of control or are viewed in a negative light
3965320 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3965321 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3965322 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3965323 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3965324 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3965325 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3965326 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3965327 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3965328 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3965329 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3965330 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3965331 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3965332 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3965333 you testified at the preliminary inquiry that you actually saw gordon eckstein transpose that note to on april 23 during the 4 04 meeting
3965334 i gave that answer but i think it was wrong
3965335 you confirmed 14 times that the meeting occurred on april 23rd
3965336 if you read the rest of my testimony you will see that it wasnt clear
3965337 i settled on the date based on the dates on the documents
3965338 can i explain why i think there were two meetings
3965339 i have no idea what is important at this trial
3965340 i would suggest to you that one thing you know is very important is that if directions were given to you by mr eckstein to do any manipulations before any meeting with mr gottlieb and mr drabinsky then it means he was doing it on his own
3965341 do you see you were inputting manipulations without any direction from mr drabinsky or mr gottlieb
3965342 im going to suggest to you that it should surprise the hell out of you
3965343 does it not surprise you that gordon eckstein was giving you instructions without getting the approval of mr drabinsky or mr gottlieb
3965344 no the financial statements were issued and they were issued with their approval
3965345 i didnt ask you that doesnt it surprise you that the orders for manipulations didnt come from them
3965346 i would think that fort york would be a point of interest in this city
3965347 but maria messina going to see the rcmp is a point of interest
3965348 whats the point of interest if not for you people to all get together and make sure youre working for the team against garth drabinsky and myron gottlieb
3965349 messina gives the sec her story about finding out about the manipulations after talking to you and grant malcolm you knew that
3965350 im going to suggest to you that messina called you the night of her sec testimony
3965351 im going to make a serious allegation so wipe that smirk off your face
3965352 messina is very concerned about this us 125 million bond offering she is going to get charged with financial irregularities if she knew about the manipulations before the offering you know that
3965353 the only statement i was ever asked to present was the truth i was never asked to change my statement
3965354 as to choosing the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
3965355 and we are aware that the u s is uptight about this project
3965356 but a choice will have to be made someday between considerations of prestige related to an illusory project and a real partnership in matters which indeed require collective efforts
3965357 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3965358 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
3965359 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3965360 we work very closely with local authorities we dont work anywhere where we are not wanted
3965361 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community to help the poverty hit afghan people
3965362 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
3965363 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001
3965364 cowardly attack yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent
3965365 only a loon would obsess and keep this tirade going for months
3965366 oh they did not increase they declined by how much hmm sounds bad to me but i am not you is that kind of performance ok with you
3965367 when my goggles did fill up there was nothing i could do i could just swim
3965368 at the finish and the 150 metre wall i couldnt see
3965369 im disappointed i knew i could go faster than that
3965370 one of the biggest honours is wearing the stars and stripes every time im out there and now being the greatest olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it
3965371 dude its ridiculous how many times a day i have to see your ugly face
3965372 he makes it look easy but he really works hard at it
3965373 christmas happens every year you can only get to be an olympic gold medalist so many times it never never gets old
3965374 you barely mentioned my son finishing in the top eight
3965375 its not over yet anything can happen in the next three events
3965376 certainty of significant transportation disruptions that will result from simple accidents within a corridor that has no alternate route capacity as a function of its limited access points and geographic alignment thats distant from the existing highway infrastructure
3965377 theres no indication that any of the aliens were involved in any terrorist activity at all
3965378 ice agents were stationed at the security gate and we reviewed all the identity documents of all the people entering at that moment
3965379 when we determined that the alienage or identity of someone inside a vehicle was in question we recommended further inspection
3965380 this is a critical sensitive facility so of course we pay particular attention to it
3965381 its one of the highest priorities of the department of homeland security
3965382 our understanding is that ice has been interrogating the workers without legal counsel despite the fact that an attorney has been literally knocking on the door to get in to help them
3965383 some of these workers are likely to have viable legal claims to stay in the united states

3965387 mccains camp is taking virginia very seriously and if you watch tv in the old dominion youll see a lot of ads for both mccain and obama obama is clearly putting more effort more money in virginia than any other democratic presidential candidate has done in quite some time but john mccain is not taking the state for granted and is hoping for a lot of military turnout in tidewater high support in southwest and hold off obamas of margin of victory in northern virginia and put together a win
3965388 the flames were coming out of the windows the roof started collapsing in the back porch roof fell off i mean it was horrible total destruction
3965389 one of our chihuahuas actually ran back into the house i tried to get him but the heat was too much
3965390 i was so excited so we call him the miracle dog now
3965391 go into flames come out with not a scratch on him
3965392 about five hours later after everybody had left he come walking around the house soaking wet trying to get back in
3965393 its difficult to imagine a circumstance where the government could directly control interest rates without a whole range of adverse consequences occurring a whole range of other things mr tanner told abc radio
3965394 weve seen it in the past for example where we had a cap on interest rates
3965395 what that meant was that people ended up with cocktail loans for their homes where they borrowed a proportion of their mortgage at the official interest rate and had to borrow the rest at a really high interest rate much much higher than the official rate
3965396 now i wouldnt speculate about what they might be and of course its not my direct responsibility mr tanner said
3965397 well cross that bridge if and when we come to it if we believe that the banks are not doing the right thing then clearly we will be examining the options to put greater pressure on
3965398 rolled gold guarantees on rates because theyve got other factors that they have to worry about as well
3965399 but the banks will carry a very heavy onus to explain any variation from any reduction by the reserve bank in the rates as compared with what they actually do mr tanner said
3965400 they will have a very heavy onus to both the government and the community to explain that iga didnt miss chance metcash
3965401 the appropriate role for the federal government is to move as quickly as it can to put in place the new industrial legislation and to urge all parties including telstra to live in the real world to recognise the fact that circumstances have changed and to act in good faith
3965402 telstra has not acted in an honest way they have sought to camouflage their intentions here
3965403 we want work choices to be got rid of as soon as possible
3965404 but we also understand that the federal government has a complex task in dismantling work choices in putting in place a whole new industrial system it is a difficult task
3965405 all we are asking is telstra to be open with us and its employees and put its cards on the table
3965406 of course we looked at the companys options if union negotiations broke down and they did
3965407 of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia
3965408 let me make this very clear that any collective agreement would have nothing to do with awas or work choices and our employees would get to vote on it
3965409 it will be entirely consistent with labor party policy and the law
3965410 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3965411 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
3965412 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3965413 we work very closely with local authorities we dont work anywhere where we are not wanted
3965414 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community to help the poverty hit afghan people
3965415 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
3965416 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001
3965417 cowardly attack yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent
3965418 the market shares for the big three have dropped for the past 50 years so these companies can no longer sustain all the different brands that have been developed over time
3965419 on one hand you have the big three with more brands than their current market positions can support on the other hand you have companies emerging in asia who are growing rapidly but dont have brand recognition in the global marketplace
3965420 those three brands have about 16 market share with those brands you can cover every segment you want to be in and still be profitable
3965421 saab is a nice fit for european automakers or foreign automakers looking to gain a presence in europe

3965424 we still have diplomatic relations with georgia we have millions of georgian nationals who are russian citizens and living happily in russia
3965425 but we wont directly talk to saakashvili we wont do that we offered him peace but not friendship
3965426 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3965427 we do not need nor do we intend to take over any air or seaports in order to deliver humanitarian assistance to those caught in this conflict

3965429 if your normal happy go lucky 12 year old child cant walk unaided for a period of weeks screams in pain cant shower wet and soils herself in her clothes if no one helps her to the toilet cries in the night and cant walk the next day you shouldnt need any medical training to have worked out that she is a very very sick young girl
3965430 the standard of care was not breached in this case
3965431 all of the foundation of the crown case is simply false
3965432 i am asking you ladies and gentleman to put an end to all of this just end it for gods sake and allow her reynolds to grieve

3965435 japan is a comfortable place to live but it is difficult to be yourself
3965436 difficult to be yourself go to harajuku one of the trendiest places in tokyo where many young people who enjoy counterculture congregate and see people being themselves it isnt difficult you just have to make sacrifices just like you do anywhere if you want to be yourself in the u k then you have to live with the consequences that might mean living on the fringes of society you can do that in japan if you dont want to be a salary man you can be something else but you cant live in the same society the normal salary man does that is the compromise you must pay

3965444 perhaps they should have done a lot more before this day
3965445 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
3965446 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3965447 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
3965448 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
3965449 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early
3965450 instructions are being developed and being sent to boards of election across the state to make sure voting is consistent
3965451 there is no question that the huge effort to register and turn out voters at ohio state university is going to have a positive impact on our race

3965461 into the wilds fairy tale characters are fascinating and julie is everything one could want in a heroine shes intelligent practical determined and brave at once more ordinary and more extraordinary than she herself thinks she is ill be keeping an eye out for more work from sarah beth durst
3965462 an amazing wild ride with very high stakes and the fate of humans and fairytale people alike on the shoulders of one determined girl this is even better than the first book
3965463 this is one of those rare occasions when the sequel is as good as the first book if not better though in my estimation they make two halves of one story and what a wonderfully entertaining story it is

3965522 we hike along limestone bluffs then downhill into the wetlands around the creek which is called the riparian zone

3965542 melalui siasatan yang dilakukan kawasan tersebut didapati telah mengalami hakisan dan runtuhan serta kewujudan pokok pokok besar di cerun itu akan mengundang bahaya kepada para penduduk terutamanya di jalan ss 3 51
3965543 jurutera perunding yang dilantik oleh syabas mengesahkan bahawa terdapat keperluan yang mendesak untuk memperbaiki serta menguatkan keseluruhan cerun di kawasan tapak tersebut
3965544 kaedah yang digunakan ialah soil nailing menaik taraf sistem perparitan memotong pokok di cerun serta menanam rumput bagi menutupi permukaan cerun tersebut
3965545 setelah mengambil kira keselamatan penduduk dan juga saranan daripada jurutera perunding penebangan keseluruhan pokok yang kebanyakannya berumur di antara 10 hingga 25 tahun di kawasan cerun berkenaan adalah perlu kerana didapati pokok pokok itu telah reput dari dalam dan hanya menunggu cuaca lembap seperti hujan serta angin kuat bagi menumbangkannya
3965546 pokok pokok itu juga berisiko membahayakan keselamatan para penduduk di kawasan terlibat memandangkan jaraknya adalah kira kira lima hingga 10 meter dari rumah rumah penduduk
3965547 oleh demikian cerun yang pada pandangan penduduk tidak bahaya juga telah diperkukuhkan untuk faedah jangka masa panjang
3965548 penanaman semula pokok di cerun itu tidak digalakkan kerana kedudukannya yang tidak sesuai dan tidak akan membantu mengukuhkan tebing kerana akarnya tidak boleh mencengkam kuat

3965553 to be honest guy if they dont do the right thing then im not going to waste my life fighting the good fight ill vote with my feet
3965554 we showed them all this really cool stuff that wed been perfecting for the last two years we were so proud of how well it all worked
3965555 look at how hard i work how smart i am and how wonderful are the things i create which gets you moved up the ladder but then eventually you are in the leadership group you are at the top of that ladder and everyone who has made it there is guess what like you
3965556 well theres nothing wrong with a bit of bs here and there
3965557 i love the smell of 360 degree feedback reports being printed in the morning is optional
3965558 the final requirement of effective leadership is to earn trust otherwise there wont be any followers and the only definition of a leader is someone who has followers
3965559 one of the greatest mistakes of a successful person is the assumption
3965560 the difference between a lady and a flower girl is not how she behaves but how she is treated

3965576 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
3965577 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
3965578 similar but similar enough that they could probably slip this into a cable re airing of
3965579 heck yeah hed loved to so i look at renee as to say here we go
3965580 hey my aunt is in the hospital you know why because she got bit by a spider a really really bad spider it was eating away at her neck
3965581 we are under my leadership really interested in partnering with local artists and people who have different styles than we usually see on our stage
3965582 hip hop is the most important musical change of our time more young people listen to it than anything else im really interested in nurturing the next generation of artists and this is one way to start connecting with them
3965583 i thought this would be a great way to just kind of kick it off
3965584 it gives the theater community an opportunity to see what hip hop is about and it gives the hip hop community an opportunity to see what theater is about
3965585 it will be cool to see how hip hop manifests itself in kansas city
3965586 kansas city has been extremely generous to the lyric opera and we wanted to take this opportunity to show our gratitude as we celebrate the last 50 years and anticipate the bright future of the company
3965587 we hope these 25 tickets will allow us to extend our efforts of making world class opera accessible to all members of our community

3965591 the gamers will joke that they hate playing kids because kids tend to roll incredibly well
3965592 but this isnt like a re enactment unless the rules are set up to simulate a historical battle youre just in command of the army or a wing of the army and you have to make decisions that determine the outcome of that single game
3965593 we just want to expose more people to it and they might find it fun for them too
3965594 i get a lot of fun out of preparing for these battles and the social aspect of sitting across a table from another gamer and doing a lot of trash talking
3965595 its a lot more like the 90s era of hip hop where there was a lot of sampling and not necessarily knowledge rap but a lot of real live down to earth type of natural experience stuff from an mc as opposed to flashy things or gangsta killing spree material

3965636 in the short term gold prices are likely to continue to take their lead from dollar movements and oil prices
3965637 the lack of bullish reaction by traditional safe haven assets to the clash between russian and georgian forces suggests the need for cash to cover losses in other sectors will continue to outweigh geopolitical tensions in the short term
3965638 it has been a quite good month for the market and volume alone rose by about 30 percent compared with july last year
3965639 also if you look at this month so far sales figures are high and i think by the end of this quarter we will see a 20 percent increase and the current prices are encouraging more buyers to get into the market
3965640 the drop in imports was happening globally and compared to other regions the performance of the dubai market was very positive
3965641 i climbed up on alexandras double bed and wept in a general way for the fate of men

3965676 is no religion in the world that accepts such acts
3965677 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3965678 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
3965679 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
3965680 it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission
3965681 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3965682 we just reacted because we didnt have any other option any civilized country would act same way

3965684 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
3965685 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
3965686 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
3965687 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
3965688 and i think ridge is a great example of that
3965689 far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights you know a number of other issues
3965690 ive been working valet for the past three years and over that time my tips have declined some of the regulars i valet for used to give 15 tips but over the past year they have decreased as low as 5
3965691 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3965692 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3965693 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3965694 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3965695 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3965696 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3965697 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3965698 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3965699 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3965700 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3965701 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3965702 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3965704 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3965705 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3965710 the market shares for the big three have dropped for the past 50 years so these companies can no longer sustain all the different brands that have been developed over time
3965711 on one hand you have the big three with more brands than their current market positions can support on the other hand you have companies emerging in asia who are growing rapidly but dont have brand recognition in the global marketplace
3965712 those three brands have about 16 market share with those brands you can cover every segment you want to be in and still be profitable
3965713 saab is a nice fit for european automakers or foreign automakers looking to gain a presence in europe

3965716 its difficult to imagine a circumstance where the government could directly control interest rates without a whole range of adverse consequences occurring a whole range of other things mr tanner told abc radio
3965717 weve seen it in the past for example where we had a cap on interest rates
3965718 what that meant was that people ended up with cocktail loans for their homes where they borrowed a proportion of their mortgage at the official interest rate and had to borrow the rest at a really high interest rate much much higher than the official rate
3965719 now i wouldnt speculate about what they might be and of course its not my direct responsibility mr tanner said
3965720 well cross that bridge if and when we come to it if we believe that the banks are not doing the right thing then clearly we will be examining the options to put greater pressure on
3965721 rolled gold guarantees on rates because theyve got other factors that they have to worry about as well
3965722 but the banks will carry a very heavy onus to explain any variation from any reduction by the reserve bank in the rates as compared with what they actually do mr tanner said
3965723 they will have a very heavy onus to both the government and the community to explain that iga didnt miss chance metcash
3965724 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
3965725 i think hes undisputedly the greatest swimmer of all time
3965726 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
3965727 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
3965728 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3965729 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3965730 he is not from another planet he is from the future
3965731 being on the team with him these past couple of years a lot of us take what he does for granted
3965732 we expect him to break world records we expect him to win
3965733 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
3965734 were saying the oss was a lot bigger than they were saying
3965735 an apartment where i have a library and a sort of office where i prepare talks and conferences
3965736 i was just noticing how pretty all these flowers are
3965737 do you think you might get a tattoo one day
3965738 um maybe but probably one that is a little more private probably one that im the only one who knows its there
3965739 just because someone comes up and says something doesnt mean its true
3965740 the credibility of the female witnesses all of whom have faced multiple felony counts of drug and other offenses will play a crucial role in the trial we have a lot of evidence to present
3965741 most of these offenses are aggravating especially when they come from any public official who had imposed upon them the duty of care and trust
3965742 i just tried to black out the whole thing it was bad
3965743 japan will join hands with international efforts to create an environment for dialogue to prevent any recurrence of military conflict from ethnic tensions and to work toward a peaceful solution to this issue
3965744 wow i could never do that im just so glad to get them out of my hair all day
3965745 well sure if youre kid is at school from 8 3 every single day and brings home a couple of hours of homework wheres the fun in that you play drill sergeant in the morning rushing them through breakfast and out to the bus on time and then later on that day you have the pleasure of greeting a kid who is either exhausted or needs to release all the energy theyve had to contain all day long and then you get to hustle them through hours of homework dinner and all the prep for the following day i dont think that sounds like the type of relationship id want any more of either
3965746 im okay ive even got a couple of books back here
3965747 now if you change your mind about this vbac thing we can always just section you
3965748 oh this boys going to be just the right size
3965749 i dont really want to answer that take that answer for what you will
3965750 we had always planned that the end of the series would involve noah returning because he was so central as a new character at the very beginning an entering character growing up in the er so we pulled out those old notes and came out with a lot of new things
3965751 wells has had the finale thought out for years and has even been taking notes for a while now

3965756 he has an interesting genetic profile that in certain sorts of medical contexts theyve noticed that many times serial killers have that same genetic profile
3965757 whoever comes in and joins the team after grissom is going to be a different guy but the nature of the show and what fans get out of it thats not going to change
3965758 maybe they were preoccupied with other life issues or selfish or stupid or stubborn
3965759 if your normal happy go lucky 12 year old child cant walk unaided for a period of weeks screams in pain cant shower wet and soils herself in her clothes if no one helps her to the toilet cries in the night and cant walk the next day you shouldnt need any medical training to have worked out that she is a very very sick young girl
3965760 the standard of care was not breached in this case
3965761 all of the foundation of the crown case is simply false
3965762 i am asking you ladies and gentleman to put an end to all of this just end it for gods sake and allow her reynolds to grieve
3965763 if it is your view that facs should have done more well perhaps they should have
3965764 perhaps they should have done a lot more before this day
3965765 it just broke my heart because you know there was so much left
3965766 when i woke up that morning he had passed so i didnt get to see him
3965767 witnessed terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic georgians
3965768 we still have diplomatic relations with georgia we have millions of georgian nationals who are russian citizens and living happily in russia
3965769 but we wont directly talk to saakashvili we wont do that we offered him peace but not friendship
3965770 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3965771 we do not need nor do we intend to take over any air or seaports in order to deliver humanitarian assistance to those caught in this conflict
3965772 i would love to design one day i do not have the time right now but i would love to develop a home line or a clothing line so we will see what comes first
3965773 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3965774 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
3965775 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3965776 we work very closely with local authorities we dont work anywhere where we are not wanted
3965777 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community to help the poverty hit afghan people
3965778 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
3965779 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001
3965780 cowardly attack yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent
3965781 the appropriate role for the federal government is to move as quickly as it can to put in place the new industrial legislation and to urge all parties including telstra to live in the real world to recognise the fact that circumstances have changed and to act in good faith
3965782 telstra has not acted in an honest way they have sought to camouflage their intentions here
3965783 we want work choices to be got rid of as soon as possible
3965784 but we also understand that the federal government has a complex task in dismantling work choices in putting in place a whole new industrial system it is a difficult task
3965785 all we are asking is telstra to be open with us and its employees and put its cards on the table
3965786 of course we looked at the companys options if union negotiations broke down and they did
3965787 of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia
3965788 let me make this very clear that any collective agreement would have nothing to do with awas or work choices and our employees would get to vote on it
3965789 the measures taken by the police were in no way directed against animal welfare or animal welfare organizations
3965790 yes animal protection is terribly important to me and i have dedicated my life to it

3965797 once again the bush administration is carelessly playing partisan politics with womens health care
3965798 time and again this administration has jeopardized womens access to essential family planning services for purely ideological reasons sound science and responsible public health practices should never be trumped by political ideology this proposal is unnecessary and would be harmful to womens health
3965799 lets not talk about that and just hope it continues
3965800 we got good hitting both games and really good pitching

3965825 one of them being hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants

3966026 he really has become a thorn in the bookmakers side
3966027 but phelps is such a phenomenon we have seen interest in him
3966028 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league
3966029 you look at kids they take their shoes off and run around all the time maybe his feet were hurting that day well educate him a little bit more and tell him about keeping his shoes on till he gets inside we dont like things to happen but they happen what can you do other than try to educate them
3966030 it would take a serious unexpected setback for him to be unavailable for the cowboys game
3966031 no one will talk on the record about any potential move of tribe prospects from buffalo to columbus
3966032 the process has been outlined well go through september and then people will talk
3966033 but i would have my head in the sand to think there arent some back channel things going on
3966034 there have been many challenges but the greatest one is probably trying to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of the organization both on and off the ice this takes time and being around the people on a daily basis i believe any strong organization starts with good people in the right places and now that i have spent a full year here i feel that i have a better handle on our strengths and weaknesses
3966035 were going to have a lot of the basics on the menu some really nice salads at lunchtime thai chicken salad and shrimp salads

3966039 dude thats in play get the heck off the wall
3966040 nor are we to judge of what one can do by any precedents so little has been tried it matters not what the clocks say or the attitudes and labors of men morning is when i am awake and there is a dawn in me
3966041 id go id probably go like milan or something like that where i grew up or something like that peace out do you know any reasonable person that would turn down 50 million dollars because i grew up in italy it has more significance to me because im more familiar with it ive been there and i still have friends there im thinking about buying a house out there it would be nothing to me to be able to do that
3966042 if someone wants to throw 50 million on the table for me we can talk
3966043 they throw 30 40 50 million a year at me i cant turn that down i think right now its very exciting theyre starting a new buzz you start to do a little research and they got money over there you stay in the states you make the max you make 18 million take out taxes and you have 9 10 you have an opportunity to go somewhere and make 25 30 tax free we might have to pack our bags
3966044 it would definitely be something id consider you can never say never to anything the olympics have shown how this game has grown its not just the united states game anymore its the worlds game
3966045 as a businessman i would have to consider it if my wife was down and the money was right
3966046 from a business standpoint you have to at least listen to every offer
3966047 youre right only cska dynamo and khimki are the teams with huge money in europe along with olympiakos and panathinaikos from greece so if we are talking about lebron or kobe or any other superstar it all comes down to these five teams bc triumph formerly dynamo moscow region surprised everybody by signing krstic to a three million euro per year deal but its their only big buy so far and nobody knows what will happen next i think it is possible that one of these teams will find the money for an nba superstar yet 50 million is still outlandish were not talking about going roughly from 25 million team payroll to 32 million as was the case with childress but going from 25 million to 75 million it would make a little more sense if we were talking about what would be a 50 million a year nba contract which would equal about 17 million euros per year im sure that teams are preparing for talks and nobody is actually ready to just throw out 50 million now anyway its hard to predict anything because this will be an unprecedented move that will change the way we think now about sports contracts cska used to be the team paying crazy salaries compared to other teams in europe but for the last several seasons they have been coached by ettore messina and instead of chasing big names they try to get players that will fit the system this season when everyone is signing superstars the biggest names cska got are zoran planinic and erazem lorbek they are not the team that puts all their eggs in one basket messina is only signed until next summer though so well see what happens also cska has the most success in terms of public relations is well known everywhere in the world and they may be ready to spend to make the next step in these terms if youre nike youd want your player to be in moscow which is one of the world capitals playing for a well known team khimki have been big spenders for several years and this summer they went over the top the reason for that is they are hoping to get a contract with euroleague next summer when it could become a closed league it was announced that euroleague will look at marketability of the teams so khimki signed not just quality players but well known players from nba teams and successful national teams in carlos delfino and jorge garbajosa they went for the biggest names they thought they could target each player received what would be a 9 million a year nba contract the euroleague contract talks will continue next summer and if khimki are desperate to sign the deal they will have to spend crazy money actually if i were the euroleague i would quietly put pressure on the team and say you get lebron and well sign you to a euroleague contract on the other hand this is a smaller city in moscow region dynamo has a reputation of an underarchieving team here in russia they spend cska like money on their roster yet the results are very different this year they finally got a great coach in david blatt and also signed bostjan nachbar to what would be again a 9 million nba contract they are rumored to be targeting ben gordon now that its known that players of this caliber are available for the right money once again its impossible to tell how far the team can go in terms of spending because whats happening now is unprecedented for years dynamo has been the richest team that is not in the euroleague and they are desperate to get in the league still it is not surprising that it was a greek team which was the first to hand out a huge contract their owners have the most freedom to act because they are just that owners one person for each team russian teams have to find sponsors for each deal either from businesses or local governments which takes time and pursuasion sic if a greek owner feels like spending it will take him a second to give a go ahead to team management eccentric billionaire fan owners is not what russia is about
3966048 even more enticing to james has to be the revelation that earl boykins recently signed contract with italys virtus bologna includes income from bolognas sponsorship and marketing arms due to the nbas collective bargaining agreement this sort of arrangement is off limits in the nba but its exactly what lebron james inc is looking for james is right he wont become a billionaire by playing basketball so he and his management team have begun to look for more than endorsement dollars theyre now interested in equity stakes in the companies lebron lends his name to what if the owners of cska moscow or olympiacos the two teams reported to have contacted james offered him equity stakes in the teams and or outside business ventures they accumulated their billions in in addition to his playing salary an equity stake in a billion dollar business would pay dividends long after james called it quits on the hardwood and it would inch james closer to his stated goal of becoming the richest man in the world if the nbas collective bargaining agreement allowed it you can bet that james would negotiate an ownership percentage in the cavs or the soon to be brooklyn nets or the new york knicks any discussions between james and olympiacos or cska moscow will begin with what the euroleague can offer that the nba cannot
3966049 i wonder if the nba will be forced to adopt an mls style
3966050 european teams have rules that limit the number of non european teams that can be on their roster
3966051 but seriously cleveland cant pay 50 million for lebron nor should any american team pay that

3966112 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3966113 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3966114 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
3966115 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade

3966129 we know weve been told that elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards thats part of the puff pieces on them that weve seen ergo if elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards is it likely that she thinks she knows better than he does what his speeches ought to contain and what kind of things he ought to be doing strategy wise in the campaign if she is smarter than he is could it have been her decision to keep going with the campaign in other words could it be that she doesnt shut up now thats as far as im going to go
3966130 it just seems to me that edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk
3966131 my theory that i just explained to you about why you know what could have john edwards motivations been to have the affair with rielle hunter given his wife is smarter than he is and probably nagging him a lot about doing this and he found somebody that did something with her mouth other than talk

3966200 i suspect that we are coming to the end of this downtrend as applications for new mortgages the most important series have flattened out i dont know but i think the worst of this may well be over
3966201 the drop in u s home prices will probably end well before early next year as the number of houses on the market diminishes aiding an economic rebound
3966202 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
3966203 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
3966204 a necessary condition for an end to the current global financial crisis

3966206 at 82 years old mr greenspan remains sharp and his fascination with the workings of the economy undiminished but his star no longer shines as brightly as it did when he retired from the fed in january 2006
3966207 its the imbalance of supply and demand which causes prices to go down but its ultimately the valuation process of the use of the commodity which tells you where the bottom is
3966208 for example the grain markets can have a huge excess of corn or wheat but the price never goes to zero itll stabilize at some level of prices where people are willing to hold the excess inventory we have little history but the same thing is surely true in housing as well we will get to the point where there will be willing holders of vacant single family dwellings and that will no longer act to depress the price level
3966209 theres no credible argument for bailing out bear stearns and not the gses

3966214 when the research firm realtytrac inc releases its latest foreclosure report thursday dont be surprised if the number of filings declines again last month realtytrac reported that foreclosure filings totaled 252 363 in june down 3 from the previous month some analysts are expecting the july data to show another decline or very little change if that happens could the improvement be a sign that the foreclosure problem is ebbing probably not the data may reflect several developments aimed at reducing foreclosures including new state and municipal laws that put a temporary moratorium on foreclosures such laws are designed to give homeowners more time to work with their lenders and modify troubled loans some cynics say the laws are designed to give the appearance that the housing crisis is easing ahead of the november elections
3966215 its absurd to argue that ending the moratorium on drilling off parts of the u s coasts would quickly bring down the high price of gasoline this chimera is being touted by president george w bush and other republican politicians including the partys presumptive presidential nominee senator john mccain of arizona to deflect blame for what its costing for a fill up to get around the fact that it would be a decade or more before any oil would be likely to flow a few partisan analysts have said that the cost of gasoline would fall right away they argue that the prospect of additional oil supply in the future would lead oil companies to produce more oil immediately because they would expect prices for crude to be lower later on well wouldnt that depend on whether a producer had the capacity to pump more oil today and whether it thought lifting the moratorium would add a significant amount of oil to future supply relative to future demand there are good reasons to question whether another 1 million or 2 million barrels of crude a day would make much difference in prices when world consumption is running at 85 million barrels a day about a fourth of all u s oil production is already coming from offshore wells primarily in the central and western portions of the gulf of mexico that arent covered by the moratorium

3966221 there was little hope of escaping a career in the world of words being born as i was to a couple of journalists who both also loved to read the pull was strong enough to sweep in not just me but also my sister marion

3966233 the health certificate was rejected as they felt it was discriminating against the models
3966234 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3966235 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3966236 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3966237 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3966238 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3966239 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3966240 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3966241 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3966242 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3966243 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3966244 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3966245 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3966246 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3966247 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3966248 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3966249 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3966250 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3966251 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3966252 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3966253 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3966254 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3966255 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3966256 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3966257 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3966258 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3966259 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3966260 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3966261 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3966262 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3966263 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3966264 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3966265 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3966266 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3966267 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3966268 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3966269 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3966270 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3966271 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3966272 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3966273 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3966274 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3966275 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3966276 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3966277 who are open to doing something on the production side
3966278 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3966279 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3966280 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3966281 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3966282 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3966283 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3966284 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3966285 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3966286 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3966287 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3966288 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3966289 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3966290 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3966291 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3966292 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3966293 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3966294 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3966295 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3966296 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3966297 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3966298 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3966299 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3966300 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3966301 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3966302 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3966303 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3966304 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3966305 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3966306 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3966307 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3966308 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3966309 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3966310 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3966311 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3966312 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3966313 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3966314 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3966315 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3966316 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3966317 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3966318 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

3966326 fue muy positivo puesto que hemos podido dialogar las tres partes y ya hemos alcanzado una soluci n concreta a esta problem tica
3966327 es realmente bueno que tanto el concejo deliberante como el ejecutivo municipal este caso a trav s del secretario julio bogado podamos realizar gestiones y acciones en conjunto que brinden soluciones concretas a los vecinos en este caso particular a los integrantes del cepet
3966328 esta problem tica que hab a presentado tiene que ver con el conflicto del tr nsito en el sector del gimnasio del cepet puesto que el mismo queda ubicado entre dos arterias muy importantes y transitadas como lo son las calles almafuerte belgrano y piedrabuena
3966329 a esta situaci n conflictiva de la ubicaci n del gimnasio se le debe sumar que frente al lugar hay un galp n que pertenece a una empresa de camiones de gran porte y adem s en la esquina hay una distribuidora lo que hace a n m s engorroso y peligroso el tr fico
3966330 era fundamental que podamos avanzar y encontrar una soluci n puesto que el gimnasio e la instituci n educativa funciona desde las 8 de la ma ana hasta las 21 horas y en esos horarios durante toda la semana circulan m s de 3000 ni os y adolescentes lo cual hace muy riesgoso mantener esta situaci n como est en este momento y no establecer otra forma de estacionar
3966331 si nosotros analiz ramos que en este gimnasio en su contexto y sumamos la peligrosidad del tr nsito nos dar amos cuenta que es imprescindible modificar el sistema de estacionamiento all ya que a la gran cantidad de ni os que concurren le debemos sumar los veh culos de los padres que llegan hasta el lugar durante toda la jornada para buscar a sus ni os
3966332 por un lado desde el concejo vamos a impulsar un nuevo proyecto de ordenanza a trav s del cual se establezca la construcci n en el frente del gimnasio de una amplia d rsena de entrada y salida la cual deber ser apta para el ascenso y descenso de las personas
3966333 como hemos visto que con esta nica medida no se podr solucionar definitivamente esta cuesti n es que tambi n impulsaremos en la misma norma el dise o y la construcci n de una darse m s amplia de estacionamiento transitorio y de seguridad la cual ser similar a la realizada en la calle viedma

3966367 the white house is trying to prevent the environmental protection agency from publishing a document that could become the legal roadmap for regulating greenhouse gas emissions in the u s said people close to the matter the fight over the document is the latest development in a long running conflict between the epa and the white house over climate change policy it will likely intensify ongoing congressional investigations into the bush administrations involvement in the agencys policymaking the draft document which has been viewed by the wall street journal outlines how the government under the clean air act could regulate greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources such as cars trucks trains planes and boats and from stationary sources such as power stations chemical plants and refineries the document is based on a multimillion dollar study conducted over two years the white houses office of management and budget has asked the epa to delete sections of the document that say such emissions endanger public welfare say how those gases could be regulated and show an analysis of the cost of regulating greenhouse gases in the u s and other countries the omb instead wants the document to show that the clean air act is flawed and that greenhouse gas regulations should be developed under new legislation several people close to the matter said the epa needs to clear a final draft with the white house in order to release the document

3966441 israel always controversial is now commonly talked about as if it were a pariah state
3966442 the result of this approach is that there is almost nothing on the news about the history or origins of the conflict and viewers are extraordinarily confused

3966447 it is israel that for many years now has been fighting americas war the democratic worlds war for many years israel has faced almost daily attack from the same sort of people who attacked the world trade centre indeed perhaps from the hijackers themselves what these extremists hate about israel is not its appropriation of a tiny sliver of arab land it is the sitting of a western style non islamic democracy in the middle east

3966451 the twin towers trail leads to saddam by daniel finkelstein the times 3rd october 2001
3966452 while we may be confident that osama bin laden was involved in the latest world trade centre attack we cannot be remotely confident that he and his network acted alone an attack of this complexity would have required active state sponsorship this leads to the second point the most dangerous state sponsor of terror is saddam hussein the secretary of state colin powell is right to contemplate a new war against him
3966453 from the moment that the first of the 1993 bombers a palestinian with links to the plo was arrested idiotically attempting to reclaim the deposit on the rented van he had blown up the fbi seemed convinced that this was merely a criminal matter since then the extraordinary investigative efforts of laurie mylroie an american academic have strongly suggested otherwise
3966454 mylroie argues that the original plot was infiltrated by iraqi agents who later disappeared leaving the naive organisers to shoulder the blame her most important contribution has been to trace the movements of one agent ramzi yousef from his entry into america until his arrest almost two years after the bombing giving in to such pressure would be to repeat historys mistake even the author of the powell doctrine himself may be ready to agree whatever its role in the latest atrocity iraq is clearly a sponsor of international terrorism the evidence that it is assembling biological chemical and other weapons of mass destruction is overwhelming its willingness to invade its neighbours and lay waste to countries is already proven
3966455 it explains for instance what the former cia director james woolsey was doing last month tramping round a college in swansea woolsey believes that iraqi intelligence organised the 1993 world trade centre attack a man calling himself ramzi yousef has been jailed for the crime and woolsey wants to prove that he is an iraqi agent in court yousefs claim that he was abdul basit karim a kuwaiti who had studied in swansea was accepted by most no one cared much who he was as long as he was found guilty
3966456 most theories closely tying yousef to the government of iraq tend to involve an amount of misdirection and arcane identity switching thats extreme even by the labyrinthine standards of international terrorism the connection has never been proven
3966457 at critical times he provided crucial support for a project that is inherently difficult
3966458 saddam hussein is a murderer for whom human life means nothing that he is determined to build weapons of mass destruction and has come close to doing so and that he harbours terrorists who conspired to destroy the world trade centre they also show that while saddam is cunning and driven we have been pathetically weak and naive in our dealings with him in other words they show that i may be deeply concerned about saddam but im not bonkers

3966469 over the years intelsat has provided us the ideal satellite galaxy 23 which serves our affiliates well we are pleased to be both extending our current relationship and expanding with additional capacity
3966470 olympusat will continue to deliver top programming options to the video provider industry through a combination of standard and high definition linear programming in our core categories and through more top network additions
3966471 one of the biggest trends in programming is the need to distribute regional programming internationally intelsats global network provides a single efficient platform for distribution into valuable video neighborhoods around the world
3966472 with respect to north america intelsats galaxy satellites offer seamless and effective transmissions allowing our customers to quickly expand into the highly competitive u s cable and satellite market
3966473 this activity is not related to either our geoeye 1 satellite or to the boosters readiness the geoeye 1 spacecraft has successfully completed all of its pre launch checkouts prior to being mated to the booster which is now expected to happen the third week of august

3966477 spacedev is playing a key role in the development of the commercial utilization of space and i am honored to be able to contribute to that mission by being a part of the spacedev team
3966478 the sensors available at that time were no good for space systems because they were big quite heavy and used a lot of heating power
3966479 so we had to develop a new type of miniaturized sensor to measure re entry conditions for spacecraft the sensors had to be very small and capable of measuring oxygen at high altitudes and during re entry
3966480 it is very easy to find terrestrial applications for this miniaturized gas sensor the sensor reacts very fast and this is useful in many cases where you need to measure ambient conditions on earth
3966481 one application where the sensor is particularly useful is measurement of the human breath with this sensor we can measure oxygen carbon dioxide and the flow of human breath and obtain the results immediately something which is impossible with the conventional systems
3966482 the sensor works well with combustible gasses and can be used to optimise the burners in industrial plants and home heating systems if you place the sensor in the exhaust gases you can control the heaters in real time by using a special algorithm and ensure that the burner operates at an optimum level
3966483 this system can reduce the exhaust gases that are harmful for the environment and at the same time by ensuring the heating system works at an optimum level it can also reduce fuel consumption by about 10 to 15
3966484 we will see more technology spinning back into space in the future
3966485 intelsats galaxy neighborhood footprint offers us the highly reliable distribution we need for our national and local programming enabling us to reach even the most remote communities
3966486 the services of intelsats galaxy satellites provide a secure platform to support current operations of the public radio satellite system and the increased capacity in our new agreement enables public radio to expand significantly the scope of its services to the american public
3966487 nprs reliance on this vast satellite enabled distribution network has supported the organizations evolution to a leading comprehensive source of national and international news
3966488 customers such as npr benefit from the scale and flexibility of intelsats global network delivering seamless multi satellite solutions for our customers protects their services and assists them in expanding their offerings

3966544 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3966545 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3966546 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3966547 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3966548 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3966549 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3966550 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3966551 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3966554 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3966555 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3966564 he was a brave soldier who made the greatest sacrifice anyone could make for everyone elses freedom
3966565 he realized that by being over there he was going to make a difference in the lives of those people
3966566 he always looked out for the other guy never thought of himself he volunteered to go to c co before our first deployment so that one of the guys from our platoon didnt have to deploy early and would have a chance to marry his fiance thats koch for you always looking out for his buddies
3966567 he had no problem he was dedicated to the fact that people over there needed help he was always concerned about other people he loved children he was a nice soft hearted kid
3966568 there is a subtle shift in sentiment going on with the market not getting out of control on days when we have bad news
3966569 my daughter and i thought it was rather inappropriate for a 7 year old to be wearing them dive in was written across them
3966570 well without being rude we thought it was rather suggestive
3966571 i think it is inappropriate because you just never know who could be out and about and see that and just think it was a bit too enticing for a young child to be wearing
3966572 i would like to see all the products removed from the shelves
3966573 a worrying trend of inappropriate clothing marketed for young children
3966574 the sensors available at that time were no good for space systems because they were big quite heavy and used a lot of heating power
3966575 so we had to develop a new type of miniaturized sensor to measure re entry conditions for spacecraft the sensors had to be very small and capable of measuring oxygen at high altitudes and during re entry
3966576 it is very easy to find terrestrial applications for this miniaturized gas sensor the sensor reacts very fast and this is useful in many cases where you need to measure ambient conditions on earth
3966577 one application where the sensor is particularly useful is measurement of the human breath with this sensor we can measure oxygen carbon dioxide and the flow of human breath and obtain the results immediately something which is impossible with the conventional systems
3966578 the sensor works well with combustible gasses and can be used to optimise the burners in industrial plants and home heating systems if you place the sensor in the exhaust gases you can control the heaters in real time by using a special algorithm and ensure that the burner operates at an optimum level
3966579 this system can reduce the exhaust gases that are harmful for the environment and at the same time by ensuring the heating system works at an optimum level it can also reduce fuel consumption by about 10 to 15
3966580 we will see more technology spinning back into space in the future

3966594 the government is afraid of possible bad influences on people who are here for the olympics
3966595 people can protest as long as they follow the procedure and do not break the law
3966596 they were here to do business not to attack the olympics
3966597 the worlds opinion was increasingly becoming skeptical about organized terrorism so the government is trying to prove that it is a real threat
3966598 look mom we found another one in the trash in our bathroom

3966602 i am completely afraid of the dark sooooooooo im going to need to fall asleep with the lights on
3966603 its a trick you see i figured out that on this side i can just keep reading using the closet light
3966604 so you turn off your reading light but keep reading with the light from the closet
3966605 and who is it exactly you are tricking with this change around
3966606 so why should she be sitting here moping about some stupid boy when she could be starting wars like helen of troy that sounds like a fun career choice huh vicki

3966608 reported having tightened their lending standards and terms on all major loan categories over the previous three months the federal reserve observed this week in a survey of loan officers
3966609 when the fed started to cut rates 11 months ago mortgage rates and other rates were actually lower than they are today
3966610 to say that things are easier in many areas of credit would be mistaken higher credit costs have eaten into consumer spending particularly in car sales directly contributing to julys sharp decline
3966611 there may be numbers of banks and other financial institutions that at the edge of defaulting will end up being bailed out by governments
3966612 coalition leadership will present a charge sheet against general musharraf
3966613 negotiations are going on for a safe exit to be given to him musharraf i think the americans and the army are demanding he be given safe passage impeachment would mean a huge distraction from the war on terror
3966614 we have consistently said the internal politics of pakistan are an issue for the pakistani people to decide
3966615 power struggle between pro and anti musharraf forces could push nuclear armed pakistan into a protracted turmoil prevent its shaky civilian government from moving against militants hiding in fata and even jeopardise vital us supply lines through pakistan to afghanistan
3966616 french soldiers were involved in assassination of tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french soldiers committed many rapes against tutsi women survivors these sexual abuses particularly targeting tutsi women survivors were systematic in other words frequent tolerated and a product of the standards and practices of the institution to which the men who committed them belonged
3966617 french troops adopted a scorched earth policy they ordered local authorities in the three prefectures of cyangugu kibuye and gikongoro to encourage the hutu population to flee simultaneously to zaire en masse they also clearly requested to have tutsi who had infiltrated the displaced population camps brought to them and to have interahamwe kill at least some of them at different places in the three prefectures they let interahamwe kill tutsi under their eyes
3966618 during the genocide at the end of june 1994 the french arrived at nyarushishi where they installed their positions all around the nyarushishi camp there were roadblocks kept by interahamwe and policemen to come to nyarushishi the french had to cross the roadblocks one day three youths were found in a tea plantation by the interahamwe and ran towards the camp pursued by the interahamwe they even managed to enter the nyarushishi camp the police commandant came in and took them away the french were watching and did nothing we never saw the three youths again
3966619 we also killed tutsis who left camps to look for firewood including sembebas son charles after killing them we threw them in a mass grave near the roadblock french troops came to see what we were doing and said we were real military men as a reward they offered us combat rations they also came along on our night patrols
3966620 this is a report of inquiry it is not a criminal file it is not a statement of guilt but on the basis of this report other things can follow we do not want to use this report as a comprehensive statement of guilt
3966621 in the last several years we have seen an insidious attempt to rewrite history this attempt seeks to transform france from an engaged actor into an accomplice to genocide it is an unacceptable falsification
3966622 france is still as determined as ever to build a new relationship with rwanda transcending this difficult past
3966623 everyone has received the word dont make waves summer vacation has allowed the french authorities to do as little as possible and franco rwandan news will be diluted by the beijing olympics the executive has decided that the quai dorsay foreign ministry will give the only official reaction in its daily press briefing
3966624 we dont want to give the impression were taking the report too seriously to avoid starting a polemic
3966625 frances strong desire for reconciliation and also its concern to face up to the weaknesses and errors of the international community including france in the face of the rwandan genocide
3966626 president dmitry medvedev asked me to tell you that the development and strengthening of the strategic partnership and cooperation with china is our foreign policy priority the new edition of the russian foreign policy concept which was recently approved by president medvedev made a point of it
3966627 russia will expand the russian chinese strategic partnership in all areas based on shared basic fundamental approaches to key issues of world politics
3966628 chinas claims go far beyond the tarabarov island or the bolshoi ussuriysky island chinas claims concern the entire treaty which defined the russian far east in the second half of the nineteenth century therefore by giving in now we are giving china an opportunity to put forward ever expanding claims
3966629 in the days ahead we will use us aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
3966630 to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communications and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
3966631 you have heard the statement by the us president that the united states is starting a military humanitarian operation in georgia
3966632 it means that georgian ports and airports will be taken under the control of the us defense ministry
3966633 continue our efforts to rally the free world in defense of a free georgia
3966634 reshaping us policy toward russia will take longer than the months between now and january 20 when a new president takes office but mr bush can at least atone for his earlier misjudgments about mr putin and steer policy in a new direction that his successor would have to deal with
3966635 i cant see any reason why it cant be funded on the national health service if its a case of living or dying the only thing that will help me is the sutent its like manslaughter because if i cant get this i will die
3966636 the decisions nice has to make are some of the hardest in public life nhs resources are not limitless and nice has to decide what treatments represent best value to the patient as well as the nhs although these treatments are clinically effective regrettably the cost to the nhs is such that they are not a cost effective use of nhs resources bevacizumab sorafenib sunitinib or temsirolimus have the potential to extend progression free survival by five to six months but at a cost of 20 000 35 000 per patient per year
3966637 other patients would lose out on treatments that are both clinically and cost effective
3966638 we plough billions into cancer research but the benefits of that research some remarkable drug treatments are not available to all who need them patients are disregarded and given up on because they cannot get the drugs they need
3966639 the possibility that we clinicians may be prevented from offering sutent to our patients is an outrage and a devastating blow to the kidney cancer community
3966640 if this draft guidance is not overturned there will be no point in me accepting referrals of patients with metastatic renal cell cancer as three quarters of patients do not gain any real benefit from interferon leaving only the option of palliative care
3966641 this decision will mean that the uk will have the poorest survival figures for metastatic renal cell cancer in europe sutent produces a remarkable effect on survival for patients it is now no longer ethical or reasonable for patients to have access to treatment with only interferon
3966642 there is a powerful human impulse known as the rule of rescue to attempt to help an identifiable person whose life is in danger no matter how much it costs
3966643 when there are limited resources for healthcare applying the rule of rescue may mean that other people will not be able to have the care or treatment they need
3966644 efficient distribution of resources but sometimes at the expense of fairness it can allow the interests of minorities to be overridden by the majority and it may not help in eradicating health inequalities
3966645 healthcare resources to allow each individual to have a fair share of the opportunities available as far as is possible it allows an adequate but not necessarily maximum level of healthcare but raises questions as to what is fair but an egalitarian approach cannot be fully applied when there are limits on resources
3966646 nhs is funded from general taxation and it is right that uk citizens have the opportunity to be involved in the decisions about how the nhss limited resources should be allocated
3966647 that allows just one trade union to set the pace in the realm of wage deals
3966648 only at the end of the peace obligations and only when there is no other means of obtaining an agreement
3966649 crude has regained some of its losses over the past few trading sessions reacting to the inventory report which showed very substantial stock draws in gasoline
3966650 concerns about the us economy and now the spread of the economic slowdown to europe and asia could push crude oil pricing to test lower lows because some of the supply issues have been discounted by the market
3966651 the supply issues should really become relevant again at some point and this is likely to backstop the drop in oil pricing
3966652 these issues have not disappeared they have simply been discounted
3966653 there are not that many factors that can drive prices higher
3966654 the conflict in georgia does not have that much impact the pipeline was already offline
3966655 been on me it feels like since ive been able to dribble a basketball
3966656 2003 is considered the 21st century quick history lesson thats when we invaded iraq just clarifying because you just looked really dumb
3966657 in the 21st century one nation does not invade another nation with the intent of overthrowing the ruling government
3966658 look what he did he smeared all over the place
3966659 you are taking a massive step to declare to the world that you are going to become an independent successful person whether the rest of the world likes it or not
3966660 happiness does not heal but happiness protects against falling ill
3966661 the idea that there is a state called happiness and that we can dependably figure out what it feels like and how to measure it is extremely subversive
3966662 deep economy the wealth of communities and the durable future
3966663 it allows economists to start thinking about life in richer terms to stop asking what did you buy
3966664 for the time being we know that happiness fosters physical health but not precisely how
3966665 chronic unhappiness activates the fight flight response which is known to involve harmful effects in the long run such as higher blood pressure and a lower immune response
3966666 if we feel unhealthy we go to a medical general practitioner
3966667 if we feel unhappy there is no such generalist we have to guess
3966668 professional guidance for a happier life is unavailable as yet this is a remarkable market failure given the large number of people who feel they could be happier
3966669 at a start price of 99 cents and of course with no reserve
3966670 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for halloween perhaps
3966671 we let her know about the policy and instead shes now selling a photograph of the offending knickers
3966672 ebay does connect colorful buyers with colorful sellers and i wouldnt be surprised if someone did buy these items though i couldnt speculate on who would buy them or why
3966673 this is obviously very therapeutic for this woman and it must be a great channel for her views on cheating and the sanctity of marriage
3966674 into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century
3966675 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for the ceasefire for the pledge that it undertook
3966676 that will only serve to deepen the isolation into which russia is moving
3966677 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3966678 at least 72 hours prior to ships or aircraft crossing the ukrainian border
3966679 may demand that naval ships and aircraft of the black sea fleet leave
3966680 the innovation is aimed at creating serious difficulties for the practical activities of the fleet directly contradicting
3966681 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki the russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
3966682 we still have a lot of hurdles to go over but im encouraged
3966683 i know this has been a hardship on them for that i apologize
3966684 but this project will put sugar house back on the map
3966685 our goal is to keep the roads functioning and then do what we can
3966686 ensure that neither of these devices send traffic beyond this rate on this circuit
3966687 additional vcs on r4 dlcis 401 and 405 should equally share the remaining bandwidth of its t1 interface to the frame relay cloud
3966688 in order to allow voip traffic to be interleaved between larger data converstions ensure that the maximum time that it takes to transmit a packet across the frame relay network is 10ms
3966689 configure your network so that all voip traffic udp 16384 32767 coming from vlan 46 going out the frame relay circuit to r2 gets priority over data traffic
3966690 voip should be allocated a maximum of 192kbps during periods of congestion on this link
3966691 none of the victims did any provoking vilan and his cohorts did all the provoking all the victims were outnumbered all the encounters featured low blows i e unfair fighting by vilan and his cohorts
3966692 the next thing i heard was a lot of screaming it was hard to see and i knew i had been burned
3966693 had the ventilation been there perhaps the explosion wouldnt have occurred
3966694 what upsets me is a lack of responsibility and it doesnt seem like the issue is being addressed properly

3966698 i know ill get the jitters a little bit when i go out there because this is my first experience
3966699 it was a bad crisis for the world it required tough words but also a smart approach to call on the international community to step in and im very very happy that the senators request for a ceasefire has been complied with by president medvedev
3966700 coach from men to a real man this is for you
3966701 i expect not to know what to expect and how its going to be like

3966705 the xfx 9600gt xxx alpha dog edition provides a solid performance price card that easily fits into most gamer gamer budgets given its minimal power requirements and single slot cooler the 9600gt would be at home in the meekest oem computer or a mid range custom gaming computer the xfx 9600gt xxx alpha dog edition is definitely not the fastest option available on the market but it is one of the better buys when you are trying to get the best bang for your buck if you are gaming at 1280x1024 i would highly recommend the 9600gt as a solid purchase that will hold strong for another 12 months with medium to high quality settings in current and upcoming titles

3966716 i am not a big fan of psu testing without very specialized equipment for testing cross loading voltage ripple and etc it is very hard to determine if a psu really is going to live up to its claims i feel that in the end i was able to devise a method for showing overall efficiency and performance with this testing method the ucp 1100 showed itself to be a very nice unit handling the power hungry dual xeon quad core system without breaking a sweat
3966717 it kind of makes you angry that a guy going about his business died
3966718 one minute he is going about his business and the next second hes dead

3966780 jesus said that we are to render to god the things that are gods and to caesar those that are caesars our caesar is a government of the people by the people and for the people in order for us to render to caesar the things that are due him we should indeed participate in our government our lord would have it so
3966781 the challenges of bringing these threats under control are enormously complex and will require fundamental changes in fisheries agricultural practices and the ways we obtain energy for everything we do

3966783 can you mix these leaves together ray wont keep still for his wounds to heal its like teaching a baby how to fly
3966784 sure i got a message from starpack yesterday violet came to me im sure of it she said that hard times were coming and that we should prepare for battle
3966785 violet queen has been missing for moons luck she was lost in the forest one day and we never saw her again
3966786 some wolves still dont trust her i dont for instance
3966787 what now youve been pestering me all day long and you wont rest what the heck is wrong with you today
3966788 okay you never would have thought a secret tunnel would be here in the camp right
3966789 i went to the straw pile to get some straw for the queens but there was no more so i went under the bushes where the usual growing moss would be i took a wrong turn and ended up there
3966790 no way this is something i wanted to share only with you
3966791 are you serious this could be an escape route in case theres a fire or some other emergency you want to hide it i cant believe this i thought you were smarter than this

3966793 nothing profits more than self esteem grounded on what is just and right
3966794 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
3966795 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3966796 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
3966797 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
3966798 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early
3966799 instructions are being developed and being sent to boards of election across the state to make sure voting is consistent
3966800 there is no question that the huge effort to register and turn out voters at ohio state university is going to have a positive impact on our race
3966801 california will go after people on their income and in turn those people may move their revenue and businesses nevada could be the beneficiary of that
3966802 im pretty confident im hitting the ball really well which is good tee to green im really well
3966803 im working on my putts a little bit i feel good about the way im swinging the club
3966804 im working the best to my ability to fix it you know and i think its improving its a step but its improving
3966805 i think everybody can enjoy it over here its not very long so you dont really need you know to hit driver every hole
3966806 a lot of guys coming over here its a tight enough golf course where you can enjoy it as well it requires attention and theres a lot of tricky holes out there its got a lot of variety
3966807 people need to be waking up to the realities of the world and that the days of easy money have come to a pretty sudden end
3966808 there is an awful lot of talk about big transfers and major demands of players but you will find throughout the uk and europe that money is not quite as easy to obtain as it used to be
3966809 were expecting the levels of transfer fees this summer to still to be quite high but probably not as high as the record that was set last summer
3966810 euro 2008 happened towards the start of the summer transfer window
3966811 the level of transfer activity at the start of a window sometimes decreases when there is a major tournament taking place
3966812 another factor is that the 2008 09 season is the second year of a three year broadcast deal and the level of broadcasting revenues to clubs this year will be broadly similar to what they received last year
3966813 so were not seeing a step change in the amount of revenues that clubs are getting year on year
3966814 another point is weve not seen anything like the number of changes in club ownership in the last 12 months compared to the previous 12 months
3966815 there arent several new owners of premier league clubs for whom this window is their first opportunity to buy and sell players so i think thats another factor

3966818 were trying to capture the diversity of this community to get their feedback
3966819 we wanted to make the case studies resource public and interactive hence a wiki its been really good for australia to have so much involvement upfront in the project
3966820 for every ton of cement we make we are sequestering half a ton of co2
3966821 we probably have the best carbon capture and storage technique there is by a long shot
3966822 we are turning co2 into carbonic acid and then making carbonate
3966823 a gas fired power plant is basically like attaching a jet engine to the ground
3966824 we use the waste heat of the flue gas theyre just shooting it up into the atmosphere anyway
3966825 we think since were making the cement out of co2 the more you use the better
3966826 make that wall five feet thick sequester co2 and be cooler in summer warmer in winter and more seismically stable or make a road twice as thick
3966827 it took pca about 25 years to get the standards changed to allow 5 percent limestone in the portland cement mix so things move kind of slowly
3966828 could you take this calcium carbonate and add it to portland cement you sure can
3966829 could you add it to the ready mix to replace some of the portland cement you probably can do that too
3966830 we are using emissions from gas fired generation as our co2 source at the pilot plant where we are making up to 10 tons a day
3966831 their proposed technology for capturing co2 from flue gases and turning it into a beneficial marketable product sounds very interesting to us
3966832 there are very good technologies for capturing the emissions of other pollutants the carbon issue is something we are just turning our attention to now and so far its been quite elusive
3966833 we started in my garage two years ago and were producing barrels today so things are moving pretty quickly
3966834 so these are bacteria that have been engineered to produce oil
3966835 they started off like regular lab bacteria that didnt produce oil but we took genes from nature we engineered them a bit and put them into this organism so that we can convert sugar to oil
3966836 if youve got something that you can make work in a test tube thats good but youve got to be able to make it work on a very large scale to have an impact on our petroleum imports
3966837 what weve done is make the same molecules from renewable sources so that it can go into the existing infrastructure be made domestically and in an environmentally friendly way thats the goal
3966838 you cant put ethanol in a pipeline and even your car needs some adjustments to it whereas the product were making is going into the existing system and thats a big difference
3966839 i doubt were going to completely eliminate our dependence on oil but well certainly be able to supplement the amount of oil we need in the short term
3966840 i think that the answer to reducing our petroleum import problem and reducing the carbon emissions from transportation is really threefold
3966841 it involves replacement fuels like biofuels it involves using much more efficient vehicles than we use today and it involves driving less
3966842 the fun of the challenge from the science perspective is that you do have farmers and biologists and entomologists and biochemists and chemical engineers and process engineers and business people and investors all working to solve this and it ranges anywhere from a political issue to a technical issue
3966843 honestly i couldnt think of a more exciting thing to work on as a scientist or technologist right now
3966844 part of the excitement comes from the fact that this is such a complex problem it cant be solved by a farmer or an ag expert and it cant be solved by a chemical engineer or a chemist
3966845 we all have to pool our various talents and training and try to come up with a whole new system of producing energy
3966846 and the current energy price environment has made literally everyone interested in replacements for petroleum
3966847 with well over 11 million copies of guitar hero rock band sold on the playstation consoles we see a tremendous opportunity in bringing starpex to market
3966848 never before have guitar hero rock band enthusiasts been able to shred with a hardwood handcrafted authentic guitar controller thats built with the look and feel of a real guitar this will change the way the games are played
3966849 dude you aint think i was going to notice that i have met almost everyone in your innercircle except for her
3966850 yeah hes you know ryan just he goes a little bit crazy on tour sometimes
3966851 we catholics find ourselves at a very interesting point in history once again presidential elections are upon us and we represent the largest bloc of religious voters at an estimated 25 of america s registered voting population therefore senators obama and mccain are out to get our votes
3966852 when they told me we get to throw out the first pitch i went to robin and said find me someone
3966853 were here to support ternyia shes a wonderful student and im glad to be here
3966854 she kept asking are we going to be able to do this
3966855 i had to be here to see it shes a delight to be around
3966856 if obamas candidacy represented nothing more than the spark for this profound initiative to unite the working class and defeat the pernicious influence of racism it would be a transformative candidacy that would advance progressive politics for the long term
3966857 what are you new around here the leftist are never satisfied the sun shines they wine a cloudy day they whine traffic whine clear roads whine republican whine democrat deny it ever happened a liberal voice is nothing but a spoiled child that doesnt appreciate the good in anything other then his own self hating guilt and its his mission to make sure everyone is as miserable as they are p s gt i have yet to meet one lock step republican rush has battered mcamnesty and bush as have all the other talking heads but find a post detrimental to the messiah dare ya then come back and talk to us till then step out of the purple haze
3966858 theres nothing to be necessarily alarmed about theres been open water at the pole before we have no clear evidence at this point that this is related to global climate change
3966859 a large body of ice free water about 10 miles long and 3 miles wide near the pole
3966860 the fact of having no ice at the pole is not so stunning
3966861 we see a tipping point occurring right before our eyes the arctic is the first tipping point and its occurring exactly the way we said it would
3966862 soot snow ice albedo climate forcing is not included in intergovernmental panel on climate change evaluations this forcing is unusually effective causing twice as much global warming as a co2 forcing of the same magnitude
3966863 in 1905 norwegian explorer roald amundsen became the first person to successfully navigate the northwest passage in a wooden sailboat
3966864 in fact so little ice has never before been noted the expedition all but established a record sailing as far north as 81 degrees in ice free water source
3966865 were certainly seeing some cooler temperatures associated with the dry south westerly airstream
3966866 theres still a bit of high cloud about but with the cloud clearing forward well probably see similar temperatures tomorrow as well
3966867 that means theres more onshore flow and it should increase the moisture in the air a little bit
3966868 the improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority as such for him scepticism is the highest of duties blind faith the one unpardonable sin
3966869 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
3966870 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
3966871 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child
3966872 the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane
3966873 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added

3966876 ive had a great time but the circuit is getting harder and harder
3966877 there are more tournaments more travelling it gets very tiring and expensive to keep up if you are an amateur and really you have to be in the top 10 to earn enough from the sport or sponsorship to make it
3966878 we have great control techniques but at the end of the day theyre so tall youre not going to get past
3966879 ian struggled in the first inning but after that he started to throw the ball well
3966880 ian is getting better but he still suffers from those lapses and they seem to come in the first inning once he gets through that first inning hes ok
3966881 when we send him out there we know we have a good chance to win
3966882 tetris wouldnt be released today in the casual games space unless it had a story mode about you working your way across the world looking for clues about your missing uncle one tetris round at a time
3966883 we are all so excited to be returning to trois rivieres
3966884 we love this place coming off last weeks win and coupled with the fact that we have always done well at trois rivieres makes for a great event we have four awesome drivers this weekend and are glad to have peter back with us the canadian fans are always so receptive to our form of racing and for some strange reason all the drivers and crew really all love this event i am sure the festive nightlife and pretty french canadian girls have nothing to do with it
3966885 lets not talk about that and just hope it continues
3966886 hes the greatest olympian in the world and hell be able to earn money everywhere as hes an international brand
3966887 hes a billion dollar man he wont have to get a job ever he can live off this for 50 years
3966888 in the heat and intensity of this event it may seem that his earning power is limitless but you have to pull back and look at someone like tiger woods who has performed at a top level for years and years in front of the world
3966889 the olympics is only held once every four years after a year to so americans forget about the olympics and move to stars they see more kids want someone else on their weetabix box
3966890 you need to be out there early and establish your affiliation with the property michael phelps
3966891 his performance here will benefit us as it will add to the visibility we will get through this affiliation and his earning ability will increase theres no question of that
3966892 in the short term he is a gold mine because he represents everything that is pure young strong and visionary about america we havent had anyone of this significance since mark spitz
3966893 guaranteed there will be marketers wanting a piece of him that make no sense and it will interesting to see how his handlers cope with this and if they get greedy because the olympics has a narrow avenue of marketability
3966894 and it was a polish guy who was the boss theyre always the worst
3966895 international iphone carriers start the apple pile on over sub par 3g
3966896 the answer is very simple look at the lifestyle and diet of african american women and you will have your answer it is highly acidic
3966897 this is really intended as a wake up call to show what could happen if nothing changes
3966898 over weight and obesity is a consequence of lifestyle and dietary choice when the body is unable to remove its own dietary and metabolic acids or waste products they are moved away from the organs that sustain life and parked in the fatty tissues this leads not only to obesity but to diabetes hypertension hypercholesterol and many cancerous conditions
3966899 the key to your healthy ideal weight free from all sickness and dis ease is to maintain the alkaline design of the body through an alkaline lifestyle and diet
3966900 this month back in 1968 for instance the sun reported that arlingtons maximum teacher salary for the coming school year would be 11 532 how does that relate to 2008 dollars well hopping on the internet i found an inflation calculator that converted that 11 532 to 72 941 in 2008 dollars full disclosure since i couldnt use 2008 on the converter i substituted 1967 for 1968 and then substituted 2007 for 2008 close enough for government and media work the maximum salary for teachers in the arlington school system today is well over 90 000 so it turns out that pay in the profession has outpaced inflation pretty well through the past 40 years at least at the top end if not at the bottom of the salary scale in the same edition i discovered that fairfax had set a salary of 6 700 for starting teachers in 1968 that converts to 42 378 in todays money starting teachers in fairfax earn a little more than that amount when they start today but not a whole lot more in that respect its mirrored a national trend those at the top take the elevator those at the bottom get the shaft
3966901 i didnt like seeing him walk off the mound assuming that he was going to get a call on a strike before the umpire signaled it he was wrong once or twice and hell pay for that sort of thing in the big leagues
3966902 don t get the walls dirty cleanliness is a great sign of civilization

3966905 anything is possible but you have to believe and you have to fight
3966906 the fear of suffering is often worse than the suffering itself
3966907 its only pain and its only suffering its not going to kill you and if its not going to kill you whats the big deal
3966908 i never saw a wild thing sorry for itself a small bird will drop frozen dead from a bough without ever having felt sorry for itself
3966909 it is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees
3966910 the strength of the pack is the wolf and the strength of the wolf is the pack
3966911 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat
3966912 somebody may beat me but they are going to have to bleed to do it
3966913 the will to win means nothing without the will to prepare
3966914 what we have is based upon moment to moment choices of what we do in each of those moments we choose we either take a risk and move toward what we want or we play it safe and choose comfort most of the people most of the time choose comfort in the end people either have excuses or experiences reasons or results buts or brilliance they either have what they wanted or they have a detailed list of all the rational reasons why not
3966915 as a man sows he shall reap and i know that talk is cheap so the hotter the battle is the sweeter the victory
3966916 you will be what you will to be let failure find its false content in that poor word environment but spirit scorns it and is free it masters time it conquers space it cows that boastful trickster chance and bids the tyrant circumstance uncrown and fill a servants place the human will that force unseen the offspring of a deathless soul can hew the way to any goal though walls of granite intervene be not impatient in delay but wait as one who understands when spirit rises and commands the gods are ready to obey the river seeking for the sea confronts the dam and precipice yet knows it cannot fail or miss you will be what you will to be

3967005 the comments by the reserve bank just reinforced the widely held opinion of the rate cut
3967006 the cloud of future rate cuts is plaguing the aussie dollar

3967025 eric was saying about why he was attracted to google imagine every day in your life working with 25 26 27 year olds whove got a fabulous idea who see no boundaries see no limits see no obstacle that they cant hurdle it is the most stimulating environment that you can ever be in
3967026 where i told somebody boy we just founded a company thats got three people in it and the total age of the company is 64 years old thats what sort of gets our collective blood gushing it is just an incredibly stimulating place to be and the moment you think youve seen it all or you think youve heard all the good ideas is the moment you begin to go out of business
3967027 there is something magical there clearly there are examples that disprove the rule and i wont be brash or brazen enough to repeat the typical line about what happens to people over the age of 30 and it always amuses me when at sequoia and at other venture firms im always worried about a founder whos in his or her mid 20s or late 20s and is running a company
3967028 its much easier to solve this problem by paying really low salaries all the right things occur and part of the reason that venture capital and these startups work so well is that the startups are incredibly cheap so if you see a startup thats busy hiring all these experienced senior people not in the age group that mikes talking about youve got to worry about that what you want is the people who are very low paid working themselves to death and all the right things happen

3967053 you do go out but not without watching your back
3967054 if that happened to a white person every church in this god n f ing town wouldnt do a god n thing about it
3967055 just because theyre f ing border jumpers and came over here
3967056 i cant say you know the mexicans came here and now theres problems
3967057 yeah obviously ive been here my whole life and ive never had a problem now theres problems
3967058 because itll set a precedent that they can do that to the mexican people

3967061 the u s dollar is no longer in our opinion is no longer seen as a stable currency and is devaluating all the time and thats putting troubles all the time

3967064 the appropriate role for the federal government is to move as quickly as it can to put in place the new industrial legislation and to urge all parties including telstra to live in the real world to recognise the fact that circumstances have changed and to act in good faith he said
3967065 telstra has not acted in an honest way they have sought to camouflage their intentions here
3967066 we want work choices to be got rid of as soon as possible mr lawrence said
3967067 but we also understand that the federal government has a complex task in dismantling work choices in putting in place a whole new industrial system it is a difficult task
3967068 where is the balance here where is the fairness he said
3967069 all we are asking is telstra to be open with us and its employees and put its cards on the table
3967070 of course we looked at the companys options if union negotiations broke down and they did mr barr said
3967071 of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia
3967072 let me make this very clear that any collective agreement would have nothing to do with awas or work choices and our employees would get to vote on it

3967077 they came in and worked so hard this summer what im most proud of is how they came in and competed they didnt want to sit back and say hey im going to take a year and redshirt
3967078 even if that happens theres nothing against a redshirt you want to come and compete and win a job if you dont win at least it makes the guy in front of you better
3967079 it was a very good outcome and well managed im sure that the teacher went through the normal safety processes beforehand
3967080 up until this point weve basically been in work groups
3967081 we were in work groups today after this scrimmage we have to start giving guys a role weve got to find where they can help
3967082 whatever the coaches decide to do is all right with me
3967083 im going to go have a beer you want a beer
3967084 in summary increased affluence and rapidly developing communications technology are compressing our expectation around time if the late twentieth century was about doing more with less then the twenty first century will be about doing more with less faster

3967112 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
3967113 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain

3967144 are planned at 8 5 billion this year 2008 and i think we will fully meet the plan and even exceed it
3967145 our foreign customers are queuing up for new russian made weaponry
3967146 among our main 10 15 customers are china india almost all middle east countries algeria morocco and venezuela
3967147 systems that will be bought later will be deployed in other areas depending on the threats encountered by the country
3967148 the army leadership realizes that weaponry such as the brahmos missiles will ensure victory to the country which posses it in any conflict
3967149 inevitable exclusion of substantial numbers of faithful anglicans from the church of england
3967150 different decisions should be respected and supported including that of those who have come to believe that fidelity to the faith we have received means that they can no longer remain within the communion of the church of england
3967151 we are faced with apparently irreconcilable differences in matters of faith and order and it is important to try to conduct all conversations and debates in a spirit of generosity even when church dividing issues are at stake
3967152 for the first time in my life i feel ashamed
3967153 we have talked for hours about how to give an honourable place for those who disagree
3967154 we have turned down almost every realistic opportunity for those who are opposed to flourish
3967155 all he told me was that higher headquarters wanted to be connected to the pilot for a mission the next day and he called the communications squadron because he couldnt think of anyone else to call
3967156 i terminated a network connection cable inside the headset coming from the wire harness and connected it to the conference call terminations on the circuit board inside a vosip phone
3967157 now we dont need to get on our keyboard to type our request or take our eyes off the screen
3967158 we can just talk to the caoc to receive clearance authority to engage a target or get other updates instead
3967159 with the phone people at the caoc are able to call us and use all the communications capabilities available there to feed us real time support through the headset
3967160 i never would have thought that a three star general would know what i did much less think so highly of it
3967161 we have a great opportunity to share tactics and training opportunities with the 961st aacs as we fly together over the republic of korea during the ore
3967162 the joint stars aircraft contributes in a lot of ways from developing targets of opportunity for attack operations to supporting personnel recovery operations
3967163 we use a crew normally consisting of 21 air force and army personnel to detect track report and target enemy ground movement while employing various radar modes computer subsystems and an extensive communications suite
3967164 when you start putting these two pictures together you get a lot of situational awareness of enemy activity for faster operational and tactical level decisions
3967165 though we both units have unique missions its the synergistic effect of combining the assets that makes the impact in the battle space
3967166 lcs is a transformational program it provides the first capability weve had to really be able to perform in littoral regions the way we believe were going to need to over the next many years given all the challenges that we see worldwide in littoral regions
3967167 this contract award is an important endorsement of the adaptive coded aperture imaging approach successfully demonstrated by the qinetiq goodrich team during the lacoste phase 1 programme
3967168 this award is an endorsement of the teams ability to deliver novel sensing technologies
3967169 our adaptive coded aperture imaging draws on several elements of qinetiqs rich technology base combining leading edge micro electro mechanical systems mems optical and sensor physics signal processing image recovery tracking techniques and systems engineering it is an example of a new wave of disruptive computational imaging systems that offer orders of magnitude improvement in mass size economy and performance when compared to conventional sensor technologies
3967170 this contract award is an important endorsement of the adaptive coded aperture imaging approach successfully demonstrated by the qinetiq goodrich team during the lacoste phase 1 programme this novel computational imaging approach has now demonstrated real potential as a disruptive technology for the isr market the goodrich isr systems business has a long history of offering world leading capabilities in real time electro optical systems in space and on manned and unmanned airborne platforms and is ideally placed to transition this capability into the isr market
3967171 they are very excited this is a capability that they dont have
3967172 they cant wait to give this a test run and hopefully it can save some lives and make their jobs a bit easier
3967173 you have to go through the process methodically all of the work will be worth it if even one life is saved
3967174 demands exceed the personal and social resources the individual is able to mobilize

3967185 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3967186 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3967187 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3967188 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3967189 i dont know but i sure dont like those who ask that question
3967190 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3967191 chen said was in fact seven year old yang peiyi who has a chubby face and uneven teeth
3967192 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3967193 chen said was in fact seven year old yang peiyi who has a chubby face and uneven teeth
3967194 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
3967195 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
3967196 but in the end the director thought her image was not the most appropriate because she was a little too old regrettably we had to let her go
3967197 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
3967198 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation
3967199 we should all understand it like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
3967200 especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
3967201 so we made the choice i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi after all we have a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show in our teams view all together
3967202 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer
3967203 i dont see there is anything wrong with it if everybody concerned agrees
3967204 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
3967205 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
3967206 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
3967207 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
3967208 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live
3967209 this girl has a great voice and they should recognize that she deserves to be seen she should definitely perform at the closing ceremonies
3967210 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
3967211 the right information has to be given to the people
3967212 yang peiyi missed out on selection to appear at the ceremony because of her external appearance it was for the national interest
3967213 i think there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic director picked the best voice and the best performer
3967214 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great
3967215 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
3967216 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
3967217 i dont agree with the decision because they are kids and it may scar them for life
3967218 i think the girl with the voice should have a chance to perform at the closing ceremonies it would be a great chance for her to redeem herself to the world
3967219 chens original interview was posted on beijing radios web site sunday night by tuesday the link was shut down the chinese government routinely blocks sites that are politically sensitive or that could cause embarrassment to the countrys communist rulers
3967220 you dont find many in the gang intervention world who can be effective in the street effective in the courtroom effective at city hall and effective in the prisons
3967221 he could calm everyone down and make us work together
3967222 we live in a world of useless information and every few minutes someone tips another bucket of it over us
3967223 the media are working so hard to be relevant pretty pathetic to see all that wasted energy directed against the most honest party leader and party in parliament
3967224 i guess you got to expect that when you are one of the most successful and influential foreign ministers on the planet
3967225 our country simply cannot afford to have insecure supply of electricity
3967226 alternate reality in which theres no such thing as climate change
3967227 national argues we need fossil fuel electricity generation in order to safeguard security of supply which is totally untrue
3967228 latest figures suggest that 1520mw of new generation will be commissioned over the next four years more than twice what is required to meet the increase in demand and most of which will be renewables
3967229 however we will not let the 90 percent target get in the way of security of supply we will continue to need the constant reliability of thermal generation

3967253 i am trying to make you people healthier you need to eat to live instead of living to eat look my body is a temple i dont put garbage in the temple of windu you understand garbage in garbage out you dont see garbage coming out of this temple

3967263 healthy people can have reasonably satisfying sexual health for most of their lives
3967264 there are challenges that arise but its not aging per se thats the issue a decline in sexuality may be the canary in the mineshaft sexual problems may manifest before
3967265 sexual health is a harbinger of physical and mental health and it plays an important role in the quality of life
3967266 older people dont just drop out of the picture in general if youre healthy you can be sexually active
3967267 dont assume that because youre older your sex life has to be gone if youre healthy and connected to someone and youve had a pretty good sex life when youre younger then you can have a pretty good sex life in old age
3967268 what we know is that if you see a very frail person next to somebody not so frail the very frail person is more likely to have alzheimers pathology in their brain when they die
3967269 this is important as we try to wrap our heads around the biology of aging
3967270 because it turns out that as you get older alzheimers pathology signs of its development are really ubiquitous even if that doesnt mean that you actually have dementia so this finding could alter the way most medical and non medical people conceptualize alzheimers as a disease simply of impaired memory and cognition while expanding our view of what it actually means to become frail
3967271 so now we put all this together and it raises the possibility that public health issue than previously thought if it turns out that being weak is a sign of its onset
3967272 but if so we also now have a clue as to how we can possibly intervene perhaps by treating motor dysfunction years before people develop dementia so that they wont develop dementia as early
3967273 this study really ties together two very common syndromes in aging cognitive processes and motor skills in ways i have not seen them connected before
3967274 so i think this is very important and relevant because it raises the question of whether frailty could be an early manifestation of
3967275 sorry i didnt bake you a cake for your birthday
3967276 not only can we manage very well without the interference of the capitalist class in the great industries of the country but that their interference is becoming more and more a nuisance

3967285 transfolks you and your issues are on the table but theres a limit were all quite comfortable including you in a hate crimes law after all thats easy to get done and it makes us look good thing is many of us are still not quite so sure we want to make the effort to actually fight for you and possibly expend valuable political capital on your behalf in order to protect you from discrimination in the workplace so were leaving ourselves a back door just in case we decide to chicken out again

3967292 russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and agreed to a provisional cease fire unfortunately were receiving reports of russian actions that are inconsistent with these statements
3967293 concerned about reports that russian units have taken up positions on the east side of the city of gori which allows them to block the east to west highway divide the country and threaten the capital of tbilisi
3967294 russian forces have entered and taken positions in the port city of poti

3967298 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
3967299 russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia
3967300 russias ongoing action raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3967301 the u s has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia this is a small neighbour of russia it is a country that has made a considerable progress in terms of the economy its still trying to secure its democratic institutions and weve worked with georgia on that but if any one has any doubt about our support for georgia you only have to look at the fact that georgia is a millennium challenge country which one of the most important designations u s can make we believe in the future if this country
3967302 no russian troops that are enforcing a peacekeeping operation in georgia have been sent to poti over the last few days russian troops have been operating near the towns of gori and sinaki its an open secret

3967304 to somehow suggest obama is supportive of gun owners because he says so when he is in montana running for president is absurd
3967305 we are going to make sure that anybody that tells montana gun owners that barack obama is not a threat to gun owners is exposed as someone who is not shooting straight
3967306 the nra is wrong to suggest we are misleading anybody
3967307 how could i have let myself be fooled like that
3967308 new york i love you but youre bringing me down
3967309 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
3967310 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3967311 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
3967312 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
3967313 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on and make sure their vote is cast early
3967314 instructions are being developed and being sent to boards of election across the state to make sure voting is consistent
3967315 there is no question that the huge effort to register and turn out voters at ohio state university is going to have a positive impact on our race

3967327 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
3967328 between one candidate who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
3967329 it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does after the election in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee

3967338 we are ahead of our business plan in terms of the numbers we said we would deliver to advertisers
3967339 there is a tremendous appetite for big event television of which the olympics is the biggest
3967340 our ratings for athens were up over sydney and sports in general seems immune to erosion in viewership and keeps bucking the trend a great example of that are some of the recent events on nbc like the stanley cup final wimbledon and u s open which all showed ratings increases

3967345 donors who died from cardiocirculatory causes offer an opportunity to reduce waiting time and waiting list mortality among children whose survival depends on a heart transplant
3967346 i dont know how you can ever have a patient that meets the criteria for irreversible loss of function and then reverse that function in someone else
3967347 if death means irreversible loss of cardiac function and that heart beats in someone elses chest its not irreversible is it
3967348 with such consent there is no harm or wrong done in retrieving vital organs before death providing that anesthesia is administered with proper safeguards no patient will die from vital organ donation who would not otherwise die as a result of the withdrawal of life support

3967356 its not the first research to show a correlation between talent management and financial results
3967357 but its one in a handful and i think it really adds to that body of evidence that is helping organizations to build a solid business case for investments in talent management

3967371 tubemogul who i just absolutely adore thats a great example of a great product and great people behind it if i had to upload episodes of abigail to 15 places at a time i would never leave the house but because of their fantastic product its a click of a button
3967372 this is the emerging of an entirely new industry thats going to be absolutely huge
3967373 it certainly within our lifetime will become the way of distribution i think its perfect timing
3967374 were constantly vigilant about who is coming into our office
3967375 but we dont want to be a closed off office
3967376 but obviously when a human situation like this occurs its not any longer about parties
3967377 they are staying there to neutralize the large arsenal of weapons and other military hardware in the areas of gori and senaki these arsenals remain unguarded apparently those who guarded them fled
3967378 aimed at ensuring the peace enforcement operation in respect to the georgian side which violates all of its obligations
3967379 russian tanks continue to ravage georgia town and villages killing people destroying buildings looting theyve been doing worse things to what ive heard in the past and i could never imagine happening in my country
3967380 we as the russian federation are sticking to the agreement which has been made in moscow yesterday and we hope that the other side will show its readiness to do the same
3967381 blaming again us for doing something which is contrary to the real situation
3967382 this is the kind of cease fire that i dont know they had with afghanistan i guess in 1979
3967383 there is no cease fire russian forces are moving around
3967384 not only those people who are committing all those atrocities are responsible but those who dont react to that i think they also share responsibility
3967385 there wasnt anything that occurred that she could be suing over
3967386 just a power of the wills it was very authoritative on both parts
3967387 you had a duty as the captain of this plane to call the police and you didnt do it
3967388 i looked at my hands and there was blood all over me i thought i did something bad but i wasnt sure what i did
3967389 i remember some things sometimes drugs make me have weird blackouts where i do things and dont have a recollection
3967390 i lied to them so i could get my visits
3967391 ive become numb to the fact that such a great evil and i could become so intimate to use sex as a weapon of choice to try and kill people is so inhumane so out of this world there is no punishment fit for his crimes
3967392 this man is a danger to the public and to women he deserves condemnation from this court
3967393 theres no remorse here he doesnt care that these women may have contracted hiv he preyed on these women because they loved him and he took advantage of it its unspeakable betrayal to these women
3967394 why would someone want to make a child ready to die
3967395 i now realize i have done nothing wrong other than loving and trusting this man
3967396 this is an accused who went to great lengths to cover up the fact he was hiv positive
3967397 he even had access to free condoms for godsakes but the man never bothered he did what he wanted to do for his own gratification it was selfish abhorrent behaviour he had a callous disregard for the health of his victims
3967398 republicans are just not the dominant force they used to be democrats have picked up seats both in dc and the state house we have a democratic governor and attorney general twenty years ago all this would have been unthinkable
3967399 theyre leaning democratic that bodes well for democratic chance here in arizona
3967400 if a change is going to happen itll happen in the hispanic vote mccain used to have that vote but that support is gone because in order to capture the nomination mccain sold them out he had to change his beliefs to appeal to the far right view on immigration and when he did that he abandoned his hispanic supporters and theres nothing he can do to bring that back
3967401 if mccain loses arizona itll be because he lost the hispanic vote
3967402 if mccain gets the nomination hes not getting my vote i dont trust him i dont like him i wont vote for him
3967403 but if that guy wins ill switch parties and vote for him instead
3967404 well at least it doesnt smell as bad as it used to

3967413 the reason and objective is to let others know the health condition of our father uncle brother friend and grandfather miguel
3967414 what do you think of the narco corridos that have been written about you
3967415 i felt an absolutely indescribable sense of menace it was hell on earth to be there in the presence of the entities and yet i couldnt move couldnt cry out couldnt get away id lay as still as death suffering inner agonies whatever was there seemed so monstrously ugly so filthy and dark and sinister of course they were demons they had to be and they were here and i couldnt get away
3967416 i have come to support less and less the idea that ufos are nuts and bolts spacecrafts from other worlds there are just too many things going against this theory to me it seems ridiculous that super intelligences would travel great distances to do relatively stupid things like stop cars collect soil samples and frighten people i think we must begin to re examine the evidence we must begin to look closer to home
3967417 if you object i ask you to explain quantitatively not qualitatively the reported phenomena of materialization and dematerialization of shape changes of the noiseless hovering in the earths gravitational field accelerations that for an appreciable mass require energy sources far beyond present capabilities even theoretical capabilities the well known and often reported e m sc electro magnetic interference effect the psychic effects on percipients including purported telepathic communications

3967420 my clients love the fact that i can stimulate their minds and their bodies
3967421 and i dont believe my education has been wasted in fact i usually take problem sheets with me to solve before appointments
3967422 people think escorting is sleazy and terrible but i dont see it like that
3967423 ive always had a high sex drive and now im getting all the sex i want and guys are much better in bed with an escort than a girlfriend
3967424 i have men who are thrilled about my passion for mathematics in fact one made me recite equations while he pleasured me then i gave him oral sex while he chatted about algebra it drove him wild
3967425 i have a nice life and i am in control
3967426 i hate this stereotype society has of escorts being exploited
3967427 my clients treat me like a princess one guy i see in london took me shopping on bond street he bought me a beautiful black gucci dress for 700 and then took me to selfridges and told me to pick any handbag i liked
3967428 later that night we went for dinner i wore my gucci dress and sexy lingerie and took great pleasure in peeling it off for him later on back at his hotel
3967429 i have studied so intensely for so many years i wanted to have fun
3967430 id read belle de jours diary of a london call girl and was fascinated
3967431 when this immaculate lady in a designer suit asked if i had ever considered escorting i found it appealing
3967432 i went home researched agencies on the internet and found one i thought looked professional i sent them photographs and they put me on their site
3967433 he was waiting for me at the bar of the hilton
3967434 he was only in his late 20s tall and handsome
3967435 id have been thrilled if he chatted me up in a bar we had a drink then went upstairs to his room and had fantastic sex i left that night feeling totally elated having had an amazing time with 250 in my purse
3967436 but i dont want that because im happy doing what i do now i wonder if i could go back to a normal relationship where you watch eastenders and have boring sex ive got used to being treated like a princess
3967437 as i grew older i began to clash with my father
3967438 from 11 i was studying maths all the time i didnt have any friends i wasnt in the brownies my father said they didnt teach muslim values i hardly ever played with other children
3967439 it was an amazing place but i was too young by the time i was 15 i wanted to be in control of my life i fought back
3967440 had enough of 15 years of physical and emotional abuse
3967441 i couldnt bear the thought of going home so i ran away id saved up 200 and found a hostel in london for 14 per night after a week i moved to a hostel in bournemouth i knew i could survive on my own
3967442 i stayed with two families who were very good to me my mum and dad would call me and ask me to go home but i didnt want to
3967443 at the time i thought we would be together forever but we married too young and grew apart
3967444 im still only young and i cant decide what i want to do
3967445 i still enjoy learning and i find it puts me in the right frame of mind for an intelligent conversation with my clients
3967446 at the end of the day you dont have to sleep with a client if you dont want to
3967447 the dullest client ive ever had was a rich man who talked about cars all night it was really really boring
3967448 i dont want to take anything away from people who do jobs like that but its not for me i have a nice life i dont want for anything
3967449 i was shaking when i found out what had become of her
3967450 i have contact with them occasionally but i couldnt speculate on what they will make of my new life
3967451 i dont have any regrets ive never felt more confident about my body and ive had some of the best sex of my life
3967452 im a person and i have the right to have my own biological child
3967453 if nancy could get pregnant i wouldnt be doing this

3967459 ive got exams coming up and im thinking oh my god
3967460 its always a surprise who you are going to meet
3967461 hes been back in prison for over five months and knows therell be no more teaching and any hope he had of gaining an income from the teaching method he had developed to a high degree of success is lost to him his reputation is destroyed

3967466 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3967467 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3967468 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3967469 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3967470 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3967471 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3967472 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3967473 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3967474 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3967475 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3967476 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3967477 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3967478 se han logrado muchos avances pero a n quedan muchos a os para obtener la invisibilidad total

3967485 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
3967486 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
3967487 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3967488 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3967489 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3967490 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3967491 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
3967492 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
3967493 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
3967494 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
3967495 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
3967496 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
3967497 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
3967498 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro

3967501 encuentro continental de pueblos y nacionalidades ind genas del abya yala
3967502 si usted fracasa fracasamos todos los ind genas del mundo
3967503 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos
3967504 celebrar n consultas y cooperar n de buena fe con los pueblos ind genas interesados por conducto de sus propias instituciones representativas a fin de obtener su consentimiento libre e informado antes de aprobar cualquier proyecto que afecte a sus tierras o territorios y otros recursos particularmente en relaci n con el desarrollo la utilizaci n o la explotaci n de recursos minerales h dricos o de otro tipo
3967505 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3967506 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3967507 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3967508 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3967509 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3967510 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3967511 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3967512 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3967513 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3967514 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3967515 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3967516 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3967517 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3967518 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
3967519 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3967520 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3967521 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3967522 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3967523 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3967524 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3967525 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3967526 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

3967529 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3967530 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios

3967532 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad

3967534 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3967535 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3967536 kick of the stilettos and fuck me in the backseat
3967537 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3967538 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3967539 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3967540 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3967541 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3967542 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3967543 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3967544 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3967545 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3967546 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3967547 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3967548 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3967549 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3967550 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3967551 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3967552 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3967553 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3967554 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3967555 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3967556 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3967557 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3967558 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3967559 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3967560 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3967561 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3967562 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3967563 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3967564 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3967565 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3967566 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3967567 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3967568 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3967569 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3967570 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3967571 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3967572 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3967573 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3967574 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3967575 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3967576 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3967577 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3967578 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3967579 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3967580 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3967581 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3967582 it is past time for the iraqis to take more responsibility for their own reconstruction with the iraqis sitting on a massive budget surplus we need to return american tax dollars to the u s treasury
3967583 the iraqis have the money to pay for reconstruction efforts and with the price of oil where it is today the united states should not be an atm for the iraqi government for the people of iraq this is a matter of self determination and self reliance for american taxpayers its a matter of fairness
3967584 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3967585 its our intention not to pass it on to parents or make students start paying fees its our intention to have have teachers exam what field trips are necessary for their instructional program and just schedule those
3967586 they can use webinars videostreaming go to websites they can ipod and download things i think technology is bringing wonderful things to our classroom
3967587 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3967588 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3967589 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3967590 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3967591 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3967592 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3967593 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3967594 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3967595 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3967596 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3967597 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3967598 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3967599 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3967600 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

3967613 hari ini kita semua berduka dengan wafatnya bapak haji muhammad soeharto presiden ri kedua karena sakit

3967615 penghormatan setinggi tingginya layak diberikan kepada pak harto sebagai satu dari putra terbaik bangsa yang amat besar jasanya kepada bangsa dan negara
3967616 ini baru wacana karena sampai saat ini kami belum menerima sk dari pemerintah sehingga belum melakukan sosialisasi
3967617 saya kira jika materi yang diujikan dalam unas lebih dari 3 bidang studi justru bisa membawa dampak positif dalam dunia pendidikan pasalnya selain tidak akan terjadi diskriminasi pelajaran sekolah bisa mengetahui sejauhmana kompetensi dasar lulusannya memang untuk mewujudkan hal itu bukan sesuatu yang mudah namun jika sosialisasi terkait dengan hal itu dilakukan sejak awal saya optimis berbagai persoalan yang muncul dalam pelaksanaan unas akan bisa diatasi
3967618 memang jika materi yang diunaskan lebih dari 3 bidang studi mau tidak mau sekolah harus bekerja keras untuk memenuhi target yang sudah ditentukan tapi bukan berarti hal itu harus disikapi secara berlebihan di samping tidak akan menyelesaikan masalah saat ini yang penting dan perlu segera dilakukan adalah kepastian terkait dengan hal itu segera disosialisasikan ke sekolah

3967621 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
3967622 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
3967623 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
3967624 it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does after the election in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee
3967625 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
3967626 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3967627 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
3967628 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
3967629 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early
3967630 instructions are being developed and being sent to boards of election across the state to make sure voting is consistent
3967631 there is no question that the huge effort to register and turn out voters at ohio state university is going to have a positive impact on our race
3967632 within about 24 hours they start sending out feelers to each other and making connections
3967633 within a week we get some spontaneous firings and brain like activity

3967663 one of the fundamental questions that neuroscientists are facing today is how we link the activity of individual neurons to the complex behaviours that we see in whole organisms and whole animals
3967664 this project gives us a really useful and unique opportunity to look at something that may exhibit whole behaviours but still remains closely tied to the activity of individual neurons
3967665 its not that elizabeth dole is too old its that after 40 years in washington shes too ineffective
3967666 dole should remember her own words from two years ago
3967667 when she said that voters should elect a candidate with fresh leadership over one whod been in government for 40 years
3967668 you look in maryland and youve got a fresh leadership here in michael steele in terms of wanting to really shake up washington and his opponent

3967679 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
3967680 it happened very casually he came by the house and i went off with him in his car and had sex
3967681 like a dagger going through my heart it hurt so bad
3967682 he casey thought she was just saying she was pregnant to get him back because at that point they were broken up once again he told me it wasnt true and not to worry
3967683 at no point did he say kelli shes pregnant we cant do this anymore its not right we would hang out and hook up have sex i dont know where jamie lynn thought he was he probably said he was just going out with the guys but really he was coming to be with me
3967684 he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop but even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally
3967685 i think that he is trapped when i see jamie lynn doing interviews and talking about how happy she is with casey it seems so fake shes trying to paint a pretty picture but its messy art

3967705 at a minimum we need to be matching percentages to where the epidemic is
3967706 a very easy population to fund its often more politically viable to fund programs for women and children and youth

3967754 this year we have a record number of students testing in california
3967755 at the same time their act scores improved more students are growing in college readiness in california
3967756 im taking the act because i might get a better score than on the sat
3967757 or i could turn both in and it might look better
3967758 we are certainly saying theres an awful lot of high school kids graduating without the skills they need to succeed in the first year of college
3967759 indicates that more of our students are reaching for a higher bar and making plans to go to college
3967760 this is another symptom of the achievement gap that is leaving too many of our students of color behind their peers
3967761 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3967762 gm crops are not to blame for climate change the industrialization of agriculture the spread of dysfunctional conurbations the salinization of australia or indeed any of the other crimes of which the prince appears to accuse them
3967763 while i admire prince charless commitment to environmental causes his lack of scientific understanding and his willingness to condemn millions of people to starvation in areas like sub saharan africa is absolutely bewildering
3967764 the army and security forces will not yield to attempts to terrorise them with attacks and crimes
3967765 i want someone who is going to represent this country all over the world for the next 10 20 years thats what im looking for i want somebody who is different and unique and i want to find somebody as good as amy winehouse id love to do that

3967779 theres no best practice or rule of thumb yet theres room for anyone to come in and become a dominant network
3967780 evolved in many ways we would not have predicted when we launched
3967781 when we appeared at demo and for the first several months we pursued a rather classic definition of a new type of site social media we found over the first several months from user feedback and users that the idea of having another profile another place for your identity beyond the main social networks was becoming burdensome users were feeling profile fatigue
3967782 we started to observe not just with peoplejam but also with other social media sites trying to drive connectivity around content and around lifestyle interests that we dont see any successes in the market
3967783 so we began to evolve the business to drive a different type of value proposition which is much more in the category of being a social utility weve developed to be a social utility for people interested in self improvement launched aug 4 as a component of our site that will be layered on top of the social media
3967784 exceeds us 11 billion annually and is growing at approximately 11 per year attracting an estimated 45 to 60 million adults with highly desirable purchasing power

3967788 amateurs train til they get it right professionals train til they never get it wrong
3967789 if we can get the right quality in then well pay especially in attacking positions
3967790 i would love to spend that sort of money 20 30m on a player attacking players are the difference in big games thats why the ronaldos robbie keanes and torreses are priceless if someone guarantess you 20 30 goals a season my god
3967791 its got to work both ways there needs to be respect from managers and coaches towards officials but the other way around too
3967792 im completely shocked i had no idea id do so well
3967793 but its not like i was studying all day every day
3967794 obviously in terms of value of money i want to look at the whole lecturing profile i want to make sure that the senior people in our universities who are the most professional who have the greatest experience and who can make a valuable contribution to students are actually in the classroom from time to time
3967795 they the colleges and universities are saying that they do not have adequate funds but i am looking at exactly what funds we have put into the third level sector
3967796 we have already increased funding by 25pc in three years that is an outstanding achievement but people have been critical of the hse and the amount of funding that has been put into the hse and have questioned exactly what has been attained from that funding
3967797 i as minister want to carry out an audit on the third level sector and i am going to have a look at a number of the institutions and to see how they are performing how the money is targeted and if we are getting the benefits from it
3967798 i also want to see that money is targeted towards students student services and social inclusion
3967799 a lack of forward planning had contributed to enrolment chaos in some schools
3967800 the only mention of school patrons who are after all the providers of education in the entire document is in a brief paragraph which seems to relegate them to the past and seems to consign their role in school ownership to history
3967801 a feasibility study has been commissioned by the houses of oireachtas on the establishment of a parliamentary tv channel
3967802 we are very excited to be bringing our technology together with trimarks we have been continually enhancing our software over the years and were certain that our standards of quality and performance will be an excellent complement to the trimark platform
3967803 a spontaneous loss of consciousness caused by insufficient blood to the brain
3967804 only what you hide is profound is true whence the power of base feelings
3967805 write books only if you are going to say in them the things you would never dare confide to anyone
3967806 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
3967807 programs such as the go red for women founded by the american heart association aha have made great strides in raising awareness of heart diseases impact on women but the message apparently has not made its way into hispanic communities
3967808 our research suggests that there is a real opportunity to target this key ethnic group with educational efforts that raise awareness and promote prevention strategies
3967809 the glow of nbcs olympics coverage ratings victory threatens to be sullied by reports that the beijing olympic committee and the network have been less than scrupulous in their presentation of the summer games
3967810 newsworthy cracks coming to light in the great wall of olympics coverage
3967811 some footage had been produced before the opening ceremony to provide theatrical effect
3967812 some of them were genuinely produced some maybe were used from previously recorded material
3967813 admirers of the olympics spectacular opening ceremony said it would be difficult to follow in the programs footsteps now it turns out the footsteps were fake
3967814 really right now theres not a driver thats getting around here any better in the 360 class
3967815 hes got a lot of experience at this track he knows how to drive it were doing a few things that are probably making it a little easier for him but were not perfect and were not right on with the car he makes up for it as a driver
3967816 we knew we could win races you dont expect nine in a year you expect a lot of good runs top fives just solid finishes but this is pretty amazing
3967817 you kind of come into the year hoping for the best
3967818 and as things progressed weve been pretty fast this year and weve had a lot of luck on our side we havent gotten in any trouble so we just kind of take each week as it comes and do our best
3967819 itd be neat to say you were in the same ranks as terry mccarl and compete with something like a win record
3967820 i dont have any expectations i just plan on being out here having fun every week and trying to keep doing what were doing
3967821 i think the way they practice and the way they play the game really answers that question for you
3967822 ideally youd like to have it yesterday but thats not the case so i think those questions will be answered based on how they play
3967823 he had some things he can learn from particularly in the defensive movement part of the game but i thought josh for being his first time out there hes off to a good start
3967824 its really just putting your other hand down and your other foot back
3967825 obviously the pass protection and your footwork with the run blocking changes a little bit last year i bounced around quite frequently and this year i stayed mostly to the right its a little bit different but i think as practice progressed so did my technique
3967826 in the long run when somebody gets hurt youve got guys that are ready to play because they have had reps
3967827 whoever they decide to put out there i know they feel that is the best group of guys
3967828 i think every year you make some pretty tough calls
3967829 i think this year there will be more of them and i think thats natural as you try to grow your core but i dont know one year is different than the next but they each present problems and difficulties especially at the final cutdown
3967830 certainly special teams is a huge factor toward the bottom of the 53
3967831 decisions you factor how youre going to suit up 45 man who can contribute the versatility of different guys which we try to have in all of our positions
3967832 if we need it this is the only day we can ask for it and results in our district are a little mixed there have been times we have been successful in general elections
3967833 at some point in the future we will need to deal with that
3967834 for the last 10 years plus the school district has been growing pretty rapidly in our district you need buildings were not asking for anything right now but will have to in the near future
3967835 this place is very nice its very comfortable its beautiful
3967836 all of the kids we brought up absolutely would not survive if they didnt come up here
3967837 i use the computer i watch tv and i eat
3967838 what started out as one child coming up here has turned into a pretty special project
3967839 after i had gone through the training and served for two years i just realized im not made for killing people and if people want to call me a coward than so be it
3967840 there were no weapons of mass destruction there were no links to al qaeda and the notion we were going to bring democracy was kind of shaky
3967841 i dont have any regrets because i think every soldier whos refused to fight in iraq has done the right thing by refusing to take innocent iraqi lives
3967842 jeff and sarah his wife are what youd call adventure vacationists theyve gone on many trips hiking trips in the rain forest in south america mali africa
3967843 he was telling us he was going to georgia and he had to explain to us where that was because we thought he was going to the great smoky mountains and he said no the caucasus mountains in georgia in the middle east
3967844 obviously when they started moving the troops and everything we were concerned about where they were moving the troops
3967845 jeff promised hed definitely be back for the playoffs which start august 25th so hell be here cheering at that time
3967846 i dont think theres any evidence the bubble is bursting
3967847 when you hear the word bubble about sioux falls our industries are widespread we have great financial medical service and labor industries
3967848 but they still feel very optimistic so i think the bubble is holding pretty firm
3967849 as far as my business is concerned i would say yes we are in an economic bubble because each month my business is showing steady growth each year showing steady growth and we just keep plugging along and getting better and better
3967850 people when theyre seeing their food costs go up fuel costs go up they really cant splurge on anything too major but when you can come in here and buy a really nice bag a really nice jacket its a manageable splurge
3967851 reversely when things are going really good on the coasts property values are increasing 20 percent a year we dont see that either
3967852 we saw on tv that the city of tsinkhvali was fully destroyed probably there are destructions in georgia this is a real humanitarian catastrophe for the people and of course we are disappointed with what happened there
3967853 the principle of territorial integrity was recognized by the whole world community in the documents adopted within the cis we all stand against separatism but complicated international issues should be solved in peaceful and negotiating way therefore we welcome that presidents of russia and georgia announced cease fire and set to talks we hope these negotiations will be fruitful and will not allow such bloodshed in future
3967854 we would like to increase trade turnover up to usd 1bln

3967860 he walked around an employee walked in did meet mr gwatney they introduced themselves at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times
3967861 the building manager who was confronted with a gun said he was white as a sheet with a gun in his left hand
3967862 he cocked the gun and pointed it at him and when our guy bolted he went down the stairs
3967863 officer fired several rounds to disable the vehicle and did disable a tire
3967864 it spun the vehicle around as the grant county sheriffs vehicle went by the subject came out of the car and fired two rounds
3967865 at that time the state police unit rammed his vehicle and other shots were fired by state police
3967866 the main complaints ive heard is that its fixed its rigged
3967867 id love for it to be true because that would be an incredible story
3967868 to claim the manager hiring was fixed without any proof is almost like the boy who cried wolf
3967869 this city does have some problems and someone could have a very legitimate complaint
3967870 but if they are always complaining without any facts the general population of springfield isnt going to listen to them
3967871 if we had not done the national search we would be opened up to questioning of our judgment
3967872 if people can present facts that prove the hiring was fixed ill be the first in line on my blog calling to vote council members out
3967873 squirrels chewing through cables or a mountain lion biting a pole
3967874 theres been no activity on the account since july 21st that was the last time i had to deal with these brain dead wastes of space theres no appointment
3967875 i spoke with a representative yesterday i didnt imagine it
3967876 the earliest appointment is for wednesday what time would be good
3967877 are you sure youre going to show up this time

3967879 t he state of a female after conception and until the termination of the gestation
3967880 the condition of having a developing embryo or fetus in the body after union of an oocyte and spermatozoon
3967881 i give the same advice to all the players to give the refs respect
3967882 theyre human theyve got the toughest job but it works both ways referees have got to understand that
3967883 my client has been subjected to ridiculous accusations and she feels hurt
3967884 tavey meanwhile plans to push forward with her efforts to be declared the kids legal guardian
3967885 the sooner we get ready for it the better prepared we are then well pray it wont happen
3967886 certainly at the birthplace trust we have people coming in especially women who say we are here to see hamlet and so we thought we would come and find out more about what its all about
3967887 i think the rsc is riding the crest of a wave with david tennant
3967888 the production is drawing in people from further afield than normal so people are spending more time in the town and going on the stratford trail
3967889 they are coming in for an evening show and spending the day and possibly overnight in town
3967890 the credit crunch has affected overseas tourists more so than in the uk
3967891 its not that us visitors are staying away completely its that they are not arriving in coachloads as they once did
3967892 but we are seeing a lot more local visitors exploring whats on their own doorsteps
3967893 it is difficult to measure the tennant effect because the rsc have had a number of record seasons in a row
3967894 but i would argue that as hamlet has been sold out since may this year that there is definitely a positive impact
3967895 a lot of people are not shakespeare fans but they are stratford fans
3967896 they come to see the river and the town of course we would like more visitors and we would like them to stay longer

3967912 voting by machine is difficult to understand for ordinary voters
3967913 the pre printed ballots are an improvement over previous system which required writing the name of the candidates this system still allows human intervention
3967914 caused counting delay and contributed to a confusing post election environment
3967915 about half of them have returned and we hope that the rest can go back to their homes the day after tomorrow
3967916 the automated elections are a success despite some untoward incidents arising primarily from ballot snatchings in some isolated areas the results remain
3967917 we have set a few firsts in the recent elections
3967918 the secretary general appeals for restraint protection of all civilians as well as access for the provision of speedy humanitarian assistance to the affected population

3967929 quando as linhas de nossas pipas se cruzaram pela primeira vez n s as atamos com n s e para finalmente voarem separadas tivemos que cort las
3967930 eu queria ver no escuro do mundo aonde est o que voc quer pra me transformar no que te agrada
3967931 embora meu amor viva em um lugar em que eu n o posso viver eu descobri que eu gosto da vida com esta solid o
3967932 esse foi um beijo de despedida que se d uma vez s na vida que explica tudo sem brigas e clareia o mais escuro dos dias
3967933 ela dan a e cai o modess pelo meio das pernas ela dan a e cai o modess pelo meio das pernas eu vou acabar com seu problema vou mudar o seu destino sou vendedor de absorvente feminino
3967934 we thought it was something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as somewhat loving never the less some of the european media did not see it this way anyone who would like to interpret this differently is absolutely confused
3967935 to me it was little clownish for our part to be doing that the sponsor insisted and insisted they pushed because theyre the people that pay the money it was just a bad idea to do that
3967936 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
3967937 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
3967938 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
3967939 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
3967940 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
3967941 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
3967942 in view of the recent firming up of interest rates we are in discussion with sbi caps on the cost of borrowings and related issues while the financial closure is expected in october we are expecting to ready the term sheet finalising the loan and equity components in the project in a month and approach the board for final approval tentatively in september
3967943 we are focused on commissioning the refinery by 2012 the idea is to let the ball start rolling before the loan finances start coming so that the project can be completed on time
3967944 we are delighted to enter into the joint venture with vnsteel and vicem and believe that this partnership is well placed to make the most of the tremendous growth potential vietnam possesses
3967945 we also appreciate the support we have got from the government of vietnam and the leaders of ha tinh province proving once again that vietnam is a cherished destination for serious foreign investors
3967946 i do understand there are a number of public companies that have transfer restrictions as part of their articles but its not very clear how enforceable those are
3967947 the shares or debentures and any interest therein of a company shall be freely transferable
3967948 while people were aware of rangarajan it was that one paragraph and that one line which was lying hidden somewhere and which has surfaced very strongly i think those agreements were dated people now who get into rofrs get in very clearly in a circumspection that it may not be enforceable and you see a lot of agreements or structuring now moving to alternate forms of trying to achieve the same thing
3967949 i create several events of notice and upon those events of notice its my option whether to exercise the call or not to exercise the call but the moment i exercise the call the impact is pretty much the same because now i have the right to take what would otherwise have been sold
3967950 the issue that arises isnt it typical of jvs to have these provisions and shouldnt you have provisions to enable jvs to have these matters in the agreement which is common
3967951 below the sanctuary in the fellowship hall a banner for slavery reparations proclaimed they owe us fliers recounted herbert daughtrys arrest a few weeks earlier as he led marchers protesting the not guilty verdict in the police killing of sean bell an unarmed black man his ministry has always combined consuming spirituality with black liberation theology the theology jeremiah wright invoked this spring to defend his controversial sermons and zealous political activism leah holds these forces within her
3967952 while the media hounded wright for his anti american rants and while presidential hopeful sen barack hussein obama divorced him as his personal pastor obamas head will be crowned by leah daughtry who ardently believes in the same marxist black liberation theology preached by wright
3967953 i see no reason why the court shouldnt act in accordance with the wishes of the parties judge emmett said
3967954 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3967955 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3967956 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3967957 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3967958 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3967959 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3967960 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3967961 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3967962 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3967963 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3967964 yes you made a blueberry pie and you remember the last time we had blueberry pie
3967965 yes i remember we took a picnic into the woods and thats when you said you wanted to join a nudist colony
3967966 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3967967 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3967968 i could feel my wifes hand but i couldnt see her i kept screaming for her
3967969 im going to get a sigh of relief when i get a chance to see my wife again
3967970 the generous gift from red development fills a critical need in lees summit providing child care services for our clients
3967971 there is no new law passed there is no new form its completely made up
3967972 this study should be enlightening and practice changing for doctors and patients alike
3967973 the figure will intensify the markets worry about an economic slowdown
3967974 things will improve a little after the olympic games as western countries place orders to prepare for christmas
3967975 we expect industrial production growth to be under continued pressures from these impacts especially in the next two months
3967976 there is a little more caution both around the world and in china compared with a few months ago the japanese economy seems to be slipping into recession and europe is spluttering so in that environment you can see how china would feel the fallout
3967977 but i think theres enough home grown momentum so that china on balance will be a welcome source of demand for the world economy
3967978 there wasnt anything that occurred that she could be suing over
3967979 just a power of the wills it was very authoritative on both parts
3967980 you had a duty as the captain of this plane to call the police and you didnt do it
3967981 loud and clear statement that things are getting better not worse
3967982 there are not that many factors that can drive prices higher
3967983 the conflict in georgia does not have that much impact the pipeline was already offline
3967984 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3967985 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
3967986 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3967987 we work very closely with local authorities we dont work anywhere where we are not wanted
3967988 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community to help the poverty hit afghan people
3967989 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
3967990 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001
3967991 cowardly attack yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent
3967992 i dont think thats an appropriat e question for a job interview
3967993 quien nos atendi fue claribel morales que vino a hacer su trabajo de prensa y cuando le planteamos nuestras preguntas ella dijo que lo est n estudiando y a nosotros eso nos suena como una respuesta negativa
3967994 en la segunda pregunta que le hicimos de si van a radicar cargos criminales basados en el informe de la investigaci n criminal de paseo caribe ella casi enmudeci no supo qu decir tartamude y la respuesta para nosotros es que no van a hacer nada
3967995 cuando no te contestan es porque la respuesta es no y el pueblo es inteligente y lo sabe y eso la historia se encarga de corroborarlo la misi n nuestra era saber las respuestas y nos la dieron cuando te contestan con ambig edad creyendo que usted es tonto uno sabe que la respuesta es no
3967996 la opci n que tiene el pueblo es la calle son manifestaciones masivas contundentes como la que hicimos el domingo y como otras que vendr n el pueblo tiene que indignarse y pararle aqu el caballo a cualquier pol tico hay que cuestionarles
3967997 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3967998 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3967999 he hopkins was not a preacher he was a man that was going to use whoever for whatever gain he could get out of life
3968000 he told us that she had died during child labor so when he did my wife started asking about her and all of a sudden hes gone just that quick hes gone walked away
3968001 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognised border
3968002 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3968003 were conserving gas were consolidating the number of vehicles coming into hanover so far so good
3968004 car sharing programs like zipcars are popular on campuses and in cities across the country
3968005 we hope that students will opt to use zipcars rather than bring a car to campus and that employees will leave their car at home and use zipcars for errands and short work trips

3968012 all those things result in lots of other mechanical parts and bits and pieces that have nothing to do with electrical energy
3968013 such that the vehicle is not just a battery on wheels
3968014 itll have a similar set of visual cues and some of the features that were on the concept car
3968015 the program has all of those same things built in were just doing them faster because we have to
3968016 its an entirely different technology its an entirely different powertrain layout its a huge step forward

3968020 joan fitz gerald didnt understand web 2 0 which is all about interaction not just sending e mails its what mark udall did so well it engages voters who want a conversation
3968021 the polis campaign did a magnificent effective job of getting their message out in the media
3968022 we did a tremendous job getting our message out and our members responded
3968023 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3968024 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3968025 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3968026 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3968027 we had always talked during the triple crown trail about wanting to end the season in the right way and thats in the breeders cup classic
3968028 there wasnt anything that occurred that she could be suing over
3968029 just a power of the wills it was very authoritative on both parts

3968031 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
3968032 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
3968033 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
3968034 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
3968035 and i think ridge is a great example of that
3968036 far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights you know a number of other issues

3968047 it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what
3968048 the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century
3968049 to show to russia that we can come to the aid of a european ally and that we can do it at will whenever and wherever we want
3968050 we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
3968051 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3968052 we were unhappy with the initial actions of the american officials because they were perceived by the russians as green lines basically but this one was very strong
3968053 we wont be protecting the airport or seaport but well certainly protect our assets if we need to
3968054 to continue our efforts to rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
3968055 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can invade its neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3968056 we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
3968057 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3968058 everybody is trying to figure out what do we do going forward
3968059 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
3968060 i didnt throw the ball that well this morning underthrew some throws
3968061 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
3968062 we only have two practices left before the game and we do monitor that stuff
3968063 you guys talked to him more than i did so i dont really know where he is with that
3968064 i wondered this morning when i got up what in the heck am i doing
3968065 the answer to that question is i love to play i hate to study at times i hate to practice but i love to play i know i need to study and i know i need to practice and i know how important it is that doesnt mean i have to like it the question i have to ask myself is am i willing to do that and the answer is yes
3968066 yeah there were discussions about me going elsewhere before i came here and all that i am happy to be here i really am its a lot different from what im used to did i ever think it would end up this way umm no but its not over yet and im excited
3968067 but i could go into a game and i think i could manage a game ok
3968068 i said look i heard youre not talking to the media
3968069 he said its not that its not that i obviously was joking on that i said look im not here to take chads spot or replace him or whatever it is what it is
3968070 i said this the other day i dont think ive ever beaten chad
3968071 a poster child of the extremist elitist gun control movement
3968072 to somehow suggest obama is supportive of gun owners because he says so when he is in montana running for president is absurd
3968073 we are going to make sure that anybody that tells montana gun owners that barack obama is not a threat to gun owners is exposed as someone who is not shooting straight
3968074 the nra is wrong to suggest we are misleading anybody
3968075 a better way to go meeting americas 21st century transportation challenges with modern public transit
3968076 we want campers to come and have a good experience and enjoy the park as a place to have a connection with nature and rest and relax
3968077 were not out there to shut down somebody with a glass of wine after 11 oclock
3968078 he was a hard worker very bright and a perfectionist
3968079 everyone remembers him as being very kindly and pastoral and an excellent teacher
3968080 he gave us practical advice that has resonated throughout my life
3968081 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
3968082 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
3968083 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
3968084 it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does after the election in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee
3968085 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
3968086 many market players were taking a break from active trading as they were unsure whether the currency should add to its big gains recently or whether it should go for a correction
3968087 a team of brain scientists and prominent magicians described how magic tricks both simple and spectacular take advantage of glitches in how the brain constructs a model of the outside world from moment to moment or what we think of as objective reality

3968100 tim and rob bring winning experience to the maple leafs coaching staff
3968101 in our view randy is one of the top coaches in the nhl
3968102 ein gigantisches experiment mit der natur und der ganzen menschheit das v llig schiefgegangen ist
3968103 der klassische weg um sicherzustellen dass es in der zukunft keine nahrungsmittel mehr gibt
3968104 es scheint mir zweckm ig dass eine weitergehende unterrichtung durch den zust ndien bundesminister der finanzen peer steinbr ck erfolgt
3968105 sie dr ngte darauf dass er eine gewaltverzichtserkl rung abzugeben habe
3968106 liam is really good the thing about liam is you havent heard the half of it if he could even be bothered to finish some of the songs he started honestly theyre amazing
3968107 but he suffers the curse of the gallaghers its like f ing hell cant finish it ive got demos of his at home with about 40 tunes which if he could be bothered would be amazing
3968108 i would love them unconditionally if they wanted to but i would just as soon they have a more normal childhood
3968109 i was shocked a little bit shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling but im sure my boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3968110 god has a way of taking something bad and turning it into something if this hadnt happened i would never have been able to get back with my daughter and have this relationship i have with these two little boys
3968111 i feel incredibly fortunate to have been given the opportunity to offer the world of givenchy haute couture to madonna the icon the artist the woman for whom i have so much respect and admiration
3968112 because shes welsh and she can sing not just because she is welsh id like to do something with her shes something special
3968113 im dealing with this every day its kind of bizarre youve got to laugh
3968114 it was incredible to see one of the worlds richest musicians going back to basics
3968115 they didnt seem to have a care in the world as they laughed and joked with each other
3968116 it was nearly 30 degrees but the heat didnt slow them down at all
3968117 they were like two teenagers on a first date it was really sweet
3968118 i finally sold that terrible ugly suit weve had so long
3968119 do you mean that ugly pink and blue double breasted thing
3968120 i thought wed never get rid of that monstrosity that had to be the ugliest suit weve ever had but tell me why is your hand bandaged
3968121 after i sold the guy that suit his guide dog bit me
3968122 now she has some kind of timescale for blakes release it has given her some focus she wants something to impress him with because he has accused her of just sitting around doing nothing while he has been serving time
3968123 no primeiro tempo fomos melhores mas no segundo n s voltamos ap ticos faltou vergonha na cara vibra o um monte de coisa
3968124 faltou mais concentra o no primeiro tempo fomos bem mas no segundo o vasco pressionou bastante e n o conseguimos controlar
3968125 the spiritual poverty of the western world is much greater than the physical poverty of our people
3968126 you in the west have millions of people who suffer such terrible loneliness and emptiness they feel unloved and unwanted these people are not hungry in the physical sense but they are in another way they know they need something more than money yet they dont know what it is
3968127 what they are missing really is a living relationship with god
3968128 to me any country which allows a thing like that to happen is the poorest
3968129 that is something you dont have much of in the west
3968130 ill give you an example of what happened to me recently i went out with my sisters in calcutta to seek out the sick and dying
3968131 she was more concerned to give to me than to receive from me
3968132 but what she did was so beautiful i have never seen a smile like that it was just perfect it was just a heavenly gift that woman was more concerned with me than i was with her
3968133 i gave another poor woman living on the streets a bowl of rice
3968134 the woman was obviously starving and she looked in wonder as i handed it to her
3968135 she told me it is so long since i have eaten
3968136 about one hour later she died but she did not say why hasnt god given me food to eat and why has my life been so bad
3968137 the torture of hunger and pain just finished her but she didnt blame anybody for it this is the greatness of our poor people
3968138 we owe a great debt of gratitude to those who are suffering so beautifully they teach us so much
3968139 we have sent word to clinics hospitals and police stations not to destroy babies but to send them to us and we will give them to families who want them
3968140 at birth we arrange for adoption also to foreign countries as well as in india
3968141 life is a god given gift and who has the right to destroy life
3968142 i believe abortion is a reason why there is so much trouble in the world today people have ceased loving god and they think they can do without him
3968143 im getting old now arent i but its a wonderful thing to be able to spend all those years doing something beautiful for god

3968146 rumors of a split were sparked when mayer traveled to cabo san lucas mexico without aniston
3968147 it is really a cooling off not this big dramatic breakup
3968148 he never ends things with a clean slate he likes to dwell on these relationships and sort everything out before saying goodbye for good
3968149 kashmiris will continue to agitate peacefully and we should not give indian oppressors any chance to use brute force
3968150 the curfew was the first imposed across the entire kashmir region in 18 years kashmir is divided between india and pakistan which have fought two of their three wars over the region and both claim it in its entirety

3968154 you never really know why somebody wants to be around you or if they do genuinely like you i wish everyone had a label on their forehead so you could automatically tell their intentions sometimes you just wish that no one wanted anything from you
3968155 hemos detectado en los ltimos d as que la presencia de patrullas policiales ha aumentado y queremos que esta labor de vigilancia se mantenga
3968156 i think with the last record there was more of an actual anticipation i guess because we already had a record and then everyone kind of wanted to hear what the next record was
3968157 dude this is the best record you guys have done
3968158 oh fuck you know this could be it this could be the one

3968166 los gremios y la pol tica estatal no nos dejaron gestionar
3968167 el principal escollo que nos impide continuar al frente de aerol neas es la actual conducci n sindical de los pilotos hasta que dichas personas no sean relevadas por otras que piensen m s en la empresa en sus pasajeros y en sus empleados aerol neas no tendr soluci n no tendr salida si no se evita que sean los gremios los que manejen la empresa

3968180 ten words that sound better when said by james earl jones
3968181 the same very boring stone tools for almost 2 million years
3968182 they dont just have to convince me that its safe they have to convince the players
3968183 we are forecasting player salaries to go up 15 per cent from where they were last year our price increase is about half the increase in the player salaries so its about seven and a half percent we went out the year before with a 12 per cent increase we are trying to be sensitive to not having these prices go up and up and up while recognizing we want the resources to put the best team we can on the ice
3968184 thats why sometimes you get a report that we are the highest priced team in the league because they go on every teams website and pick off the prices and we dont disclose the discount price
3968185 so were actually third and fourth in canada in most price categories because of the discount program for those season ticket holders and were actually the only team in canada doing that
3968186 all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
3968187 how can i take a natural conversation about common things and connect it to the gospel without it coming off like an abrupt topic change
3968188 even when the unrighteous escape justice in the courts god says he will not let sin go unpunished
3968189 my personal desire for vengeance is often quited by gods assurance of justice
3968190 in the end i find that though i am guilty of different sins i am just as guilty as
3968191 part of why i am so passionate about the development of authentic community is because of how the bible portrays the need for it
3968192 rather than being explained by a single factor an accumulation throughout life of many associated cultural personal and economic exposures is likely to underlie the risks for obesity and some elements of associated neurological function
3968193 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama

3968197 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
3968198 the campus site will be centrally located within our district boundaries all student and district activities will occur at the heart of our community
3968199 the interest rates were very low in the first half of the year but i had positioned the countys portfolio pretty well in 2007 so we could take advantage of the higher interest rates that would pay off in 2008
3968200 does he think he can make it work over there
3968201 what i cant hear you its loud as hell out here
3968202 and i didnt know what they were talking about something about packing or screening the well then digging a trench across the road and hooking it up to the house
3968203 they had to dig 300 feet and they dont even know if its going to work
3968204 thats what he told me and even then you wont be able to use it until you call one of the companies on this list the health department gave me somebody has to come test the water before you can use it
3968205 a boat is just a hole in the water you pour money into

3968212 if you buy real estate at the right price it doesnt matter when you buy the fundamental rule of any investment including real estate is to buy low and sell high we are just on the front end of all these foreclosures happening
3968213 25 things you should know to profit off short sales and foreclosures
3968214 wow this site looks awesome and i can navigate through it very easily
3968215 this site looks horrible but boy is this coding job awesome
3968216 i expect to have 85 000 in loans when i am done
3968217 i have a little over a year remaining in school and i am more scared of the loan payments than i am of finding a well paying job
3968218 even after serving my country and receiving the g i bill i still expect to have around 27 000 in loans
3968219 that is almost a car payment or half a mortgage payment and it is scary to think about
3968220 if only we had gotten that loan we would have survived
3968221 the us has for several years now mishandled the situation in georgia
3968222 the way that mikheil saakashvili has approached this has been by thinking that he could be an extension of the west a partner of the united states
3968223 in many ways we have given him cause for thinking that with the many visits to the united states the talk of georgia as a beacon for democracy
3968224 underlying all this is a larger more significant contest a geopolitical struggle between russia and the west over the export of caspian sea oil and natural gas
3968225 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
3968226 the kremlin made abundantly clear that it would view kosovos independence without serbian consent and a un security council mandate as a pthe us has had stern words for russia over its military intervention in georgia to back south ossietian separatists but many analysts say that the bush administration must share the blame for the crisis
3968227 in light of the fact that were now in iraq with all the problems in terms of perceptions about america that have been created us launching some missile strikes into iran is not the optimal position for us to be in
3968228 on the other hand having a radical muslim theocracy in possession of nuclear weapons is worse so i guess my instinct would be to err on not having those weapons in the possession of the ruling clerics of iran i hope it doesnt get to that point
3968229 russia averts humanitarian crisis in separatist georgian states of south ossetia and abkhazia
3968230 we will preserve our territorial integrity georgia will never be divided we will win
3968231 i will have no lobbyists working on my campaign except for the 130 working on my campaign
3968232 ok guys and girls we need to get to work this osama bastard is making everyone realize that im old and senile in comparison so lets come up with something clever that makes me look worldly and presidential which lobbyist has the most money to spend
3968233 like it or not its the way its gotta be you gotta love yourself if you can ever love me
3968234 would i turn my nose up at another round with shodan no
3968235 but john mccain is four more years of george w bush
3968236 and now my former student teacher also woodwind coordinator assistant high school band director 5th and 6th grade band director 7th and 8th grade general music teacher and high school jazz director tom wise
3968237 its a little late i should go thanks for uh listening im sorry i dont know your name

3968239 youre body says other wise kitten this aint no dream youre dead kid
3968240 right who knew slipping on a banana peel led to this bloody mess

3968274 when people understand the world of opportunity they can find through computers and the internet they are inspired to learn 21st century technology skills
3968275 many of the communities we visit are initially hesitant to embrace information technology but we remove this barrier by tailoring our programs to meet local economic health and educational needs and ensuring our approach aligns with the indigenous cultures in which we work
3968276 thanks to vasconcelos support and the increased access to technology in our community we are making education in our schools more effective and meaningful for our children
3968277 vasconcelos is transforming peoples lives by bringing information knowledge and hope to communities
3968278 its work is providing new opportunities for people young and old to improve the quality of their lives and ensure a better future for their families i hope vasconcelos example will encourage more organizations and governments to provide greater access to information and technology for those most in need
3968279 that anyone could come into the school after hours and take advantage of defenceless animals that have been lovingly cared for by our students is disappointing
3968280 there will be consequences for the students according to their level of involvement
3968281 the college has put procedures in place to manage the wellbeing of all students
3968282 it is run for years 9 12 and we would have 150 plus kids involved including vce level to prepare them for university it is not a mickey mouse subject

3968297 when i ceased to be a communist and therefore ditched an essentially undemocratic philosophy i adopted democracy as a new faith with the real fervour of the convert we centre left ex communists believe passionately in democracy because weve reasoned ourselves towards it so we are perhaps more prepared to support wars that establish or defend it

3968300 accepted more than 100 000 from an unnamed russian oligarch to establish a programme on russian democracy the money does not come directly it is channelled through london pr companies presided over by a retinue of former new labour special advisers the pr people want to shift public sympathy away from vladimir putin who is at odds with several oligarchs and they are no doubt delighted that the project has led to a paper criticising downing streets closeness to the russian president
3968301 islam has been from its inception a religion of the sword
3968302 the anti war movement is guilty of the worst kind of moral equivalence equating bush and blair with saddam and bin laden it has been seduced by anti americanism
3968303 the only political grouping now using the tactics developed by the global movements sporadic use of violence and oppositionism through uncontrollable and unpredictable networks is bin ladens al qaeda
3968304 it is a fairly radical policy and it comes close to some aspects of what has become known as neo conservative politics in the united states the proposal of a new kind of interventionism which has been called liberal interventionism or in some places neo imperialism
3968305 journalists must question every world view and that includes the liberal rationalist one they so often espouse
3968306 us confidence that it can win the war on terror effect a regime change in iraq and bring democracy to the islamic world stems in part from having done something like that before if communism could be toppled in the soviet bloc then many americans think the middle east can be just as radically reshaped now the ideas and assumptions behind anti communism are being revived to fight another ideology just as many believe communism was the biggest threat to western democracy in the last half of the 20th century so many see radical islam as the gravest threat today the concept of an existential struggle between good and evil has been revived in many cases by people who were near the front line of the anti communist battle of the cold war
3968307 the two main reporters on the case for the new york times michael gordon and judith miller had a reputation not easily won for hard work and accuracy if these two got it so wrong how do you get it right or were they reporting information and beliefs held in good faith which appeared to be right because the counter arguments appeared weaker or mendacious and how does journalism avoid that

3968323 identifying and attracting retailers in distressed city neighborhoods is difficult in periods of strong retail sales and becomes even extremely difficult during an economic downturn
3968324 this is an area thats had little retail activity in many years
3968325 there are two americas in terms of our education system and that cant continue
3968326 elevating public funding of education is our biggest problem and most important priority we must be able to attract more talented people to education
3968327 u s student achievement is lagging compared to other countries especially in the sciences and math
3968328 the problem is acute in the inner cities we cant continue to do what were doing there are two americas in terms of our education system and that cant continue
3968329 if i can help elevate teaching in importance if i can draw attention to the matter of public education maybe i can direct conversation as it is we spend a lot of money in this country on things that arent important we need to do better

3968346 the report also appears to support concerns raised by a growing number of university officials and corporate executives who say that the failure to produce students well prepared in science is undermining the countrys production of scientists and engineers and putting the nations economic future in jeopardy
3968347 science education in this country faces two serious problems the first is that too few americans perform at the highest level in science compared with our competitors abroad the second problem is that large numbers of aspiring science majors perhaps as many as half are turned off by unimaginative teaching and migrate to other disciplines before graduating
3968348 the students are encouraged to study in groups and taught to solve complex problems collectively as teams of scientists do most important they are quickly exposed to cutting edge science in laboratory settings which demystifies the profession and gives them early access to work that often leads to early publication in scientific journals
3968349 those who earn cs for example are encouraged to repeat those courses so they can master basic concepts before moving on
3968350 students who completed the meyerhoff program are 5 3 times as likely to enroll in graduate study as the students who said no and went elsewhere
3968351 in far reaching recommendations intended to improve science literacy a national panel says students should be exposed to science at earlier ages teachers should receive better training and curriculums should offer more real life applications the recommendations released on thursday acknowledge that science instruction generally fails to give students challenging inventive assignments and that students are often asked to memorize scientific theories and facts in a vacuum
3968352 the problem of uneven science teaching is particularly acute in the early grades for which teachers are trained as generalists educators said in many elementary schools educators said science instruction tends to be watered down and given a secondary status in the school day
3968353 the national science foundation today opened a 25 million campaign to improve science education in elementary and secondary schools in the agencys largest such effort since the 1960s
3968354 we are failing to provide an adequate background an adequate introduction and an adequate level of science literacy for the population as a whole as a result the preparation of a sufficient number of candidates for careers in science engineering and technology is inadequate
3968355 the foundation official said the project would at first focus on elementary school students because most of them received little science education if any he said a major reason for the project was that the nation needed a technically sophisticated work force to remain economically competitive

3968367 the applicant should not be extradited to the united states before midnight on 29 august
3968368 i feel in the middle of a budget year to pull the rug out from local governments hospitals and nursing homes among other things is just not fair
3968369 what is most troubling is a governor who is a democrat in the middle of the budget year advancing a series of cuts without considering a series of revenue raisers to help balance out these cuts
3968370 we cant take it on the back of local governments because it will go straight to the taxpayers
3968371 will we have to lay off people absolutely will we have to raise taxes absolutely 197 000 dollars is about 5 more in taxes in this community
3968372 this lopsided approach i dont think will resonate very well with the democrats in the assembly and we just may come in have a debate and discussion and in the final analysis kick this over to later this year when we consider the budget for 2009 2010
3968373 sir you will either die on the gallows or of some unspeakable disease
3968374 he has all the virtues i dislike and none of the vices i admire
3968375 i have never killed a man but i have read many obituaries with great pleasure
3968376 he has never been known to use a word that might send a reader to the dictionary
3968377 thank you for sending me a copy of your book ill waste no time reading it
3968378 i didnt attend the funeral but i sent a nice letter saying i approved of it
3968379 he has no enemies but is intensely disliked by his friends
3968380 i am enclosing two tickets to the first night of my new play bring a friend if you have one
3968381 cannot possibly attend first night will attend second if there is one
3968382 i feel so miserable without you its almost like having you here
3968383 he is a self made man and worships his creator
3968384 ive just learned about his illness lets hope its nothing trivial
3968385 he is not only dull himself he is the cause of dullness in others
3968386 he is simply a shiver looking for a spine to run up
3968387 in order to avoid being called a flirt she always yielded easily
3968388 he loves nature in spite of what it did to him
3968389 why do you sit there looking like an envelope without any address on it
3968390 his mother should have thrown him away and kept the stork
3968391 some cause happiness wherever they go others whenever they go
3968392 he uses statistics as a drunken man uses lamp posts for support rather than illumination
3968393 i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years
3968394 we saw and tested the movie and we believe a strong movie deserves a strong play date
3968395 have to take the next step in relation to contempt

3968418 toen ik omhoog keek naar het scorebord dacht ik alleen wow ik heb het geflikt
3968419 daarom zal ik in het begin van de rally gaan sturen maar daarna doen we dat fiftyfifty om beurten
3968420 ik begrijp niet dat navigators naast de bestuurder willen zitten de fun bestaat voor mij uit sturen het gas geven en het rempedaal maar ik kijk naar het avontuur uit tim kwam altijd met stoere verhalen over de dakar rally ik vertelde hem dat ik dat ook wel eens wilde meemaken
3968421 we hebben ook een jaar samen in de klas van de middelbare school gezeten halverwege het schooljaar werden we uit elkaar gehaald omdat we elkaar constant zaten op te fokken moest tim naar een andere klas
3968422 ik hoor al om me heen dat we het niet gaan halen daar zullen ze nog van gaan opkijken
3968423 ons voordeel is dat we beiden enorm gedreven zijn ja er is ook een nadeel en dat is ons temperament toch wilde ik met tom nog eens zoiets doen tom was meteen enthousiast
3968424 toen ik de eerste keer in de werkplaats kwam en zag wat er voor werk wordt verricht dacht ik jongens de rally is pas over een halfjaar wat een serieuze onderneming
3968425 dat hij negen jaar bij fc barcelona in de jeugd heeft gespeeld geeft al aan dat het een talentvolle jongen is want als je daar niet presteert word je meteen weggestuurd wij denken dat hij een jongen is die in de toekomst veel voor nac kan betekenen

3968428 the government and the railways will reply after checking the facts
3968429 suppose i give a gift to you is it wrong
3968430 so it is ridiculous to allege that the land was bought by money given by rabri devi
3968431 but suddenly he got enough money in 2004 to buy the land plots and gift them to his daughter in 2006

3968433 niet als algemeen directeur maar als zakelijk directeur in een collegiaal bestuur
3968434 in eerste instantie was ik teleurgesteld maar zag mijn nieuwe functie nooit als degradatie
3968435 maar nadat ik met de raad van commissarissen had gesproken wist ik dat men gelijk had een belangrijke voorwaarde om de job te accepteren was dat de statutaire directie een collegiaal bestuur zou blijven elk directielid is even verantwoordelijk
3968436 de groei van ajax valt op het zakelijke vlak te bewerkstelligen we zullen meer geld moeten binnenhalen om op een hoger niveau te kunnen spelen de rvc vindt dat op mijn lijf geschreven en wil mij vrijmaken voor datgene waar ik goed in ben de tijd van een algemeen directeur wordt ook opgeslokt door allerlei representatieve functies
3968437 de algemeen directeur heeft een voetbalachtergrond en danny blind woont alle directievergaderingen bij in de praktijk zullen er geen beslissing worden genomen waar marco en hij het niet mee eens zijn
3968438 doordat ajax beursgenoteerd is en er nog enkele details uitgewerkt moeten worden

3968444 if america goes to war government power will grow enormously probably with the blessing of the people history tells us that the state will never surrender all of its new authority

3968446 let the terrorists be warned if you overstay your visas by even one day we will arrest you if you violate a local law and we hope that you will well work to make sure you are put in jail and kept in custody as long as possible

3968453 at adelaide we have three strikers now for one position in the game we play
3968454 i try to give as much as i can and the coach aurelio vidmar will decide who will play
3968455 in the first half against melbourne it was our first game together and it wasnt very good
3968456 but in the second half we were much better we worked better
3968457 we played a 4 1 4 1 but i prefer to play with two strikers
3968458 i hope that all the players are fit for the game against perth and the coach must make good choices playing at home we have to win the games and then we have to play with two strikers for sure if we play at home ok we need a 4 4 2
3968459 many of these neighborhoods that made these great gains in the 1990s with the downturn in the beginning of this decade and the weak recovery have been hit hard by this economic change
3968460 weve lost a lot of ground and see poverty again increasing in these neighborhoods
3968461 as people try to work their way out of poverty they dont find as many of the opportunities they need in very low income neighborhoods
3968462 tanto am dios al mundo que entreg a su hijo nico para que todo el que crea en el no se pierda sino que tenga vida eterna
3968463 el que quiera ser el primero que sea el ultimo
3968464 yo soy la luz del mundo el que me sigue no caminar en tinieblas sino que tendr la luz de la vida
3968465 su madre y sus parientes quer an verlo pero no pod an acerc rsele por el gent o que hab a
3968466 tu madre y tus hermanos est n afuera y quieren verte
3968467 mi madre y mis hermanos son los que escuchan la palabra de dios y la ponen en pr ctica
3968468 a todos los que lo recibieron les concedi ser hijos de dios estos son los que creen en su nombre

3968479 however even if online video advertisers are following eyeballs they are far more tentative than the audience itself
3968480 figuring out the best types of video content to attach their ads to is one of the big questions is it short form video or longer pieces is it professionally created video or can user generated video ever become a safe harbor for large numbers of brand marketers
3968481 with well over 11 million copies of guitar hero rock band sold on the playstation consoles we see a tremendous opportunity in bringing starpex to market
3968482 never before have guitar hero rock band enthusiasts been able to shred with a hardwood handcrafted
3968483 he was in absolute fear of his life and trembling
3968484 ill teach you to show me the f ing red card you so and so
3968485 we were not surprised by the fine performance of the liege side we had seen enough of them to know they were a good aggressive side
3968486 the real surprise for me was the way liverpool played the only positive to take from the match was the fact that we did not concede a goal
3968487 we will have to be a lot better in the second leg at anfield much better
3968488 we have been playing well in pre season looking confident and passing the ball well
3968489 but we did not do any of those things i did not want to bring steven gerrard on because the doctors had told me he was not fit enough to start the match
3968490 we waited until well into the second half before using him but we were not controlling the game and i had to bring him on
3968491 this game was far more difficult than we expected and jose reina was the man of the match
3968492 we know we can always rely on pepe to stop penalties but we have been told that the other effort may have been behind the line but these things happen
3968493 liverpool maybe came here asleep and not expecting this sort of game
3968494 maybe though we have woken them up for the second leg which will me much harder for us
3968495 we felt that if we did not lose this first leg we would still be in with a chance we know though that we still have to score and that could be the problem
3968496 i think we played well in the first half and they almost couldnt create a chance their goal was our fault
3968497 however im worried about the injuries to leandro gracian and rodrigo palacio
3968498 we were a very young team and we did not lose our nerve did not panic
3968499 in the end maybe our technical superiority allowed us to score two goals that is a massive advantage for the second leg but we will be on our toes
3968500 they imposed a very physical game on us with man marking all over the pitch they did that with a lot of belief and spirit
3968501 they have given so much in the first half they could not keep the same pace and tightness in their marking
3968502 you saw a performance of great spirit and arsenal were rattled they know they have been in a game
3968503 it just showed our inexperience in europe in key moments and key occasions that we lost this game
3968504 we have a hell of a mountain to climb now but we just need to put in another good performance
3968505 but he believed in himself he was the kind of person who set a goal and then did it no matter what
3968506 somebody would say lets go waterskiing and even though hed never done it hed say alright cool
3968507 intellectually it was one of the most engaging times of my 20 year career
3968508 he wanted to be famous he wanted to win the nobel prize
3968509 he would see something cool and all of a sudden hed want to do that
3968510 one time he watched a show about marc jacobs and decided he wanted to be a designer one of his friends learned how to fly a plane and then he wanted to try it
3968511 this past year was probably the best year of our lives we had time together and it was really quality time we would drive in the convertible and hed have the top down the wind in his hair god he loved life
3968512 just because someone comes up and says something doesnt mean its true
3968513 the credibility of the female witnesses all of whom have faced multiple felony counts of drug and other offenses will play a crucial role in the trial we have a lot of evidence to present
3968514 most of these offenses are aggravating especially when they come from any public official who had imposed upon them the and trust
3968515 i just tried to black out the whole thing it was bad
3968516 the different physical interface with the tool leads to a corresponding different mental interface with ones surroundings walking around with a 35mm slr is simply physically different than walking around with a tripod and an 8 10
3968517 maybe the projects a person is drawn to are the ones that are also best suited to the camera he likes maybe the two decisions are nearly inseparable
3968518 the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century
3968519 to show to russia that we can come to the aid of a european ally and that we can do it at will whenever and wherever we want
3968520 we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
3968521 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3968522 we were unhappy with the initial actions of the american officials because they were perceived by the russians as green lines basically but this one was very strong
3968523 we wont be protecting the airport or seaport but well certainly protect our assets if we need to
3968524 to continue our efforts to rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
3968525 as to choosing the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
3968526 and we are aware that the u s is uptight about this project
3968527 but a choice will have to be made someday between considerations of prestige related to an illusory project and a real partnership in matters which indeed require collective efforts
3968528 lets be very clear whose interests are being served by the partnership that russia and the united states have engaged in on iran or north korea
3968529 there were georgian attacks overnight but our troops are in full control of the city so far weve had no orders to move south into georgia
3968530 there was a great wave of pressure which twisted me and flung me against the kitchen wall
3968531 this land is my body my home we are a proud beautiful people and we are not leaving i survived i am alive
3968532 we are raising a toast to those who are left
3968533 those tanks in the street we hit them with rocket propelled grenades from the basement
3968534 the georgians were 30 times stronger than us they wanted to kill us to destroy everything but we held them off
3968535 if you have inherited boxes of photos do something about them today
3968536 besides showing my grandparents my father as a boy several of my aunts an uncle by marriage and two first cousins the photograph when removed from the frame shows two family pets two feist dogs the photograph is thought to have been made at the family home at weavers creek near parham monroe county mississippi
3968537 ive had a great time but the circuit is getting harder and harder
3968538 there are more tournaments more travelling it gets very tiring and expensive to keep up if you are an amateur and really you have to be in the top 10 to earn enough from the sport or sponsorship to make it
3968539 we have great control techniques but at the end of the day theyre so tall youre not going to get past
3968540 you cant tell anything about a person from the music they like
3968541 hes the greatest olympian in the world and hell be able to earn money everywhere as hes an international brand
3968542 hes a billion dollar man he wont have to get a job ever he can live off this for 50 years
3968543 in the heat and intensity of this event it may seem that his earning power is limitless but you have to pull back and look at someone like tiger woods who has performed at a top level for years and years in front of the world
3968544 the olympics is only held once every four years after a year to so americans forget about the olympics and move to stars they see more kids want someone else on their weetabix box
3968545 you need to be out there early and establish your affiliation with the property michael phelps
3968546 his performance here will benefit us as it will add to the visibility we will get through this affiliation and his earning ability will increase theres no question of that
3968547 in the short term he is a gold mine because he represents everything that is pure young strong and visionary about america we havent had anyone of this significance since mark spitz
3968548 guaranteed there will be marketers wanting a piece of him that make no sense and it will interesting to see how his handlers cope with this and if they get greedy because the olympics has a narrow avenue of marketability
3968549 i think its open to interpretation and thats the great thing you know if i want to protest something because it offends me thats my right as an american and its also any artists right to say and do whatever they wanna do
3968550 the sheer influence and scope of a project like tropic thunder also bears consideration the popularity and quote ability of such a film guarantees that increased use of retard and the remarkably offensive tagline never go full retard will echo through school halls a couple of weeks
3968551 i dont want max to go to school and hear that because someday hell realize what it means and its scary its harmful because it prevents people from seeing individuals with disabilities as people with value to add to our community
3968552 as a dad its challenging enough when you have a child with a disability and youre constantly fighting for them to have a place in society and to be respected
3968553 parents need to talk to kids about offensive language whether it be racial language or language about disabilities
3968554 say the word retard out loud and pay attention to the image that immediately comes to your mind now think about what that image means to the men women and children who fight through every day working to overcome the barriers that society puts in front of them along with their own personal challenges
3968555 i heard people say it about me and i just ignore it i think its really inconsiderate
3968556 im a golfer basketball player and i play softball and volleyball speed skate and play bocce
3968557 we really want to focus on the ability of our athletes not the disabilities
3968558 we received lots of suggestions but one pattern emerged which was to keep the name simple
3968559 el camino was really popular but our intent was to honor chevrolet heritage and not use the name
3968560 its part of chevrolets history and we felt it was important we respect we wouldnt want chevrolet to use a name like gto
3968561 im not sure we want to call it the doris
3968562 i would have thought they would have picked a real name
3968563 i like heritage names like gmc sprint a good name beats an alphanumeric name but an alphanumeric beats a stupid name g8 st is pure vanilla it wont offend anyone
3968564 its a wonderfully eclectic objet dart speckled with an observable indifference for maureen dowd
3968565 i tried reading your blog but i couldnt fucking understand any of it
3968566 weve been on the epa to get us a list of these tanks
3968567 there has been no communication with our agency on any of this
3968568 if they went in during the cold war the chances that they are leaking are really really good
3968569 i have yet to wait on a line at this grocery and the girls at the register are always so quick and pleasant
3968570 i mean i think they make you sing songs and do a ritual or something
3968571 last night i discovered a new new york favorite in park blue
3968572 there have been so many doors in my life that only god could have opened to bring me to this place that i could never tell you about them all so many doors that i could have never opened on my own
3968573 theres no agreement yet but we are making some progress
3968574 you dont have to be a card carrying member of the social register to dine here but if you are not you will most likely be in the minority
3968575 your hair was already like that before you came on
3968576 but playing lara croft the sexiest game heroine there is should get me a few more dates
3968577 the most pusillanimous sissified utterly useless mark of punctuation ever invented
3968578 a stunning drop in semicolon usage between the 18th and 19th centuries from 68 1 semicolons per thousand words to just 17 7
3968579 root them strong roots will allow you more freedom of movement move your energy down to enable you to shift up
3968580 we expect these awards to play a significant role in changing the career trajectory of funded researchers encouraging talented young investigators to pursue careers in stem cell research
3968581 en este momento se est pensando abriendo la cabeza para ver que realmente no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
3968582 the lithuanian government under the cloak of pursuing investigations and apprehension of criminals is engaged in the elimination of friends of the soviet union
3968583 its a little bit of the old and its a little bit of the new
3968584 i think it will be something attractive for all ages
3968585 these horses do all kinds of things its quite a show because theyre very well trained
3968586 we do have to go to the market to raise the money and market conditions arent really robust right now
3968587 we did have a very narrow focus on how we wanted to raise the money so what were doing is going to expand that focus to include some other forms of financing
3968588 we just have to make sure on the landis side we meet the cash call
3968589 there are fish coming in trying to jump but they are falling back and cant make it up over the falls
3968590 this ladder will be in operation for salmon season this fall
3968591 the water has been consistently coming for the past couple of weeks so it is starting to attract fish
3968592 we didnt want to change the landscape so the only disturbance you will see is the ladder itself
3968593 because it didnt make the first round doesnt necessarily mean that it wont be done in the future
3968594 at the end of the day the three projects that were given the green light were at that particular time more highly prioritized
3968595 to be attractive to the marketplace however it may be necessary to bundle the residence project with other potential sip projects in the province
3968596 bundling would also have the added benefit of reducing procurement costs to nsac
3968597 this issue has come before council before and council refused the application for exemption under the bylaw
3968598 under the assessment act the curling club is a taxable property they are not exempt
3968599 its been a historic club of truro its provided a lot of entertainment to the community over the years
3968600 i think its well within our prerogative to encourage some stability in any way we can
3968601 i have longed to return to my true love which is making movies so thats what ive decided to do
3968602 my salon discriminates against no one we are the experts in straight hair asian hair black hairstyles as well as styles for latina hair no texture left out of coarse after all were hair play
3968603 what is amazing this year is how many people have bought the fundamentally childish notion that if you dont like the way things are going the answer is to write a blank check for generic change empowering someone chosen not on the basis of any track record but on the basis of his skill with words

3968620 a vit ria foi boa mas precisamos descansar pois teremos um importante jogo pelo brasileiro no fim de semana vamos com moral

3968644 a poster child of the extremist elitist gun control movement
3968645 to somehow suggest obama is supportive of gun owners because he says so when he is in montana running for president is absurd
3968646 we are going to make sure that anybody that tells montana gun owners that barack obama is not a threat to gun owners is exposed as someone who is not shooting straight
3968647 the nra is wrong to suggest we are misleading anybody
3968648 hes the greatest olympian in the world and hell be able to earn money everywhere as hes an international brand
3968649 hes a billion dollar man he wont have to get a job ever he can live off this for 50 years
3968650 in the heat and intensity of this event it may seem that his earning power is limitless but you have to pull back and look at someone like tiger woods who has performed at a top level for years and years in front of the world
3968651 the olympics is only held once every four years after a year to so americans forget about the olympics and move to stars they see more kids want someone else on their weetabix box
3968652 you have to make the most of every at bat and every opportunity
3968653 im a guy who in the past has played a lot but i accept this role and dont put any added pressure on myself you just have to go out there with confidence
3968654 thats a dangerous lineup over there and they can really make you pay
3968655 you have to stay focused and minimize the bad pitches and i was able to do that
3968656 i want to be the guy up in that situation every time i just havent been getting too many hits in that situation lately
3968657 he gave up a lot of hits but he never gave up the big inning
3968658 gonzalez gets that off the wall and were in trouble if he doesnt make that catch the whole inning changes and were looking at the possibility of a big inning
3968659 fostering the creation of a condition and aligning it with a product
3968660 it is very much in the interest of the pharmaceutical industry to draw a line that includes as large a population as possible within the ill category the bigger this group is the more drugs they can sell
3968661 but now the long ball heaving favre is out and the inexperienced aaron rodgers is in while jennings will remain the deep ball threat rodgers probably wont be given the green light to launch downfield as often as favre did that means driver will run a lot of simpler slants and outs get a lot of passes thrown his way and theoretically see more looks in the red zone sure driver may not have any 60 yard scores but hes a top target in what should be an efficient offense
3968662 i thought he had power on his two seamer and his cutter we set out to get a win and we did that we made it a little more interesting than we needed to but i thought his stuff was really good we scored early and we added on
3968663 like i always say you play nine innings and we did tonight
3968664 mendoza just didnt have it i was hoping that he could keep us in the ballgame but when you spot those guys those kind of runs last night we were able to make it up but tonight you cant keep expecting to try to make that up it was just one of those nights again
3968665 she started serving really well at the end of the match and i didnt get a chance to finish
3968666 as soon as the tiebreaker started i knew i had to be aggressive and keep the pressure up
3968667 i knew it was going to be a tough match
3968668 i made a lot of mistakes in the first set
3968669 when the second set began i decided i had to change up i started hitting a lot of heavy balls and lobs and i saw she didnt know what to do with those sometimes you have to win ugly
3968670 after i broke her to go up 2 1 and 4 1 she seemed to lose her confidence
3968671 i knew i still had to be at the top of my game and not give her any easy games what i liked about today was i was able to keep the pressure on to ensure my level of play and not give her any easy points
3968672 once i got my serve going and my feet moving i was able to move the ball around on her and make her play
3968673 no one really did anything wrong i just wish i could have gotten that pitch to vernon down a little more
3968674 this is dangerous because were doing just enough to lose right now
3968675 thats not good we have to start doing the things that it takes to win
3968676 i didnt throw enough strikes early but i started to relax about the fourth inning thats when i started making the pitches i wanted
3968677 you get a walk an aggravating bunt and then a double play grounder that takes a bad hop
3968678 kenny did very well tonight but weve been getting bad hops lately
3968679 he just has to work on getting first pitch strikes and getting ahead of hitters
3968680 i didnt want to go out there and see a bone sticking out of his leg
3968681 hell be reassessed in a couple days but if he cant pitch it will be a big loss for the team
3968682 i dont pay attention to it ive been on waivers plenty of times
3968683 lots of great players are put on waivers but it is only a story when it is someone like manny ramirez or me someone that people have an opinion about
3968684 many youths carrying various types of dangerous weapons have started grouping themselves for further action over the issue before the police and hisbah men dispersed them

3968832 and samuel said hath the lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou hast rejected the word of the lord he hath also rejected thee from being king

3968849 for he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee
3968850 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose

3968862 but to remember the time where you first knew the joy of the lord sometimes the joy of the lords salvation is stolen because youve become a depleted vessel and many times you get depleted because you dont wait upon the lord david said in
3968863 i waited patiently for the lord and he inclined unto me and heard my cry

3968871 obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you

3968877 we cant keep the christians from going to church we cant keep them from reading their bibles and knowing the truth we cant even keep them from conservative values we can keep them from forming an intimate abiding relationship with christ if they gain that connection with jesus our power over them is broken so let them go to church let them have their conservative lifestyles but steal their time so they cant gain that intimacy with jesus christ
3968878 this is what i tell you to do angels distract them from gaining hold of their saviour and maintaining that vital connection throughout their day
3968879 keep them busy in the non essentials of life and invent unnumbered schemes to occupy their minds
3968880 tempt them to spend spend spend then borrow borrow borrow convince the wives to go to work for long hours and the husbands to work 6 or 7 days a week 10 to 12 hours a day so they can afford their lifestyles keep them from spending time with their children as their family fragments soon their homes will offer no escape from the pressures of work
3968881 over stimulate their minds so that they cannot hear that still small voice entice them to play the radio or cassette player whenever they drive to keep the tv vcr cds and their pcs going constantly in their homes and see to it that every store and restaurant in the world plays non biblical contradicting music constantly this will jam their minds and break that union with christ
3968882 fill their coffee tables with magazines and newspapers pound their minds with the news 24 hours a day invade their driving moments with billboards flood their mailboxes with junk mail sweepstakes mail order catalogs and every kind of newsletter and promotional offering free products services and false hopes
3968883 even in their recreation let them be excessive have them return from their recreation exhausted disquieted and unprepared for the coming week dont let them go out in nature to reflect on gods wonders send them to amusement parks sporting events concerts and movies instead
3968884 and when they meet for spiritual fellowship involve them in gossip and small talk so that they leave with troubled consciences and unsettled emotion let them be involved in soul winning but crowd their lives with so many good causes that they have no time to seek power from christ soon they will be working in their own strength sacrificing their health and family for the good of the cause

3968899 the state supreme court ruled recently that school districts in washington do not have to disclose names of teachers who have been accused of sexual misconduct against students if the allegations have not been substantiated yes public knowledge of the allegation could lead to the end of a teachers career even if it were proven to be false but were not talking about a witch hunt a few teachers being unjustly accused is far less important in the long run than the outing of a school district that hides evidence of patterns of misbehavior by teachers
3968900 victims will decide whether a crime has occurred and defendants will not this might frighten men some of whom will claim that women will use the law to punish men out of vengeance that might happen once in awhile

3968913 why all the fuss modern governments generate a vast number of digital files from birth certificates and tax returns to criminal dna records the documents must be retrievable in perpetuity so governments are reluctant to store official records in the proprietary formats of commercial software vendors this concern will only increase as e government services such as filing a tax return or applying for a driving licence online gain momentum in microsofts case security flaws in its software such as those exploited by the recent blaster and sobig viruses are also a cause of increasing concern
3968914 it would be more of a layout and production thing
3968915 in my mind the feature section plays a big role
3968916 we have been flexible in adding niche products and are very creative in how we use staff and freelancers to get it done
3968917 we are looking at some different types of things such as a shared production approach to put together certain feature sections producing features out of one place to have certain types of sections put together in one layout design

3968925 anything promoted by pro life groups the pro choice democrats just wouldnt be for it
3968926 they just didnt want to give the pro life groups a victory
3968927 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
3968928 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3968929 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
3968930 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
3968931 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early
3968932 instructions are being developed and being sent to boards of election across the state to make sure voting is consistent
3968933 there is no question that the huge effort to register and turn out voters at ohio state university is going to have a positive impact on our race
3968934 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
3968935 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
3968936 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
3968937 it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does after the election in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee

3968980 this years presidential election has generated a record number of voter registrations from minority groups some speculators have suggested however that with obama being the first black presidential nominee mccain could stand to lose a number of minority votes by utilizing promotional products companies and organizations supporting either mccain or obama can keep their chosen candidates message and likelihood fresh in the minds of their employees customers or members
3968981 its unfortunate that minority voters have a reputation for not turning out at the polls its so important this year more than ever for everyone including minorities to get out and vote corvests promotional products are an excellent way to reinforce a candidates message and for encouraging people to vote
3968982 thankfully our customers on the west coast survived this earthquake with only a few broken dishes in florida were always worried when the next catastrophic hurricane will hit so we have complete understanding for what californians go through with the uncertainty of when the big quake will come yesterdays earthquake caused very minimal damage yet some businesses and residents experienced power outages corvest is encouraging companies to be proactive about providing their customers and employees with branded safety lights just in case the big one comes sooner rather than later
3968983 every geographical region has to incur natural disasters of some kind the midwest has tornadoes new england has snow storms and the south has hurricanes the impact of hurricane dolly partnered with yesterdays earthquake serves as proof that all regions can benefit from the use of promotional safety tools
3968984 secondary schools stand to earn high profits from the sale of promotional items plush school mascots for instance hold a high sentimental value and therefore are always great sellers school supplies such as personalized pens and pencils and embroidered backpacks also sell in large numbers thanks to their practicality
3968985 weve had several customers who have been able to attend out of state sports camps and national level competitions thanks to the sale of corvests promotional products its always nice to hear the positive things that come about because of our products
3968986 dennis will make an excellent addition to our leadership team because of his background and extensive experience in retail channels and specialty markets we expect great things from dennis and are looking forward to seeing the results his expertise will bring to market identity
3968987 corvest fully respects the traditional distributor selling channels in the promotional products industry our promotional products subsidiaries are separate entities from market identity as a result dennis will be selling to a separate group of customers who like promotional products distributors are resellers unlike our promotional products distributor customers however market identitys customers are resellers in the retail channel
3968988 all year employees look forward to taking their families on summer vacations unfortunately because of the cost of gas the rising cost of airfare and the weakening us dollar many americans are forced to either visit local attractions or take no vacation at all its been proven that taking time off from work actually increases productivity organizations looking to appease their employees and increase efficiency should utilize corvests promotional products to encourage their staff to take a break and relax
3968989 these items will not only serve to encourage employees to participate in recreational activities and to relax but theyll serve as an advertising medium for the companies who order them theyll be able to spread their companys message or increase brand recognition at picnics parks beaches and other local attractions the small investment required for promotional products will really pay off in the end

3968991 i had a sense of what this meant to him
3968992 he has worked hard to establish an identity as an oriole but he did tell me it felt good

3969008 hurricane dolly and its impact on the state of texas has served to remind us all about the need for emergency preparedness as many texans begin to return home in the coming days it is our greatest hope that theyre greeted by a sturdy home with little to no damage as storms have a tendency to do however some residents will most likely be without electricity this is the perfect opportunity for companies in all industries to be proactive about providing their valued customers and employees with branded safety lights
3969009 the 2008 election season provides a wealth of sales opportunities for corvests valued promotional products distributors in fact prior to launching our political campaign sale corvest was receiving orders for embroidered obama tote bags and screen printed mccain umbrellas these orders sparked our idea to launch a sale surrounding the election
3969010 now more than ever thanks to the decline of the us dollar and the unfolding of indymac financial institutions have the responsibility to encourage their customers to spend and save wisely with so many consumers in fear over the current state of the economy its imperative for banks to calm those fears and to encourage a positive course of action
3969011 its important for organizations especially financial institutions to continue to advertise their products and services even in light of the current state of our economy expending advertising dollars is not only going to stimulate the economy but in a time when consumers are being more conservative with their disposable income it will make the difference in beating out the competition corvest promotional products are especially effective right now thanks to their low cost and high perceived value
3969012 our new facility has several state of the art features including a bar coded inventory management system as well as greater capacity for additional machines more team members and greater inventory levels
3969013 safety practices and the products that make these practices possible are integral to a number of industries because safety products are used in so many occupations and by such a large number of hobbyists and outdoorsmen there exists huge promotional potential for safety themed products it was a natural choice for corvest to focus on safety themed promotions and for us to release these sales tools to coincide with national safety month in june
3969014 ive become numb to the fact that such a great evil and i could become so intimate to use sex as a weapon of choice to try and kill people is so inhumane so out of this world there is no punishment fit for his crimes
3969015 this man is a danger to the public and to women he deserves condemnation from this court
3969016 theres no remorse here he doesnt care that these women may have contracted hiv he preyed on these women because they loved him and he took advantage of it its unspeakable betrayal to these women
3969017 why would someone want to make a child ready to die
3969018 i now realize i have done nothing wrong other than loving and trusting this man
3969019 this is an accused who went to great lengths to cover up the fact he was hiv positive
3969020 he even had access to free condoms for godsakes but the man never bothered he did what he wanted to do for his own gratification it was selfish abhorrent behaviour he had a callous disregard for the health of his victims
3969021 there was a lot of clean up to get it to sound fluid in transitions the original mono tracks were rough with rough transitions there was a lot of de humming and de clicking as well as time alignment issues to deal with
3969022 essentially paramount wanted it to sound like it had been released yesterday and we came close to achieving that
3969023 forgive me father its been a while since my last confession and alot has happened in that time
3969024 as you know by now the tour we had planned for march ahd to be cancelled and those who know us know the reasons why but we will not go in to them here for a band who has never cancelled a gig let alone a tour it was a big decision but one that had to be made
3969025 the next few months should see us make up for that in some small way with a few festival dates followed by gigs in october in italy and belgium the festival dates will see us play for the first time in lithuania and romania and we are really looking forward to it july sees us play day of darkness in ireland for a record breaking fourth time and it will be the first airing of the new songs and if rehearsals are anything to go by it should be an intense experience
3969026 the album was finally released after months of agonising wait with delays in the artwork to label delays but it is finally out and that is all that matters reviews for the album have been overwhelming and far beyond our expectations and hopefully this will open the door for a few more festival appearences next year
3969027 also coming soon is the lp version of dust to be released through sentinel records it is the original artwork nothing added nothing taken away we also have a split 10

3969031 we will now need to review the full range of our relations
3969032 has been very clear for a long time ive been very concerned about russian behavior in a broad variety of areas
3969033 address the future of the alliances relationship with russia and with our g7 partners we should discuss whether it makes sense for russia to continue its participation in the g8
3969034 we also need to review russias aspiration for membership in the world trade organization
3969035 i dont think were going to re ignite the cold war here with russia i dont see this is a return to nuclear standoffs
3969036 as the russians move into georgia as aggressors and if you read the statements from the beginning from sen mccain and sen obama one had a kind of moral neutrality to it that comes i think from inexperience
3969037 this study should be enlightening and practice changing for doctors and patients alike
3969038 shes going to come out here for the kids birthdays
3969039 im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3969040 its really going to be replacing cab rides and car trips for a lot of folks looking to get around the city quickly

3969044 it seemed like there was an unmet need in two situations
3969045 recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs and we had children dying whose family wanted to donate and we werent able to do it
3969046 in my opinion its an open and shut case they dont have irreversibility and they dont have death
3969047 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3969048 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3969049 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3969050 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3969051 but this issue is going to come up again the psc is going to have to face up to the fact that that reactor design is not final
3969052 im really not a chicken little player but i worry that no one seems to be focusing in on this
3969053 the level of excess capacity has shrunk down in the last few years to a level barely within the planning toleration of the industry
3969054 were to the point where we need every possible resource renewables demand response and energy efficiency nuclear clean coal you name it we need it
3969055 and we especially need the transmission lines that will bring the power generated by these new resources to consumers
3969056 if you dont have generation and transmission something has to give
3969057 the event was a major crisis and did probably force something to happen that would have otherwise not happened
3969058 its easy to take the power infrastructure for granted until something goes wrong
3969059 i am fighting for my heritage and my rights as a southerner and an american
3969060 its too bad there arent more people its a nice atmosphere
3969061 we are pleased with our restaurants here and our brands positioning amidst the wide expanse of the games and its spectators
3969062 obviously it would have been nice to see more numbers earlier
3969063 but we are seeing a growing trend which will continue once the track and field competition begins in the 91 000 seat birds nest later this week
3969064 we are aware of this issue we are already planning to invite more people to the olympic green we definitely want more people and spectators
3969065 here in beijing there have been a few who have requested that more people be admitted into what are known as the olympic common areas and the organizing committee has been working to find appropriate means of doing this which we welcome
3969066 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the back to school shopping season under way that does not bode well for retailers
3969067 there are moments when we wonder whether all this was worthwhile or not
3969068 i can tell you that what we are doing at the moment is sending a signal that the u n is back the u n is back to stay
3969069 we have to be able to move a lot of the investment to the private sector
3969070 our biggest way of improving security is to make sure that young people are employed

3969091 we didnt make any big deal out of it we moved on

3969099 i was absolutely astounded i just could not believe that it had happened in arkansas
3969100 ive heard nothing but good things about him prior to his death he was doing a good job and he was very good for the democratic party so its gonna be a big loss
3969101 its something we have never addressed before because we had no reason prior to today to be concerned about an invasion of one of our headquarters
3969102 i dont know what theyre going to do but im sure theyll do what is necessary to make sure that our headquarters is protected
3969103 dont tell me that you are afraid of a simple voting machine
3969104 its like someone mixed up all the medication at the asylumn
3969105 i dont give a rip for the american people they deserve what theyve voted for and i hope we get everything pelosi and murtha want its the military who lost big tonight the one group who deserved a victory who deserved our support who deserved our votes they the military lost tonight and my heart is laying in jagged pieces on the ground for them and them alone the rest of this country can go to hell
3969106 its the military who lost big tonight the one group who deserved a victory who deserved our support who deserved our votes
3969107 its the military who lost big tonight the one group who deserved a victory who deserved our support who deserved our votes they the military lost tonight and my heart is laying in jagged pieces on the ground for them and them alone
3969108 the one thing i have long noticed about these types of sites is that the more rabidly anti gay a person is the more explicit about gay sex they become
3969109 if youre forced to rely on random blog commenters to make a point about the prevalence of some form or another of disagreeable behavior youve pretty much made exactly the opposite point
3969110 if youre forced to rely on random blog commenters to make a point about the prevalence of some form or another of disagreeable behavior youve pretty much made exactly the opposite point unless youre using the quotes to criticize the left in which case no problem
3969111 so if it wasnt for all the lying corruption failed military adventures and general gross incompetence they wouldve kicked our asses
3969112 so if it wasnt for all the lying corruption failed military adventures and general gross incompetence
3969113 what would society be like with a lot of 30 year old virgins running around
3969114 this is totally untrue there is no case of respiratory illness in any children right now in the hospital no cases at all
3969115 who relies enormously on rumours as its early warning system
3969116 long before a government tells the world health organization that something has happened the rumour mill tell the world health organization that something might have happened
3969117 laypeople although i am sure he hopes to someday he is merely posting data
3969118 a spoken or written statement that gives an unjustly unfavorable impression of a person or thing
3969119 the latest data appears to be moving the pandemic to phase 6
3969120 since the 2005 flu pandemic is entering the final phase 6 a review of the h5n1 pandemic timeline is useful h5n1 progressed in asia from a bird flu in 1996 to a human pandemic in 2005
3969121 these data suggest the transmission of h5n1 in northern vietnam and thailand raises the pandemic phase to 5 or 6 yet who maintains that there is limited human to human transmission and classifies the pandemic as phase 3 this designation is clearly deliberately misleading moreover thailand is cited as model for control of h5n1 in humans because of no confirmed cases in 2005 yet appears to be a model for supression of reporting of human cases in and by the media
3969122 we may be at almost the last stage before the pandemic virus may emerge
3969123 whether the avian influenza pandemic will occur that is not the question any more but as to when the pandemic will occur
3969124 the pandemic stage 6 may be marked by two or more waves
3969125 i dont blame anyone for the postings i am actually glad they did
3969126 full independent research access to global h5 sequences it is not a panacea and i doubt in the last analysis if it will be shown to have had much effect on the course of events but it is still the right thing to do
3969127 highly likely h5n1 on south korean farms november 23 2006
3969128 roche has been in discussions with governments as early as 1997 regarding pandemic preparedness
3969129 it was bit harder than last night after the relay i was physically and emotionally drained so to get in and do another 53 point this morning was great
3969130 i have got a night off now so i can get focused and ready for tomorrow morning
3969131 i didnt really think about what time i needed but to go quicker than yesterday is good and its only a fraction off my best time so hopefully i can get up again tomorrow morning and go a bit quicker
3969132 are picking big business brands standing high in public regard
3969133 with the economy weakening and in the teeth of a recession john will keep taxes low create incentives to grow jobs and help small businesses
3969134 actually is more of the same failed bush policies of cutting taxes for high income people and big corporations
3969135 obamas economic plan is geared toward getting the economy going again and easing the struggle of ordinary americans
3969136 both mccain and obama are listening to us probably because we have plants in key states like michigan and ohio
3969137 frequently i have to debunk the misconceptions some people have
3969138 on my own time im taking care of women who have a need and im going to continue to deliver babies
3969139 you are allowed to practice medicine if you provide such services for free
3969140 tom coburn is like an imam at a pig roast he sees pork everywhere and he doesnt like it
3969141 the work of the ethics committee is confidential and we cannot comment on matters that may be before it
3969142 no one has ever chosen to have dr coburn deliver her baby in order to sway his vote
3969143 you were not to do anything with ice or immigration and illegals whether or not they committed a crime even to arrest them because there will be the perception we are harassing illegals
3969144 stop it this makes me sick this circular firing squad that is occurring is unattractive unprofessional unconscionable and unacceptable
3969145 i appreciate all you guys taking the time to be here
3969146 and begin discussions on the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia
3969147 this is the only consumer product that when used as intended kills people
3969148 takes the decisions about what might be in cigarettes away from the tobacco industry and turns them over to the scientists
3969149 fda regulates drugs and devices by approving products after weighing the benefits against the risks of a product
3969150 in contrast there is no such thing as a cigarette in which the benefits outweigh the risks the use of tobacco products is inherently unsafe
3969151 a war like no other how the athenians and spartans fought the peloponnesian war
3969152 it sure is nice to be back here in hawaii sitting on the beach with michelle and the girls just staring out at the ocean and up at the sky
3969153 hillary and bill and bill and hillary give em a place at the convention let em have a roll call vote let her speak let him speak pay off her debt why its
3969154 the gallup poll has me and mccain about tied tied i should be killing him but look at the recent numbers me up by a little and then he comes up and then its me again on a graph it looks like the brain scan of a dead man ive got to do something that clouds coming right at me
3969155 if theres a single demographic i should have but dont its white women
3969156 evan bayh whos kidding who what did evan bayh ever do the mans a cliche machine tim kaine we need virginia but kaines got no foreign policy experience at all whos left bill richardson good man but he couldnt win a single primary wow just look at that cloud
3969157 my people would scream bloody murder if i picked hillary
3969158 id better gather my stuff and get out of here
3969159 the united states europe and all other concerned countries must stand united in condemning this aggression and seeking a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3969160 we should continue to push for a united nations security council resolution calling for an immediate end to the violence this is a clear violation of the sovereignty and internationally recognized borders of georgia the u n must stand up for the sovereignty of its members and peace in the world
3969161 u n mediators cant even protect the dissident monks of burma or the opposition in zimbabwe let alone a small country trying to fight off single handed an invasion by the russian army
3969162 immediately and unconditionally cease military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory the consequences of euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3969163 us should immediately work with the e u and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
3969164 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
3969165 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world
3969166 in every club that i played i know my qualities
3969167 at adelaide we have three strikers now for one position in the game we play
3969168 i try to give as much as i can and the coach aurelio vidmar will decide who will play
3969169 in the first half against melbourne it was our first game together and it wasnt very good
3969170 but in the second half we were much better we worked better
3969171 we played a 4 1 4 1 but i prefer to play with two strikers
3969172 i hope that all the players are fit for the game against perth and the coach must make good choices
3969173 la mayor a de las personas son como alfileres sus cabezas no son lo m s importante
3969174 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
3969175 between one candidate who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
3969176 it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does after the election in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee
3969177 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
3969178 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3969179 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
3969180 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
3969181 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on and make sure their vote is cast early
3969182 instructions are being developed and being sent to boards of election across the state to make sure voting is consistent
3969183 there is no question that the huge effort to register and turn out voters at ohio state university is going to have a positive impact on our race
3969184 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
3969185 the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
3969186 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
3969187 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt

3969190 without any vote on whether or not the bond amount should be increased
3969191 the internal revenue service is also reviewing the tax exempt status of interest earned on a particular type of refunding bonds if the irs rescinds the tax exempt status of such bonds their market value would be reduced considerably
3969192 in our democracy we need to inform voters as much as possible
3969193 la coca na que consume pablo montero se la da el novio de nora salinas compa era de pablo en la telenovela en la que ambos participan
3969194 it is unlikely that aggression against our nato allies will occur with aircraft and tanks and troops a nation could achieve the same and worse effects simply by turning off the taps people freeze industry stops
3969195 given the characteristics of russian diplomacy which have been not only competitive but sometimes gripping people by the throat they are likely to feel irritated that someone else is in the field
3969196 traffic why we drive the way we do and what it says about us
3969197 a notorious speeder who racked up more than a dozen tickets in the span of four years
3969198 accident is a good word for describing such events as an otherwise vigilant driver being unable to avoid a tree that suddenly fell across the road
3969199 hilary provided a bracing corrective reminding people that the two men had served on a charitable board together the woods fund of chicago
3969200 all of these people will outnumber the voters that actually comprehend the obama is an empty suit
3969201 is he telling the truth about his thoughts and conclusions or is he merely saying what we want to hear
3969202 no one has been able to find any statements by obama regarding south ossetia or abkhazia prior to this past week
3969203 13 ers 88 of the 20 13 plus leaners 17
3969204 my concern is that he wont be constrained by congress so some of these more extreme policies might become law
3969205 there has been an incident at the party and chairman bill gwatney has been taken to the hospital
3969206 were just working to let the evidence go wherever it goes
3969207 vote november 4 as if your life and your future depend on it
3969208 through agents such as hiss the brandeis frankfurter apparatus branched out into all departments of the roosevelt administration
3969209 obama disagree with the idea that the american military is the principal threat to world peace
3969210 idea is that i do not believe obama thinks we are the biggest problem in the world
3969211 i just dont find the ayers connection and the implications that keep getting loaded into it very interesting i think weve seen enough of obama to know he is no mad bomber
3969212 on election day you can find white trash at your local tavern
3969213 lets not even get into the treason mccain committed while in vietnam no lets give over a night at the convention to that theme make a 20 state media buy around it bang that drum freddy
3969214 i had no idea there were so many retards in this country
3969215 yet in mccains own words just four days after being captured he admits he violated the u
3969216 o k ill give you military information if you will take me to the hospital
3969217 he received the nations third highest award the silver star for treason he provided aid and comfort to the enemy
3969218 this is serious freddy any meme about mccain and his wartime service will not reflect well on obama
3969219 well he said the phrase swiftboat lies which of course he cant name a single lie as neither can kerry or he would have taken up t boone pickens on his offer
3969220 flying too low over the iberian peninsula he took out some power lines which led to a spate of newspaper stories in which he was predictably identified as the son of an admiral
3969221 keating was what 30 years ago rezko is going to be sentenced at the end of the dem convention uncle tony had obama in his pocket for longer than mccain even knew keating and mccain never actually did a damn thing for keating while obama was instrumental in carrying legislation that was crucial to rezkos corruption of hospital boards one of the hospitals involved had paid obamas wife over 150k per year to do absolutely nothing of merit
3969222 though he was not convicted of anything mccain intervened on behalf of charles keating after keating gave mccain at least 112 00 in contributions
3969223 an obama presidency would almost certainly mean enactment of the
3969224 and to say he didnt do anything for mccain and this right before the s and l scandal is laughable
3969225 board shall be appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the senate
3969226 taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall
3969227 you crowd are the same brainiacs that voted for bush twice nice work basically youve been wrong about everything for 8 years
3969228 and they will analogize obamas outbursts with such incidences as the clearing of the temple by jesus christ as recorded in the gospels
3969229 whats worse a friendship with bill ayers or having helped charles keating try to get out of a federal investigation
3969230 mccain did commit treason he did help the enemy that you let it slide because he was tortured kinda messes with republican policy of torturing muslims as a source of accurate information
3969231 actions were not improper nor attended with gross negligence and did not reach the level of requiring institutional action against him senator mccain has violated no law of the united states or specific rule of the united states senate
3969232 the appearance of it was wrong its a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting with a group of regulators because it conveys the impression of undue and improper influence and it was the wrong thing to do
3969233 some critics of mr kerry quoted in the book had earlier praised his bravery in incidents they were now asserting he had fabricated one had earned a medal for bravery in a gun battle he accused mr kerry of concocting
3969234 the idea that we should talk about ayers wartime behavior but leave out huge chunks of mccains
3969235 we play with them here over there they are out for blood that is the difference
3969236 some critics of mr kerry quoted in the book had earlier praised his bravery in incidents they were now asserting he had fabricated one had earned a medal for bravery in a gun battle he accused mr kerry of concocting
3969237 im still thinking the republican 527s are going to use ayers and dohrn to wipe obama out in october when normal voters start paying attention
3969238 at minimum its an indicator of how easy it is for 60s radicals to be rehabilitated into the
3969239 why should i not run to embrace the truth when i see it coming
3969240 i notice that you guys share a bed but not an office
3969241 the ap caption reads this registration document made available on jan
3969242 the increased levels may bring the river level closer to residents land in the lower areas of ann st and awatere ave but is not expected to reach property
3969243 we are continuing to talk with residents and keep them informed of the situation
3969244 we still have cost escalation issues we have to deal with and the early retirement incentive is the right tool for maintaining cost efficiency
3969245 we still have cost escalation issues we have to deal with and the early retirement incentive is the right tool for maintaining cost efficiency
3969246 im definitely looking forward to the opportunity of making the clifton basketball team into a program
3969247 i took over a paterson catholic program that was already successful and eastside was a solid team as well i want to make clifton into a basketball program
3969248 but he has proven himself as a coach at other schools this will definitely be a boost to the program
3969249 the administration at eastside was great but it had to do with me being a kennedy guy
3969250 i wouldnt have minded staying at eastside coach davis told me he wasnt stepping down it was difficult for me to go back to being an assistant coach all over again and when i found out the clifton job was open i saw the opportunity
3969251 i am looking forward to taking part in the programs of the boys and girls clubs here and the rec program
3969252 i want to run basketball camps in the summer i know a lot of kids here go to places like queen of peace or st marys i want to be visible or run camps and show them that i am the head coach at clifton
3969253 hes a hard worker and he does the right things for his kids
3969254 i think im probably trading some athleticism for hustle and a better understanding of their own abilities
3969255 these kids can shoot they can dribble and they can play defense
3969256 im definitely looking forward to the opportunity of making the clifton basketball team into a program
3969257 i took over a paterson catholic program that was already successful and eastside was a solid team as well i want to make clifton into a basketball program

3969265 these kids can shoot they can dribble and they can play defense
3969266 its just one day until billy wagner gets back that hes talking about right
3969267 i just think that being healthy is important for him
3969268 i dont think the young pitchers who try to pitch through things have enough experience to adapt to a little pain here a little pain there i think that really affected him
3969269 i think that left arm thing was a little freakish
3969270 im not really that concerned with him in the years to come hell be able to make the adjustments to remain healthy not do as much between starts as he normally does to get himself going
3969271 its just one day until billy wagner gets back that hes talking about right
3969272 i just think that being healthy is important for him

3969275 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3969276 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3969277 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3969278 we cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late mr battellino said
3969279 even though the rate cut is priced in theres speculation on whether its 25 or 50 basis points he said
3969280 the comments by the reserve bank just reinforced the widely held opinion of the rate cut
3969281 the cloud of future rate cuts is plaguing the aussie dollar
3969282 if theres any sort of positive rebound for the aussie it most likely would be an upward movement in gold and oil mr waterer said adding the australian dollar could climb back to us0 8730 if commodity prices rose
3969283 returning from munich 70 years ago in 1938 british prime minister neville chamberlain said about czechoslovakia which had just been dismembered its a small far away place about which we know nothing
3969284 those countries who value freedom and democracy must stand up for it whenever it is threatened
3969285 we cant allow a second munich when the international community climbed down to hitler
3969286 if military aggression is being justified by the need to protect russian citizens then this should cause concern for all countries with russian nationals living within their borders
3969287 no state has the right to intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state or who are nationals of the state
3969288 acho que esse o caminho natural afinal de contas temos que buscar um padr o internacional em todo o mundo se fala etanol
3969289 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3969290 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3969291 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3969292 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3969293 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3969294 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3969295 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3969296 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3969297 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3969298 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3969299 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3969300 sumbungin kita sa mommy ko di ko alam kung ano ang sagot dito
3969301 i think these numbers should provide a bit more assurance to policy makers that wages growth overall remain fairly well under control mr redican said
3969302 the annual growth over the last year at around 3 75 to 4 per cent shouldnt really provide any alarm to policy makers
3969303 the fact that they didnt suggests that it is a precautionary cut back in spending rather than a really forced cut back mr redican said
3969304 if you expect the unemployment rate to rise over the next year then it will take a fair while before that reflected in lower wages growth
3969305 despite its volatility the rba will take some comfort that the growth in this measure has moderated and is now closer to the more reliable wage cost index data released yesterday
3969306 the health and safety of our consumers is paramount and we would like to reassure them that only a small volume of production has been affected
3969307 having this experience under my belt is definitely going to help me
3969308 this is probably the hardest course i ever played in my life
3969309 its fair for this week but i wouldnt want to play here every day
3969310 i just need to keep playing my game and keep believing in myself and ill be right there again

3969313 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the back to school shopping season under way that does not bode well for retailers
3969314 i think there are too many negatives and the negatives are too large for a gasoline price decline to change the story significantly
3969315 i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years
3969316 something isnt right because my car is all jacked up
3969317 its the worst feeling ive ever experienced in my life i could hear my daughter cry
3969318 this little guy came up and said dude im sorry i didnt see you of course you didnt know because youre drunk
3969319 what can you tell a girl why her mom was taken away and comfort her knowing that shell never see her mom again
3969320 i promise to always be here for you whenever you need me
3969321 i know in my heart that youre daddy will do whats best also
3969322 its portable it works i never get a complaint never ever when people first see it they dont believe it they buy it skeptically cynically they cant believe its going to do what i say itll do but they take a chance and they buy it and during the course of the sale somebody will walk past always do and say i got one of those theyre great and its not shills you dont need a shill with something like this
3969323 the company in switzerland that makes the peeler will only supply people who can demonstrate the product theres a minimum number you have to buy and the minimum quantity is far more peelers than one store could handle in 20 years if you saw the peeler hanging up in a store for a walk right past it it has to be demonstrated
3969324 i couldnt sell real estate or cars for example what i like to do is pitch to a crowd draw a crowd together and have them give me their money
3969325 they were pitching their wares shoelaces cough mixture all kinds of things they were mostly men a lot older than myself but very good at their game they were showmen
3969326 when youre down low people walking past can see the backs of people but they dont know what theyre looking at they have to stop and look to see what those people are looking at
3969327 people say how can you make any money selling something for a dollar you sell a lot thats how there was a fellow in trafalgar square who sold packets of birdseed to the tourists they were a shilling a packet to feed the pigeons he owned blocks of flats so the story goes
3969328 this is the most beautiful building ive ever seen in new york if i dreamed about it and thought i could make my own place in new york this is how it would be its a masterpiece
3969329 has very few buildings of architectural significance so this was a real opportunity if you were into design and light and air and all the things that richard meier is about
3969330 it was wonderful and very unusual to be able to see what the view is like before the building is up
3969331 for me the restaurant which will be very bohemian and unfussy a kind of workingmans place is connected to this piazza
3969332 its like youre in budapest or another eastern european city i think this square should have restaurants all around it and then id like to put a fountain in the center
3969333 the idea for pastis is to make it a deceptively simple place and in that way it is different from balthazar
3969334 there will be no reservations here basic food and it will go later until about three or four a m and there will be hardly any wines its all very informal in keeping with the context outside but the service will be much better than you expect when you see the menus printed on the paper tablecloths
3969335 i like layers and i like for things to be just slightly askew
3969336 all these are very very old some of them recovered from a hotel in cape may new jersey and some from an old factory in tribeca so you see they dont match which no one will notice but which i think is great
3969337 but having said that i do tend to get caught up in the minutiae
3969338 i am constantly having them redo things to get it just the way i picture it
3969339 the workmen are somewhat dismayed but if it doesnt look right to me i cant leave it
3969340 ive got a juggernaut of a thing with an army of workers and plumbers and electricians and i dont have a grand idea of how its going to work out i have this rough idea of how it will work out and i discuss it with someone usually my friend and co designer ian mcpheely and then i get closer and closer its trial and error until its right in front of me i ask everybody who walks in the door even the postman what they think and i probably end up going with my first instinct but thats the way i do it half the time i feel i am trying to dock the q e 2 blindfolded
3969341 as a teenager i worked in the london meat district as a clerk at smithfield
3969342 and this neighborhood somewhat reminded me of that perhaps thats why i am attracted to it
3969343 its nice that they take an interest in the place
3969344 when it was just a bare room they didnt care but tonight the plumber brought his wife to see the sink and the antique urinals because he and everyone else they are part of it i love that
3969345 until i got to know him and then i became a tremendous admirer and a great friend but that was towards the end before when we were both working on lincoln center we used to scream at each other he was a good soul but i never did know why he was so gruff
3969346 he was a highly intelligent man probably exceptionally intelligent but he was emotionally immature
3969347 i know something about his youth but i have no idea what the dynamics were i always thought it was a good thing that he and his wife nina didnt have any children because he wasnt emotionally mature enough to look after children
3969348 he did have a certain social chip on his shoulder
3969349 and you know he was tubby he was a short fat man and i think he was conscious of this however he was always very well turned out hair in a crew cut immaculate tailored suits from brooks brothers
3969350 of all you brothers your grandfather always thought you were the most like him
3969351 there is little doubt that mr rockefellers chief reason for playing golf is that he may live longer to make more money
3969352 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for halloween perhaps
3969353 the next item that will probably be sold on ebay at a start price of 99c and of course with no reserve

3969395 the appropriate role for the federal government is to move as quickly as it can to put in place the new industrial legislation and to urge all parties including telstra to live in the real world to recognise the fact that circumstances have changed and to act in good faith he said
3969396 telstra has not acted in an honest way they have sought to camouflage their intentions here
3969397 we want work choices to be got rid of as soon as possible mr lawrence said
3969398 but we also understand that the federal government has a complex task in dismantling work choices in putting in place a whole new industrial system it is a difficult task
3969399 where is the balance here where is the fairness he said
3969400 all we are asking is telstra to be open with us and its employees and put its cards on the table
3969401 of course we looked at the companys options if union negotiations broke down and they did mr barr said
3969402 of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia

3969492 the reason we would never do it is because there are too many other reality shows that have gotten celebrities theyve had im a celebrity get me out of here which would be what big brother would turn out to be about
3969493 its not paris hilton dealing with her dog its about people looking at life and themselves i dont know if you can get celebrities to do that
3969494 the game forces people to look at themselves in the mirror people tend to learn more about their lives and themselves in the house

3969507 but how many people get to go to the olympics we went out and did the best we could
3969508 we did everything we could to set it up we feel when we hit that dive we are the best in the world we told ourselves to just have fun and do it but i went a little short of vertical i kicked a little early probably wanting it too much and we had to watch the other guys on the podium
3969509 this is our first olympics we are new to this
3969510 we definitely want to continue diving we just have to work out the logistics of it
3969511 you cant do both im staying behind the other countries because i dont have the funding i am fortunate my business partner took it on for me or i wouldnt be here

3969517 our customer base has shown resilience to the general weakening of the north american economy as our order backlog remains solid and new contract activity continues in our downstream business which is a leading indicator for our mill demand
3969518 this combined with import levels which have been moderated from historical highs global steel demand remaining strong and relatively low inventory levels throughout the north american system gives us a positive outlook for the coming months
3969519 we will now need to review the full range of our relations
3969520 i dont think were going to re ignite the cold war here with russia i dont see this is a return to nuclear standoffs

3969578 its the imbalance of supply and demand which causes prices to go down but its ultimately the valuation process of the use of the commodity which tells you where the bottom is
3969579 for example the grain markets can have a huge excess of corn or wheat but the price never goes to zero itll stabilize at some level of prices where people are willing to hold the excess inventory we have little history but the same thing is surely true in housing as well we will get to the point where there will be willing holders of vacant single family dwellings and that will no longer act to depress the price level

3969587 to call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mindset that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past

3969589 we are deeply concerned over the deteriorating situation in the indian occupied kashmir which is resulting in loss of life and property of the kashmiri people and violation of their human rights

3969646 but ninth and 10th are definitely not because there can be a four round swing any given weekend in drag racing so you want to have an eight round cushion if you have two races to go twenty points are awarded for each round win during eliminations
3969647 i said this before the western swing that we were going to need to get 10 or 11 round wins minimum to have a good shot at staying in the top 10
3969648 after going nine races without a round win to get round wins at every race of the last four is very rewarding
3969649 its interesting the goal is always to win races but really a more important goal for the next two races is to win rounds and preserve that top 10 spot wed just like to win four rounds each race

3969699 ada yang mengatakan ia dulu pernah dicuri diculik saat masih kecil lalu diketemukan maka kemudian dinamai dengan
3969700 aku tidak mengetahui ada seorang pun yang lebih gandrung dengan menuntut ilmu di seluruh jagad ini dari masruq
3969701 para teman abdullah yang membacakan al qur an kepada manusia dan mengajarkan mereka as sunnah adalah alqamah al aswad ubaidah masruq al harits bin qais dan amr bin syurahabil
3969702 aku tidak dapat mendahulukan seorang pun atas masruq untuk shalat di belakang abu bakar
3969703 ia sorang tabii yang tsiqah salah seorang shahabat abdullah yang membacakan al qur an kepada manusia dan berfatwa bila sudah shalat kedua kakinya biasanya pasti bengkak
3969704 masruq biasa menutup tirai antara dirinya dan keluarganya lalu menyongsong shalatnya membiarkan mereka dan dunia mereka
3969705 suatu hari di musim panas pernah masruq bin al ajda pingsan karena berpuasa
3969706 khalid bin abdullah bin as penguasa bashrah memberikan hadiah kepada pamanku masruq 30 ribu dirham dinar red padahal waktu itu ia amat membutuhkannya namun ia tidak mau menerimanya
3969707 masruq bertemu denganku lalu berkata hai said tidak ada sesuatu yang tersisa untuk disukai kecuali kita memolesi wajah dengan tanah
3969708 sesungguhnya allah telah membeli dari orang orang mumin diri dan harta mereka dengan memberikan surga untuk mereka
3969709 masruq pernah ditanyai tentang sebuah bait syair maka ia berkata aku tidak suka tidak mendapatkan satu syair pun dalam lembaranku
3969710 telah sampai berita kepadaku bahwa masruq pernah memegang tangan putra saudaranya keponakannya lalu membawanya menemui para tukang sapunya di kufah seraya berkata tidakkah aku tunjukkan dunia kepada kalian
3969711 ia meriwayatkan dari ubai bin kab khabbab bin al aratt zaid bin tsabit abdullah bin umar bin al khaththab abdullah bin amr bin al ash abdullah bin masud ubaid bin umair al laitsi yang merupakan teman semasanya utsman bin affan ali bin abu thalib umar bin al khaththab muadz bin jabal maqil bin sinan al mughirah bin syubah abu bakar bin ash shiddiq sabiah al aslamiah aisyah isteri nabi saw ummur ruman ummu salamah isteri nabi saw
3969712 orang orang yang meriwayatkan darinya adalah ibrahim anas bin sirin abu wa il syaqiq bin salamah amir abdullah bin murrah al khariqi abdurrahman bin abdullah bin masud ubaid bin nadhlah imarah bin umair al qasim bin al muntasyir bin al ajda dan muhammad bin al muntasyir al hamadani abu adh dhuha muslim bin shubaih makmahul asy syami yahya bin al jazzar yahya bin witsab abu al ahwash al jasymi abu ishaq abu al muharibi dan isterinya qumair binti amr
3969713 sungguh pantas seseorang memiliki banyak majlis di mana ia dapat menyepi sehingga dapat mengingat dosa dosanya lalu memita ampun kepada allah
3969714 pernah masruq memberikan pertolongan kepada seorang laki laki mengupayakan pengampunan untuknya lalu orang itu memberinya hadiah seorang budak wanita maka marahlah ia seraya berkata andaikata aku tahu bahwa hal ini yang ada di dalam jiwamu niscaya aku tidak akan berbicara tentangnya dan tidak akan berbicara tentang apa yang tersisa darinya sama sekali

3969734 our system is very effective and quebec is way ahead of other provinces when it comes to organ donation

3969761 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3969762 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3969763 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3969764 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3969765 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3969766 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3969767 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3969768 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3969769 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3969770 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3969771 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3969772 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3969773 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3969774 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3969775 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3969776 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3969777 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3969778 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3969779 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3969780 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3969781 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3969782 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3969783 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3969784 we have a great training staff also the players we come even if were not hurt and get extra things done a lot of guys do that we dont really get hurt because we take care of our bodies
3969785 theirs is a commitment on their part and how they take care of themselves
3969786 how they recover how they rest how they eat all those types of things contribute to that as well
3969787 were so used to each other and we know the offense the calls the schemes
3969788 were being cohesive getting better each day everything goes a little smoother
3969789 there is a little excitement in each and every one of us that two a days are over

3969801 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3969802 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

3969817 i used to sit at home with my friends in high school and watch kentucky fried movie and airplane and vomit from laughing
3969818 then 9 11 happened and i couldnt take it anymore
3969819 the response to 9 11 the right was saying this is pure evil were facing and the left was saying how are we at fault for this
3969820 if he had been a republican president we would have demanded his resignation and marched on the
3969821 when 9 11 happened i knew democrats wouldnt be strong enough to fight this war
3969822 this morning i had another talk with the german chancellor herr hitler here is the paper which bears his name upon it as well as mine

3969825 as he says this he rolls his eyes and moves his right hand across his body to indicate a car going off a cliff
3969826 i figured he was like everyone else in hollywood a democrat
3969827 and we knew that this was not a democrat movie
3969828 we were afraid that he would not want to be involved in something that was so directly taking on the left and that he would not want to play the michael moore character
3969829 i thought that the minute we started talking about politics that would be the end
3969830 there was this dance that we did a dance familiar to conservative actors in hollywood lots of actors have done it
3969831 i usually just bite my tongue unless it gets too ridiculous
3969832 the only thing that really bothers me is when they go off about the president it just gets annoying

3969834 im glad some of the bigger guys jumped in dennis hopper jon voight james woods
3969835 the accepted way to speak about america is in the voice that disrespects it and the voice thats unacceptable is the one that loves america
3969836 petraeus has to couch every bit of optimism in some convoluted formulation to avoid the promised rush of disrespect
3969837 no one on the left wants to admit that radical islamists want to kill americans the jews everyone in the west
3969838 i try to talk to my friends on the left and they just dont get it most of them have never even heard of how can you have an intellectual discussion about the war were in without knowing who sayyid qutb is
3969839 once they found out i was a republican unfortunately for some people it was a problem
3969840 its almost like people who are gay show up at the baths and say oh i didnt know you were gay
3969841 its too dark outside the sun is not the answer
3969842 we really didnt have to do a lot of stretching
3969843 radical christianity is just as threatening as radical islam in a country like america where we have a separation of church and state
3969844 obama is not qualified to be president and itll be a disaster
3969845 i dont think that obama is an evil guy i just think hes wrong but i do think we face real evil in ahmadinejad and the mullahs and all these crazy guys
3969846 john kerry was and obama is fortunately kerry was a stiff but obama isnt a stiff and hes really adaptable hes like a really clever virus who adapts obamas the farthest left of all of these guys and thats why he associated with all of those crazies terrorists preachers of hate
3969847 when i look at the other side when i look at barack obama i see expediency
3969848 hes like family i could never disown him i didnt know him i didnt hear those words in that church
3969849 its a movie its a satire and its a funny satire i dont want to point to this thing just because there are so few films from conservative sources and make it a target its a movie lets not burden this little horse with additional weights

3969868 oil sands are one of the worlds dirtiest sources of fuel and have a major impact on the environment
3969869 their extraction cannot be described as a sustainable process and for shell to claim otherwise is wholly misleading
3969870 but also the development of vast resources of unconventional oil and gas such as oil sands
3969871 the asas decision to uphold wwfs complaint sends a strong signal to business and industry that greenwash is unacceptable
3969872 oil sands are an incredibly destructive source of energy and along with the expansion of shells oil refining capacity in texas cannot be considered a sustainable way to meet the worlds future energy needs
3969873 if shell were serious about sourcing sustainable energy then they would be far better placed investing in renewable energy such as wind tidal or solar power
3969874 hosting these solar and wind projects will add to our knowledge of the benefits and potential applications of renewable energy programs at our facilities
3969875 together with the energy saving initiatives we already have in place in our stores and distribution centers this is another significant step toward achieving our environmental objectives with enthusiastic support from jcpenney associates nationwide we are constantly looking for opportunities to contribute to a cleaner environment and run our business more cost effectively
3969876 these projects further our commitment to incorporate sustainability into all aspects of our operations we will closely monitor the results to determine how we can best leverage these innovative methods to increase our participation in renewable energy projects while also benefiting our business
3969877 we are proud of what we are accomplishing as an organization to reduce energy consumption and extend jcpenneys legacy of social responsibility and our associates remain focused on seeking new ways to protect the

3969948 the institution of marriage will be weakened resulting in negative consequences for both adults and children
3969949 traditional marriage is essential to society as a whole and especially to its children
3969950 abortion has taken the lives of over 45 million innocents
3969951 the churchs opposition to same sex marriage neither constitutes nor condones any kind of hostility towards homosexual men and women protecting marriage between a man and a woman does not affect church members christian obligations of love kindness and humanity toward all people
3969952 only a man and a woman together have the natural biological capacity to conceive children
3969953 legally protected because only a male and female together can create new life and because the rearing of children requires a life long commitment which marriage is intended to provide
3969954 marriage and family are vital instruments for rearing children and teaching them to become responsible adults
3969955 by definition all same sex unions are infertile and two individuals of the same gender whatever their affections can never form a marriage devoted to raising their own mutual offspring
3969956 extensive studies have shown that in general a husband and wife united in a loving committed marriage provide the optimal environment for children to be protected nurtured and raised
3969957 in an ideal society every child would be raised by both a father and a mother
3969958 the substantial personal resources that two parents can bring to bear on raising a child
3969959 the all important question of public policy must be what environment is best for the child and for the rising generation
3969960 no exposure of womens private parts on a global scale could make satan happier
3969961 how come modern sports especially womens sports involve the exposure of private parts it is well known that the olympics both in the past and the upcoming games the worlds worst display of womens clothing is the womens olympics no exposure of womens private parts on a global scale could make satan happier than olympic games that include womens sports
3969962 yes it is an enormous satanic issue many people nowadays watch sports rather than participate in them
3969963 if only they would run or move their bodies a little all they do is sit and watch the sports channels
3969964 wrestling involves the exposure of womens private parts even the promotion of the competitions is done by scantily clad women this is done at the beginning of the match in the middle and at the end or so i hear the matches are promoted by half naked women
3969965 beijing or not i call it bikini anyway because they are likely to display women in the worst possible way in these bikini olympic games
3969966 what women wear in the olympic games are among the worst clothes possible

3969969 u s out of iraq now money for human needs not for war say no to the republican agenda demand peace justice and equality
3969970 the stage is now set for the sept 1 protest the issuance of the permit is a major step to guarantee that everyone who wants to come out to say no to the continued war and occupation of iraq everyone who wants funds used for housing health care and human needs instead of an endless war everyone who wants to speak out for peace and justice has a place to be on sept 1 while the republican politicians gather the majority of the population who are against the war will have a place to gather to send a clear anti war message
3969971 this permit is really the result of a two year long struggle with the city of saint paul to make sure that there is a place at or near the republican convention for all those who have suffered from and who oppose the policies of the bush administration to gather and speak out
