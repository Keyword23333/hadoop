4090013 together theyve built an overall strategy for consistency and given our teams in the plants the tools they need to deliver vehicles are designed for quality and the plants have the necessary tools to deliver that quality in the manufacturing process
4090014 i see the recent 1 2 billion in worldwide warranty cost savings as a billion reasons to continue down this path

4090046 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people

4090071 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4090072 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4090073 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4090074 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4090075 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4090076 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4090077 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4090078 i understand mistakes can happen the concern now is how it could wreck my life
4090079 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4090080 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4090081 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4090082 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit
4090083 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4090084 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4090085 i cant believe how well i did in the 400m freestyle
4090086 my target was just to do a best time in the 800m and beat what i did at trials
4090087 i just wanted to get in and do a pb
4090088 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4090089 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4090090 there is reason to believe that wal mart stores inc has made prohibited corporate expenditures by expressly advocating against senator obamas election to employees
4090091 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
4090092 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
4090093 for years wal mart has been intimidating and harassing its workers who want to form unions
4090094 now theyve adapted their union busting tactics to influence our federal election system

4090126 concerns about the us economy and now the spread of the economic slowdown to europe and asia could push crude oil pricing to test lower lows because some of the supply issues have been discounted by the market

4090135 im a little bit tired and i have a full day to recover
4090136 i cant believe it after the relay i could have sunk but i told myself that after all these years of hard work i cant let myself go down my legs were shaking at the start i was really tense just like the other seven guys
4090137 to bounce back from that relay takes a lot of guts and he showed that today
4090138 full credit to him he swam a better race and the better man won on the day
4090139 the most important thing is being able to separate the two events and just move on ive trained for it im used to it the biggest part for me in the psychological part

4090156 there was a 2 minute delay so the world feed could get alicias routine into the world feed
4090157 that was unfortunate but it is not unusual the hold could have had an effect on alicia
4090158 i have no way to know it possibly could be possibly not
4090159 i told her alicia they tried to break your focus you let them do that never let them do that we work on that
4090160 in my opinion it was an attempt to break concentration thats exactly what happened
4090161 unfortunately she is the type of gymnast who is very emotional
4090162 they fought with true american spirit on paper it looked like the other countries were stronger than us many people didnt believe after qualifiers they would be on the podium
4090163 i definitely was calculating everything in my head after the hamm brothers came off the team
4090164 but i didnt recalculate it and put myself in the situation i knew raj should have been on the team to begin with and i knew sasha would help them on the pommel horse
4090165 ive learned a lot about my body how to develop it to the level i need to
4090166 they do their own singing and their own dancing in the film
4090167 you get the opportunity to see both of these guys go for it in a real way thats fun and energetic mac definitely can carry a tune he does a great falsetto in the movie and a baritone and alto as well he has a range he plays a range of emotions in the film as well as octaves
4090168 when i came on they asked do you want him in the movie and i was like of course not to include him in the movie would have been sacrilege i had to have isaac in the film
4090169 when i went to shake his hand and tell him how much i loved him and what a great job he did he hugged me back and looked me in the eye and said make a great film man
4090170 i started remembering my dad did this movie called putney swope i was in new york at that time and the character was supposed to be a vietnam soldier so i was remembering some of the folks who were hanging out in the west village back then
4090171 without it being too specific i just started this gravelly cool very world weary voice and i said oh my god im going to have a ball with this
4090172 i laid the voice on stiller and he laughed and i thought you know hes just laughing to make me feel ok and then hes going to change it all when we get there
4090173 he was really improvising a lot of the time and there was a little bit of a question like is that intelligible
4090174 we did some looping too but it really was who the character was and what he was playing the idea of this australian guy playing this black guy and his interpretation of that that was always what we were satirizing the idea of to try to be taken seriously
4090175 i think this is going to be a big coming out party for him as a comedian
4090176 you knew he was a great actor with chaplin but all of the films hes made were great dramatic films this is the first one where its been full blown comedy and his skills are sharp
4090177 life is too goddamn serious things are scary i got to laugh my ass off in this movie ill take that over rocket science any day and ill certainly take that over self important dramatist
4090178 we provided intake documentation and the judge said it was insufficient
4090179 the judge said he should have informed the court sooner and because it was the second time hed missed court in this case she issued the warrant
4090180 working towards getting him some help and we hope that will be taken seriously by all parties in this case
4090181 he qualified for us and he feels comfortable with me
4090182 we have to work out an arrangement that will work with the courts
4090183 we are in court again next week on other matters and my hope is we can get the warrant resolved by then and get back on track we have some things in the works to get the warrant taken care of my hope is that we can resolve it without an arrest but hes been arrested at the airport before so they obviously have an eye out for him so im not sure
4090184 madonna has not made an attempt to adopt this baby earlier this year or now
4090185 staring at brittny gastineau while she was waiting in line for the bathroom
4090186 he is a dreamboat if i were that age and single id be in so much trouble
4090187 i said youd be exactly my type he liked it he was like that would be great i was of course teasing but of course not teasing
4090188 hes so nice and grounded and sweet as can be hes the real deal hes a teen idol
4090189 she was great shes a very normal 15 year old girl and i guess that makes her extraordinary considering the circumstances
4090190 she works hard and shes got a good attitude i think with the right direction and the right choices she can do some great things
4090191 hes a very nice guy and we had a real good time together
4090192 shes such a different character than jan shes earthy with no ulterior motives
4090193 you know shell either be a great mother or be the greatest example of what not to be as a mother
4090194 itll be interesting to see michael and jan now they always have a power struggle he had it all last season and now shes got it back again and it keeps them an interesting couple
4090195 when it is known that a sex offender convicted in another country is to be deported to the uk he is met at the port of entry by police who interview him and pass any relevant information to the police in the area in which the offender is proposing to live
4090196 im pretty sure riddler gets his shot ed nigma gets his moment
4090197 its a very very awesome prison i majored in architecture in college and design is how i actually started in for super max designing that prison it had to be the kind of thing that was a character in and of itself
4090198 were in a world where instead of just trying to contain a guy whos really big youre trying to contain a guy who can in the case of icicle who can freeze things what kind of a cell would a guy like that need in order to have his powers neutralized so to escape from super max they have got to go through the most elaborate heist weve ever seen involving superpowers because the prison itself kind of has superpowers
4090199 what we wanted to do and i think well continue to do as the studio continues to push the movie forward is to be able to put queen in the center of a much bigger universe
4090200 in the same way that marvel is starting to do when youre in the filmed dc universe where this world and this world and this world they all exist in an interrelated web its the kind of thing that i think absolutely is about spelling out a couple different roads for a couple different characters
4090201 by the time a movie like this comes out we will all understand origin stories and mainstream audiences now are willing to suspend their disbelief to the point that we can believe that a world exists where superpowers exist and people dress up in costumes so now what now what do we do and i call this superhero 2 0
4090202 we do deal with his origin hes got a very interesting origin with a desert island and everything else but we get to the core of green arrow not by showing where he starts but by pushing him into a key moment in his life where everything he has is lost and hes got to earn it all back i think for audiences its going to be a great way to get to know a new character
4090203 tomorrow the new record releases its just a really amazing time in our lives
4090204 were so excited were going to go to virgin megastore across the street and wait in line a little bit longer
4090205 we do anything for our fans and we owe everything we have to them
4090206 we cant tell what were performing but it will be our second single
4090207 when i was growing up i had a pretty difficult time
4090208 i just found when i was introducing myself to people it was a little awkward
4090209 you get all those wee wee jokes and that sort of thing
4090210 he e mailed me right away and said holy sh the nintendo is named after you
4090211 the reason my parents chose that is because they didnt really have a name picked out when my mom was pregnant
4090212 i thought it was weird nintendo would go with that
4090213 now when i meet people i say my name is wii
4090214 oh wii are you going to go home to play with yourself
4090215 protecting the integrity of our nations critical infrastructure is among ices highest priorities
4090216 when individuals use fraudulent social security numbers to get jobs they hide their true identity and history we need to know who is working on our critical infrastructure sites
4090217 its actually been really fun weve been listening to our ipods and i slept for a lot of the time weve been just keeping each other busy
4090218 it seems like time goes by so slow because im so excited
4090219 i really like spending time with my kids theyre really good girls and the jonas brothers are just awesome theyre darlings
4090220 its kind of cool to be a part of it its good to see people so excited about a band
4090221 i want you to sing this with me as loud as you can
4090222 but im already starting to get the ideas and the aesthetics and everything and its very different from 2006s the black parade
4090223 its hard to say at this point but musically how black parade tapped into the glam classic rock of queen and ziggy stardust this taps into something different not punk but maybe in its proto sense the aesthetic it is extremely different and it is more stripped down too when we get a chance were going to get together and do some demos and start rolling but were going to take it slow i feel like we needed to be away for a while people need to kind of miss us because there was a point in the last two and a half years where you could have seen us at least once a month if you wanted
4090224 its weird sometimes you give interviews and they catch you in a weird mood on the road and youre like nah i didnt say it was going to be a more punk rock record i just thought it would be more stripped of the bells and whistles
4090225 i think it is more urban im working with producers who are just amazing
4090226 id rather not but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to
4090227 id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
4090228 id love to if i can find the right movie
4090229 were just trying to work it out with my schedule with the children
4090230 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
4090231 it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit but it was really cool and she was happy
4090232 britney and kevin wanted to settle but there were issues of how much time we wanted and there was an upcoming court hearing scheduled
4090233 i would have gone out there but i dont know how effective i would have been
4090234 they said he threw the ball pretty decent hes building arm strength still
4090235 you feel like your hearts going to bust your hamstrings are going to pop out its the hardest race full speed all the way around
4090236 im usually not nervous but i probably will be for the olympics
4090237 i just have so much confidence and i see how hard she trains see how well she takes care of her body i just feel like shes ready for this situation
4090238 shes been waiting for it for four years so that was huge
4090239 on any given day anybody can win especially in track you can fall you can slip pull up anything anything can happen you cant take it for granted
4090240 the reason last season was such a wonderful thing was that it was great for football it is the all american success story
4090241 the greatest thing about it is that nobody expected it we can go all the way back and talk about the parade and why the people were the way they were they were ecstatic and they were hanging off buildings nobody worked it was because no one expected it
4090242 then i heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels go and pour out the bowls of the wrath of god on the earth so the first went and poured out his bowl upon the earth and a foul and loathesome sore most likely boils exodus 9 9 11 came upon the men who had the mark of the beast and those who worshipped the image then the second angel poured out his bowl on the sea and it became blood as of a dead man and every living creature in the sea died then the third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water and they became blood and i heard the angel of the waters saying you are righteous o lord the one who is and who was and who is to be because you have judged these things for they shed the blood of saints and prophets an you have given them blood to drink for it is their just due and i heard another from the altar saying even so lord god almighty true and righteous are your judgments then the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun and power was given him to scorch men with fire and men were scorched with great heat and they blasphemed the name of god who has power over these plagues and they did not repent and give him glory

4090249 we havent had this type of outbreak in a while
4090250 everything has been early then nothing to get double digit runs means we have a lot of people contributing offensively thats huge for us
4090251 despite having recent seizures more than one out of three adults reported not seeing a neurologist or epilepsy specialist in the past year these findings suggest that adults with uncontrolled seizures may not be receiving the optimal medical treatment they need and may face substantial impairments in their daily activities
4090252 while epilepsy is one of the most common neurological conditions most people know very little about this disorder or how to support those with epilepsy
4090253 we hope this report which provides the largest and most comprehensive data on epilepsy in the united states can help states and public health agencies better understand the prevalence of epilepsy as well as epilepsy associated conditions and limitations
4090254 donors who died from cardiocirculatory causes offer an opportunity to reduce waiting time and waiting list mortality among children whose survival depends on a heart transplant
4090255 i dont know how you can ever have a patient that meets the criteria for irreversible loss of function and then reverse that function in someone else
4090256 if death means irreversible loss of cardiac function and that heart beats in someone elses chest its not irreversible is it
4090257 with such consent there is no harm or wrong done in retrieving vital organs before death providing that anesthesia is administered with proper safeguards no patient will die from vital organ donation who would not otherwise die as a result of the withdrawal of life support
4090258 some early life exposures such as maternal smoking during pregnancy or personal characteristics may impair the development of physical control and coordination as well as increasing the risk of obesity in later life
4090259 rather than being explained by a single factor an accumulation throughout life of many associated cultural personal and economic exposures is likely to underlie the risks for obesity and some elements of associated neurological function
4090260 what we know is that if you see a very frail person next to somebody not so frail the very frail person is more likely to have alzheimers pathology in their brain when they die
4090261 this is important as we try to wrap our heads around the biology of aging
4090262 because it turns out that as you get older alzheimers pathology signs of its development are really ubiquitous even if that doesnt mean that you actually have dementia so this finding could alter the way most medical and non medical people conceptualize alzheimers as a disease simply of impaired memory and cognition while expanding our view of what it actually means to become frail
4090263 so now we put all this together and it raises the possibility that alzheimers is much more of a public health issue than previously thought if it turns out that being weak is a sign of its onset
4090264 but if so we also now have a clue as to how we can possibly intervene perhaps by treating motor dysfunction years before people develop dementia so that they wont develop dementia as early
4090265 this study really ties together two very common syndromes in aging cognitive processes and motor skills in ways i have not seen them connected before
4090266 so i think this is very important and relevant because it raises the question of whether frailty could be an early manifestation of alzheimers disease the study doesnt necessarily answer the question and this is something they now have to go about proving but already for me that idea is a whole new thought that will push me to look at my patients with new eyes
4090267 to put the world in order we must first put the nation in order to put the nation in order we must put the family in order to put the family in order we must cultivate our personal life and to cultivate our personal life we must first set our hearts right

4090272 id rather there be a federal solution than a state solution just as a matter of efficiency
4090273 our physician recruiter survey results document what weve heard from physicians in recent years about the growing importance of lifestyle factors in choosing medical practice opportunities
4090274 for example 79 percent of this years respondents said their organizations offer physicians some type of job flexibility to assist with recruitment efforts
4090275 these factors do not come into play for men who overall are 7 percent more likely to cheat than women
4090276 the likelihood of a man having had an affair increases with age and reaches a peak when a man is about 55 years old it then decreases with age for women the peak is 45 years old
4090277 the benefits of female infidelity reduce after the age of 40 because a woman would no longer benefit in terms of improved gene quality from the affair
4090278 men also experience a reduction of sperm quality around the age of 45 but the reproductive benefits of an affair extend further into a mans lifetime than a womans
4090279 who are you how many hit records do you have

4090289 we used to think air pollution was a problem that primarily affects the lungs we now know it is also bad for the heart
4090290 air pollution can be dangerous at levels that are within the accepted air quality standards
4090291 patients with cardiovascular disease shouldnt exercise outside on days with increased air pollution levels on very polluted days they should consider staying inside and during the winter they should limit exposure to fireplace smoke
4090292 of course the real solution is to reduce air pollution
4090293 are filling a big need for low income women and providing a really important service
4090294 there are still a lot of women not getting all the services they need
4090295 this suggests that private providers are beginning to focus on the contraceptive needs of women
4090296 since the advent of title x a federal program established in 1970 under president richard nixon to fund family planning and preventive health services publicly funded clinics have always focused on contraceptive access pregnancy testing and std related care

4090298 after extensive monitoring estimated exposures to golfers following full applications of two turfgrass insecticides that are used throughout the northeastern united states were 19 to 68 times lower than levels set by the u s environmental protection agency designed to protect human health
4090299 because of the large amount of time people spend in turf environments exposure to pesticides from treated turf is a potentially significant exposure pathway
4090300 what one can say is that for people with chronic stable coronary disease pci can be deferred
4090301 they can continue on medication aimed at their specific risk factors hypertension lipid disorders diabetes and should be encouraged to have a good lifestyle with exercise smoking cessation and weight control
4090302 if people say my pain is so bad i cant function that is one thing
4090303 if people say i have angina but im doing ok thats another
4090304 pci adds about 10 000 without any significant gain in years of survival or quality of life
4090305 but when a doctor talks to a patient the doctor is an advocate for that patient
4090306 paying the cost out of pocket gives one a different point of view
4090307 until that category is changed the effect of this study will be modest
4090308 we have justified angioplasty for years by saying it is of great benefit to patients
4090309 this study shows no survival benefit and shows that the benefit in regard to symptom relief is temporary medical therapy should be considered for all patients with stable angina unless they have severe pain when diagnosed
4090310 healthy people can have reasonably satisfying sexual health for most of their lives
4090311 there are challenges that arise but its not aging per se thats the issue a decline in sexuality may be the canary in the mineshaft sexual problems may manifest before diabetes and high blood pressure
4090312 sexual health is a harbinger of physical and mental health and it plays an important role in the quality of life
4090313 older people dont just drop out of the picture in general if youre healthy you can be sexually active
4090314 dont assume that because youre older your sex life has to be gone if youre healthy and connected to someone and youve had a pretty good sex life when youre younger then you can have a pretty good sex life in old age
4090315 the gradient of time in the country and being born in the country or outside the country has a lot to do with how people perceive and experience the health care system and especially the deficits of that system
4090316 if you compare these numbers to those from the u s centers for disease control and prevention latinos are more than twice as likely to lack a usual health care provider
4090317 we found a number of characteristics of health care access that are particular to latinos
4090318 among people who have health insurance 19 percent lacked a usual health care provider compared to 42 percent of people who lack health insurance
4090319 this suggests that its not only financial reasons that are keeping latinos from doctors
4090320 among those people who reported they were not satisfied with their health care the most common reason why they received poor health care was financial
4090321 they felt that their health care professional did not provide good care because they did not have the means to pay for the health care
4090322 about a third of hispanics get their medical information from doctors
4090323 encouraging all genetic testing to require supervision by a qualified health care professional ensures they are being properly used and the results are being accurately interpreted and understood by patients
4090324 tibolone which is used around the world for menopausal symptoms decreases the risk of fractures decreases the risk of breast cancer but increases the risk of stroke in this group of women who are all over the age of 60
4090325 for older women you should stop taking tibolone or not consider starting it
4090326 women who are having menopausal symptoms in their 50s can continue to take tibolone because it is relatively safe and also does have other benefits such as a reduction in the risk of fracture and breast cancer
4090327 it will not be available in the united states because the company is not asking the u s food and drug administration to approve it
4090328 all drugs that are being used for menopausal symptoms all have positives and negatives the task is to find drugs that dont have problems
4090329 for the u s consumer its sort of a moot point
4090330 it tibolone is not the magic bullet but i think its another drug that could potentially be used if it ever does get fda approval my caution would be that its potentially helpful but its not a slam dunk that its better than what we have been using
4090331 the hayes family is comfortable with dr kraus recommendation to not conduct an autopsy

4090333 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state

4090338 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this

4090346 to call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mind set that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past
4090347 this matter of kashmir is not indias internal affair it is as much a matter for pakistan as it is for kashmiris
4090348 that would also create ground for us to return to the negotiating table
4090349 i have always been here before the roky erickson anthology
4090350 the biggest issue is still bringing the offensive line together i will recognize jason pinkston and joe thomas both played well in the scrimmage offensive line is an area where we have to be good to have success on offense
4090351 everyone is hurt and beat up right now if you let your mind control your body you have a tendency to be soft and think that you cant go on and when you have that mind frame you cant get better as coaches this is when you build that mental toughness and you push them to develop that chemistry of a football team

4090366 we alleged that there was some very purposeful targeting of racial minorities for exploitative loans we alleged that a group of lenders real estate agents appraisers closing agents and others conspired to basically defraud people and entrap them in what i call exploitative mortgages
4090367 she said you dont have to worry about it and i said i have a six year old son i am worried
4090368 dont panic and dont stress just pay your payments to the clerk of the courts at least do that
4090369 theres a time and place for everything and now is the time

4090371 it was always turmoil between our camp and his camp us as the bosses of our companies everyone is gonna follow our lead wed figure if it aint no problem and we dont have no issues no beef then theres no reason we shouldnt be able to get together and make music that was an executive decision that was made on both our behalves
4090372 i was surprised just as much as everybody else was
4090373 i talked to luda and he said it was time to sit down do business make grown man moves both of them got albums coming out time to try new things cris did something for t i too that nobody heard yet its about to come out soon its a good move
4090374 its showing that once great minds set their differences aside they can make something happen
4090375 thats two grown men not two grown males grown men

4090397 its a fact that tisha is the most competitive girl i know
4090398 thats probably why we gel so well together we push each other to greater heights in whatever we do

4090433 singh is which released last week is still going strong and would be the first choice of family audiences during the festival weekend
4090434 bachna ae is only for the young audience vis vis god tussi which is a film for the masses because of salman khans presence
4090435 there has also been no pre release tempo preceding both the films even their music has not made a mark in comparison to the music of singh is kinng that is still driving people crazy
4090436 there is a good pre release response to all the three movies however it is true that singh is is still managing high sales
4090437 singh is going strong in its second week and is expected to keep on garnering sales but we have divided our screens equally for all the three movies
4090438 we are expecting a good business with bachna ae because of the yash raj banner in comparison to god tussi but singh is is still getting us business of around 70 percent even on weekdays
4090439 nothing affects the ticket sales it is tough but it depends on the film if an individual has to go for a film then he or she will definitely go for it come what may
4090440 i dont fear any movie there is nobody greater than god and i have my faith in him my movie is commercial but different the audience would come to know of it when they will watch it
4090441 there are a lot of expectations from both the movies both are big projects and have big stars it would be a great holiday period and the movies are expected to do great business

4090443 unlike some other health care trend surveys aon consultings survey reports the expected future increase in employer provided health plan claims cost before any plan changes based on the opinions of health plan actuaries
4090444 we provide this trend data to help employers evaluate the competitiveness of health insurance premium renewals for employers with self funded health plans this trend data helps them and their actuaries develop future claim estimates for budgeting purposes
4090445 but more must be done to truly stem the tide of rising health care costs
4090446 this includes greater senior management support for these programs better employee communications and more consistent cooperation from the medical community
4090447 el derecho a la vida desde la concepci n hasta la muerte natural es un derecho fundamental de todas las personas el no resguardarlo pone en grave peligro el reconocimiento del resto de nuestros derechos es por esto que recurrimos a ustedes para que desempe en adecuadamente su labor de legislar
4090448 protecting the integrity of our nations critical infrastructure is among ices highest priorities
4090449 when individuals use fraudulent social security numbers to get jobs they hide their true identity and history we need to know who is working on our critical infrastructure sites
4090450 we want to know how can this happen we want to find out the truth
4090451 the physical evidence the bus the tire tell a story
4090452 its going to tell us what happened in the crash
4090453 when you go up there its not like they put a number on you saying youre hitting fourth today
4090454 weve known about him as a hitter but now hes added some power
4090455 he comes to play hard he come up with big hits
4090456 youre never going to replace any guy on this team you just try to manage when theyre gone
4090457 last night we were able to make it up but tonight you cant keep expecting to try to make that up
4090458 we made it a little more interesting than we needed to
4090459 hes a good athlete it aint on t o though
4090460 first of all t o is 10 times faster than brandon marshall and 10 times stronger than brandon marshall
4090461 you can sometimes get your hand on b at the line t o has a good thing where he snatches and whips i wouldnt say hes nowhere near t o
4090462 if you compare him five six years from now then its a comparison you cant compare them right now t o s one of the top receivers in the league consistently for a reason the guys got tremendous work habits
4090463 hes a big receiver hes very aggressive hell go get the ball and he can make things happen once he gets the ball in his hands
4090464 they have a good guy in brandon hes going to be a guy that will be around here for a while
4090465 and thats some of the problems that we have with sports is just because a guy can run jump and catch its oh he can be this he can be that the 6 inches the muscle between your ears is the most important one
4090466 i said remember just because youve got muscles doesnt mean you have to use them
4090467 and i promise you t o plays a mental game he plays a mental game with dbs he comes off the ball hes kicking their butts on run plays the next thing you know they think its a run its a pass but it looks the same
4090468 and trust me its going to take a lot of work
4090469 i think if your characters better your football plays going to be better
4090470 but how long can he play for the denver broncos is what i want to know
4090471 and thats really up to him because if he gets some things together in his life outside of those gates hes going to be here a long time the stuff i did i expect to see his name on top of those
4090472 i actually got permission to ride with the philadelphia police up and down ridge avenue
4090473 our biggest problem was dismissals kids not doing what theyre supposed to do
4090474 so i cooperated with the 5th district commander with that problems seemed to diminish because they knew somebody was watching them
4090475 the special hearing date will allow the board to conclude the case that day and render its decision promptly
4090476 i think its time to air all these issues before the zoning board and let them make a decision
4090477 to understand a few things but based on the information the jury received it was a fair verdict
4090478 my whole life is in there i have nothing left
4090479 theyre working through it and have been cutting down fencing
4090480 i got a couple of residents here people who were evacuated
4090481 theyre in shock i believe honestly i think theyre all going to go up
4090482 sitting on our front step crying she wont take water its horrible
4090483 theyre up against the size of the fire and getting water resources together to get in front of the fire
4090484 one of uptons most fascinating experiments was to chase the worms off a tree with the flower of a geranium he would take a leaf from the infested tree and lay it on the collector plate alongside a geranium flower when he switched on the transmitter the radiation from the geranium would be keyed to the distant tree and would give the latter some kind of taste or radiation which the worms disliked and which would cause them to hurry to the nearest exit and fall to the ground this usually happened in five minutes and at close range was almost instantaneous but the sturdier the growth the longer it took
4090485 a comprehensive experimental program during 1949 to further determine the possibilities of insect control by radionic processes
4090486 did not provide an adequate basis for estimating the u k a k o process
4090487 organism as a message living organisms have internal self description written in a dna form this description comes from previous generations and summarize the experience of all ancestors in the art of surviving thus an organism has a dual nature it stands for itself and it is also a message sent from all previous generations to all future generations calow 1978 hoffmeyer 1997 this duality is the essential feature of life which makes biological evolution possible differential survival and reproduction of organisms is a semiotic process which incorporates present into the future hoffmeyer 1997 16 characterizes life as survival in a coded form messages that provide better recipes for surviving are reproduced together with organisms whereas messages with poor instructions disappear together with their bearers
4090488 semiotic triads peirce suggested a triadic scheme for a sign which is the relationship between a sign vehicle e g the dinosaur bone an object the dinosaur and interpretant the recognition of the dinosaur from the bone by paleontologist deely 1992 hoffmeyer 1997 applies triads to genetic code by considering the dna as a sign vehicle fertilized egg as interpretant and ontogenetic trajectory as object despite obvious differences between these two examples they both satisfy the conditions of a sign relationship in both cases the sign vehicle triggers the process of building another object the mental model of the dinosaur or the material model of an organism but if an organism is the model then the model of what i think that any organism is a model of its ancestors and as with any other model it may slightly deviate from the original
4090489 a message requires an interpreter and the genetic code is interpreted by each cell in the body the offspring organism is supplied with both the code and interpreter that can read this code and build an organism from it the processes of interpretation of the genetic code organism building are called epigenetic processes thus heredity always has genetic and epigenetic components
4090490 value one of the basic problems in biosemiotics is understanding how something becomes someone hoffmeyer 1997 in other words what is the origin of subjectivity or how a system can start interpreting the world action is the only possible predecessor of interpretation in primitive organisms interpretation is always reduced to some simple action for example the sound of a bat means fall down for a moth and a source of light means move here for unicellular algae organisms also exhibit numerous spontaneous actions which are not induced by any external signal the question is what makes organisms perform all these actions according to physics and chemistry organism activity is predetermined in its structure but this is only a half of an answer or better to say not an answer at all because the next question is why organisms have this specific structure action and structure are two sides of the same thing which can be called organization the explanation of the origin of organization comes from the theory of evolution which in its most general form states that action and structure may form a self stimulating loop based on self reproduction conrad 1983 as a result action and structure are integrated into an organism
4090491 we recognize that in america this is going after somebody who is more comfortable with technology
4090492 the truth is that in other countries its becoming a part of their culture the trend is coming and as a fashion company its very important to identify trends and get ahead of them
4090493 this is about someone whos interested in our brand and interested in technology and wherever the two meet thats whats appropriate
4090494 i turned the discussion from an observation about ibm on twitter into something bigger about ibm in the overall market the question posited is especially to the vast majority of edbrill com readers who affiliate with the lotus software brand what does ibm
4090495 this is my product and the only one i care about
4090496 he had a tantrum and ran out of the meeting
4090497 he had a tantrum and ran out of the meeting
4090498 we see this as an opportunity to bring us together and lift up the country
4090499 we have all tribes on the team and there is no problem
4090500 im running for sudan im running for the whole country and im also doing it for myself
4090501 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4090502 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty
4090503 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4090504 but i still think its a little sore it wasnt bad its just tough to come back from a muscle you use that much
4090505 so against my better judgement i have made todays slightly easier
4090506 no estamos en 1968 en la invasi n de checoslovaquia
4090507 rusia debe cumplir su palabra y poner fin a la crisis
4090508 tambi n estamos preocupados por las informaciones seg n las cuales ciudadanos georgianos de diversas etnias no fueron protegidos
4090509 esperamos que rusia ponga fin a todas las acciones militares y retire todas las tropas que en los ltimos d as entraron a georgia
4090510 comprendemos que estados unidos asuma como proyecto especial el liderazgo de georgia y comprendemos tambi n que estados unidos est preocupado por el destino de ese proyecto
4090511 no estamos en 1968 en la invasi n de checoslovaquia cuando rusia pod a invadir a un pa s vecino ocupar una capital derrocar a un gobierno y marcharse las cosas han cambiado
4090512 ha llegado el momento de que el presidente ruso haga honor a su palabra
4090513 lo mejor ahora es dejar en manos de los franceses los esfuerzos de mediaci n
4090514 maka sabarlah kamu atas apa yang mereka katakan dan bertasbihlah dengan memuji tuhanmu sebelum terbit matahari dan sebelum terbenamnya dan bertasbih pulalah pada waktu waktu di malam hari dan pada waktu waktu di siang hari supaya kamu merasa senang
4090515 firmada entre el poder ejecutivo y la empresa espa ola para que el estado se haga cargo de la deuda de aerol neas argentinas y austral
4090516 la mejor opci n para la argentina es que el estado se haga cargo de la empresa
4090517 se reinvirti el cien por cien y es totalmente falso que marsans haya vaciado la empresa
4090518 no es verdad que la empresa tenga una deuda de 890 millones de d lares sino que esto es el total del pasivo
4090519 al tiempo que ha recordado las situaciones que atravesaron miles de pasajeros con las demoras y cancelaciones de vuelos de la compa a a rea
4090520 no aceptamos la victimizaci n de la empresa y que le echen la culpa a los empleados

4090522 el vaciamiento se produce realmente con iberia y luego se completa con marsans

4090526 getting this business off the ground was the most frustrating and lonely period of my life
4090527 i had great confidence in the concept and the market potential but i was taken aback by the huge resistance to a new idea i had no support from my friends and in fact most of my old friendships fell apart
4090528 she would help by role playing various sales scenarios with me before my meetings with potential ridespring clients it was extremely helpful
4090529 i began talking about starting my own company right after college my friend andrea was a trusted confidant who recognized my entrepreneurial spirit she really believed in me before i even believed in myself
4090530 clearly you need to have positive thinking people around you at all times
4090531 your cheerleaders give you encouragement youll notice the word courage is in there which is also something very important that a cheerleader helps you develop
4090532 my family was very supportive because they provided me with business know how and showed me how sheer determination could pay off
4090533 they did it not to make a million dollars but because they had four children to feed failure was not an option so i learned from watching them and helping them how to build a business around a strong work ethic
4090534 we talked with friends who were realtors and attorneys because we wanted feedback on our business idea
4090535 we got support and good advice from several experts that we knew personally
4090536 he talked us through a lot of the big picture stuff such as our focus and a way of defining ourselves in the market we were able to bat ideas off of him and he made us think about a lot of areas of business that we had not thought about when we were starting this business four years ago
4090537 good technical help is difficult to find and when you find it you want to hold onto it as if its gold
4090538 i always looked for people with characteristics that i didnt have
4090539 and i had zero computer skills the son in law of a friend of mine was living in my neighborhood when i was starting the business and he had the technical skills that i didnt have he helped by showing me how to do an e mail campaign launch and run an active website and then optimize the site
4090540 es una honor saber que nuestro juego lo disfruta mucha gente con diferentes antecedentes
4090541 desde los jugadores profesionales hasta los entusiastas del f tbol pasando por ni os que solamente quieren jugar en la calle significa que vamos creciendo constantemente
4090542 tambi n hemos a adido una nueva capa de brillo a pes 2009 para lograr un mayor realismo por lo que el juego ha experimentado una mejora est tica radical ahora los estadios tienen entornos m s realistas y nuevos elementos atmosf ricos mientras que en las versiones de playstation 3 y xbox 360 veremos tambi n vallas publicitarias led del mismo modo la manera de mostrar las distancias ha cambiado con el uso de contrastes para a adir profundidad a la acci n en el campo mientras encontramos tambi n un nuevo ngulo de c mara vertical que cambia autom ticamente a una mayor cercan a en las situaciones clave de uno contra uno
4090543 im not willing to say until im on the ground
4090544 i have been greatly encouraged by both of them and now believe that it is time to return home and make any contribution i can to the future of my country
4090545 his absence from the country was an indictment of the government of the day i would just hope he is coming back permanently he is an enormous resource
4090546 i have no political affiliations my obligations are solely to the people of kenya particularly the poor the dispossessed and those in need
4090547 the decision to send the american military even on a humanitarian mission deepened the united states commitment to georgia and americas allies in the former soviet sphere just as russia has been determined to reassert its control in the area
4090548 they should have wiped out the shareholders nationalized the institutions with legislation that they are to be reconstituted with necessary taxpayer support to make them financially viable as five or 10 individual privately held units
4090549 my daughter will soon be 10 months old and after her birth i have not lost a single official match
4090550 i think it was gods reward for all my suffering and hard work
4090551 the whole team and myself has gained confidence every minute we have been together
4090552 the good part of this road is that we have experienced both sides winning and losing that is good going into the quarterfinals where its now or never
4090553 but we are still creating scoring chances and we are looking good in the center of midfield
4090554 even in my dreams i never said i would have a bronze medal
4090555 my happiness is so tremendous at this time this medal it was so unexpected and i probably will not realize the significance of it until later
4090556 i thought it would be necessary for some of the other gymnasts to make errors
4090557 i came to be a part of the final six on vault that was the goal and that was my expectation and i wanted to just have fun in the all around
4090558 after so many injuries and illnesses i was a little tired of gymnastics
4090559 but in these last few years i thought it would be crazy to stop i am older you see but still strong
4090560 i thought i wont be able to get a medal therefore at that moment i didnt think anything except for continuing the competition
4090561 whether my parents are here or not it will not affect my performance
4090562 he is my idol he is very strict with himself during training and he wont give up easily on small details he will try his best to overcome his obstacles
4090563 i was very shocked when i realized i was down i just thought i have to go back and try my best there was a very small chance to medal if i did everything perfect but it wasnt meant to be
4090564 i tried to console him and ask what went wrong
4090565 i came expecting to get some medal so im disappointed
4090566 i made a lot of mistakes on the pommel horse so i understand my score
4090567 we were very disappointed the evening of the match but we started to work as coaches have to do with players
4090568 but we were in the same situation in the algarve cup and we beat germany 2 0 in the third place match so were quite used to the situation i think weve handled it well
4090569 each of the teams in the quarterfinals is of high quality we beat the u s 2 0 and lost 5 1 to japan that shows me how even the teams are
4090570 we played very well against the united states and in the third game we played very badly in the second half
4090571 we have a very young team thats the price you pay for so young a side
4090572 theyre bigger than us and we cant put too much emphasis on things like speed
4090573 that does not make for a complete match the most important thing for us against norway is to make use of our technical ability
4090574 thereve been so many surprises people started to misjudge lifts
4090575 thats weightlifting you start off with what youre going to think will happen but its always different expect the unexpected
4090576 this was going to be the year i won a national championship a gold medal and won a wnba championship i dont think anyone has every done that its still my goal
4090577 id be lying if i told you i played to the best of my ability the past few games
4090578 but we won and ive learned from it this is a learning experience now obviously i have room to improve
4090579 in the past ive played a lot more i think it may have been out of necessity im willing to accept my role and stay sharp and be ready when called upon
4090580 i think she has taken some time to settle in
4090581 i think every first time olympian goes through it no matter who you are or where youve been or what level you perform at when you hear the national anthem before the first game or walk in the opening ceremonies its a different ball game theres nothing to compare it to
4090582 she started to get rolling the game before last she was a little bit out of sync in the first game
4090583 the stage being a little bigger than shes used to is enough to make her take a deep breath and say this is new youd never know shes had any adjustment issues at all as shes been quite the spark for us
4090584 its about tomorrow and getting better each day its not about now
4090585 we were very disappointed the evening of the match but we started to work as coaches have to do with players
4090586 were quite used to the situation i think weve handled it well
4090587 each of the teams in the quarterfinals is of high quality we beat the u s 2 0 and lost 5 1 to japan that shows me how even the teams are
4090588 we played very well against the united states and in the third game we played very badly in the second half
4090589 theyre bigger than us and we cant put too much emphasis on things like speed
4090590 that does not make for a complete match the most important thing for us against norway is to make use of our technical ability
4090591 it was hard to see them and keep an eye on them
4090592 the most unique thing about rip saw ms1 ugv is that its the same technology thats used in nascar or monster trucks its built with a tube chassis which allows us to decrease weight and increase strength
4090593 the motor drives are fiber speed fast as light were talking ethernet speed
4090594 hands down it surpasses most things that are out there right now
4090595 its just zippin up and down hills and over rubble like its not even there
4090596 this is a totally new unique concept for us its gonna change how we operate
4090597 el balance es positivo de todos los lados que se lo analice estamos en contacto con el sector gastronomico y hotelero del lugar y el movimiento de vacaciones de invierno ha sido importante para nuestra ciudad en el caso de los fines de semana hubo que recurrir al alojamiento extra hotelero y el derrame econ mico que genero la carpa para peque as empresas del lugar y para las instituciones intermedias beneficiadas con los eventos ha sido mas que importante
4090598 mas all de lo estrictamente tur stico la carpa genero un espacio de expresi n para poder mostrar distintos sectores de nuestra comunidad como artistas pl sticos artesanos m sicos etc el acompa amiento de la secretar a de turismo de la provincia de buenos aires ha sido importante en todo esto ya que sino a los pueblos peque os del interior nos resultar a muy dif cil afrontar los gastos que implica un evento de estas caracter sticas ya que fueron 15 d as de actividades todas organizadas desde el estado municipal
4090599 this is a question of our honor come out of your homes
4090600 i strongly condemn the human rights violation and the suppression on these oppressed people
4090601 to call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mind set that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past
4090602 this matter of kashmir is not indias internal affair it is as much a matter for pakistan as it is for kashmiris
4090603 oh boy i have work tomorrow lets celebrate get drunk and lay out of work

4090610 we categorically reject the argument that this initiative will create new ground for domestic partnerships in the state of colorado
4090611 its shameful that the opposition would use shallow arguments to protect the culture of corruption in government contracting
4090612 its a well made picture but while its funny in spots its very english i dont think its broadly commercial
4090613 madonna has not made an attempt to adopt this baby earlier this year or now
4090614 its certainly on the table we would certainly be thrilled to make it but were going to wait until the series has finished
4090615 weve just finished the tv film so now we have to wait until november to show it arguably i think its the best thing weve done to date
4090616 for me it was always innate not being overly enthralled with my own reflection it was probably harder for me to watch it than to make it

4090618 gov paterson has decided the primary principle use of the states share of the computer should be economic development purposes today we are officially announcing that all businesses in new york state are eligible to use the computational capacity and services at the supercomputer for their business innovation
4090619 we are at the stage where we are encouraging use and will do anything with our reserve capacity to arrange for time to use the computer
4090620 one of the great things about this talking to some of the potential company users were talking about taking applications that on their own computer systems would take a month to run and having it literally performed in 10 to 15 minutes on the supercomputer the ability to accelerate a companys speed to market and getting answers to questions that took a long time in the lab is huge

4090625 theyre both comfortable with the situation and kelly seems to be quite looking forward to being a single girl again
4090626 were so happy its just the best feeling being with billy i really missed him we realised were at our happiest when we are together
4090627 of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given
4090628 it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye

4090643 the water treatment process can remove bacteria chemicals viruses and other contaminants from water much more effectively than conventional water purification methods
4090644 its major benefits include an easy to use chemical and physical treatment process that cleans water without requiring additional energy and uses recyclable non toxic base materials like the waste product silica and water which bring costs down these features make it a very attractive alternative to desalination which incurs high energy costs
4090645 unisas nano solution to water purification has the potential to prevent disease and poisoning of millions of people

4090676 if i were the computer industry i would be panicked because its not obvious what the solution is going to look like and whether we will get there in time for these new machines
4090677 its a crisis and i wonder whether what we are doing and what is happening within the industry is too little too late
4090678 whoever figures out how to take advantage of multicore first could wreak some serious economic damage on their competition

4090682 beste mevrouw voncken mijn hrm collega mevr j hinskens heeft voo
4090683 all youre doing is protecting more habitat for the barred owl
4090684 mostly reflects the deterioration of our international context which particularly weighed on our exports and which is common to all european countries
4090685 there is a slowdown in the industry and one of the main reason is the rise in oil price
4090686 we have seen this in our own company our orders have slowed down
4090687 although inflation has been stable at 4 0 in july it is still way above target
4090688 hence the possibility that the european central bank is cutting interest rates in 2008 to support the sickening economy is remote
4090689 remember a stingy planter gets a stingy crop a lavish planter gets a lavish crop i want each of you to take plenty of time to think it over and make up your own mind what you will give that will protect you against sob stories and arm twisting god loves it when the giver delights in the giving
4090690 a stingy planter gets a stingy crop a lavish planter gets a lavish crop
4090691 a generous man will prosper he who refreshes others will himself be refreshed
4090692 tell those rich in this worlds wealth to quit being so full of themselves and so obsessed with money which is here today and gone tomorrow tell them to go after god who piles on all the riches we could ever manage to do good to be rich in helping others to be extravagantly generous if they do that theyll build a treasury that will last gaining life that is truly life

4090696 i didnt do what i wanted to i couldnt use any of my techniques i have nothing left
4090697 if i step onto the tatami again i may probably be thrown again im really empty now
4090698 ill go home amd closely look back at myself and what i have been doing thats what i would do first
4090699 if i feel like doing it again i may start with running or something like that but for now i am empty
4090700 i could see he was trying to tackle me on the inside from the very beginning and i intended to stop him from tackling me
4090701 having said that i think its fool who is thrown down again
4090702 its the first bright news for traders in the oil market in a while
4090703 the dramatic drop off in commodities and specifically oil has been well overdone in my view
4090704 they still think the u s is the epicenter of the world economy
4090705 the u s is still very important but as far as commodity demand is concerned the u s isnt the main game in town china is the biggest consumer and increasingly india
4090706 since then the greenback has improved by 6 9 per cent
4090707 we are very excited to be moving into our new home in san jose the customer response to our material has been exceptional and with the key markets we address being very large it is time to bring our larger scale manufacturing online while we will continue to house some of our development at our partner sanmina sci who helped us incubate the technology it is important we make the next step and put in large scale manufacturing for our materials to insure our customers adequate supply as we grow
4090708 no civilization can survive the physical destruction of its resource base
4090709 the second law of thermodynamics trumps the laws of economics
4090710 if the world was made of oil there would still be a finite supply of it
4090711 if kindness and comfort are as i suspect the results of an energy surplus then as the supply contracts we could be expected to start fighting once again like cats in a sack
4090712 one of our central tasks is the creation of the post oil megacity
4090713 the three school superintendents are pleased with the change it is a needed service and the only way we could serve every parenting student was if we took ownership of it

4090720 shes been with the boxing club for about a year and ive seen her grow and develop she was shy but now shes come out of her shell shes a blessing and she helps out with the younger kids in the gym a lot shes had a hard life and i would like something good to come her way
4090721 ive seen videos from when i was little so ive been singing my whole life
4090722 the kids are drawn to excitement and we want to harness that
4090723 we can draw them in with the excitement and hopefully they will learn something this is a good hook
4090724 our curriculum is going to be the armor of god and were in a battle field now so we thought that the military theme fit
4090725 our youth ministry is thriving but the childrens ministry was lacking we wanted to take the same concepts we were using for the youth ministry and adapt it to the younger kids
4090726 when they came up with the boot camp idea i thought it would be a great idea to do the fly by
4090727 i liked the obstacle course because you got to go through everything and run through the tires and find a ball
4090728 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
4090729 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
4090730 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
4090731 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
4090732 so many people are being hurt by these high gas prices and it just caught america by surprise they just werent ready for these adjustments that need to be made
4090733 to make a woman march with the flag of the islamic republic in beijing is pure heresy and shows total disobedience of the laws mandated by our spiritual guides

4090742 we did not write a check there was no cash collected
4090743 baird gave us two names of soldiers and their addresses so we could send them care packages
4090744 citizens for patriots is all about supporting our troops we are not about buying t shirts and handing out plaques and showboating our organization
4090745 in the past all money that has been donated through our community has went straight to sending packages to our soldiers and that is what we want to continue
4090746 were in charge of the funds and were going to take care of them for him
4090747 the seniors are very proud of whats going on down there
4090748 that money represents about 50 percent of what we have going on weve been able to increase congregate and home delivered meals and coordinated transportation
4090749 a large number of seniors wont be served and i dont know about you but i dont want to sit in my chair down there and decide who wont be
4090750 i dont think theres anyone in this room and hopefully in the community that doesnt realize the value of the senior center down there
4090751 the difficult decision for us here was selecting a time when there were less issues on the ballot

4090780 we look forward to another successful year of joint development with the entry into this new agreement
4090781 we believe that the use of carbon nanotubes in next generation displays is a natural application of this material and we are pleased to be developing these potentially groundbreaking technologies with samsung electronics a world leader in display technologies
4090782 we have made significant progress in the first year of our joint development agreement the results of the collaboration have exceeded our expectations and have been accomplished ahead of schedule
4090783 in this second year we are looking to build upon these first year accomplishments and extend the capabilities for carbon nanotubes as transparent conductors even further in various display applications
4090784 nanotechnology is a great example it has the potential to advance medicine agriculture health and environmental science and provide great benefits to society but there may be safety concerns related to the special properties of nanoparticles such as their greater abilities to penetrate and move across organs and cells in biological systems
4090785 the u s oversight system currently relies on agencies and regulations designed for related technologies but they are not equipped to adequately handle the novel properties and unique challenges associated with nanotechnology in fact oversight issues associated with applications for agriculture and food remain largely unexplored
4090786 to meet the needs and values of all stakeholders involved we must consider new technologies from a variety of perspectives for example some stakeholders are more concerned about the economic benefits of new technology while others care primarily about the health and environmental impact
4090787 our goal was to develop a multidisciplinary approach to more comprehensively evaluate oversight systems for emerging technologies
4090788 we anticipate that this new approach will be a valuable tool for analyzing multiple perspectives features outcomes and tradeoffs of oversight systems
4090789 such an approach that incorporates the viewpoints of key disciplines and the perspectives of multiple stakeholders could help to ameliorate controversy and conflict as new technologies emerge and oversight systems for them are considered and deployed
4090790 mechanical engineers can be at the forefront of developing new technology for environmental remediation farming and food production housing transportation safety security healthcare and water resources
4090791 mechanical engineers to tap into the collective wisdom of an organization or network of stakeholders
4090792 nano bio will provide the building blocks that future engineers will use to solve pressing problems in diverse fields including medicine energy water management aeronautics agriculture and environmental management
4090793 engineers will be able to act as independent operators interacting with colleagues around the world
4090794 engineers can design at home with advanced cad systems or in collaboration with their global colleagues in virtual worlds they will be able to use home based fabrication technology to test many of their designs
4090795 as mechanical engineering looks to 2028 leaders will value people with diverse expertise and experience they will bring this global profession together to keep the promise of technology serving people they will inspire men and women everywhere to believe that grand challenges are a rally cry for a profession that is ready for the adventure of making the difficult doable
4090796 as we have stated in the past we are focused upon reaching profitability this transaction along with other organizational adjustments which have been recently made reduces our net cash expenses by approximately 500 000 per year or approximately 20 as a management team we have been investigating for some time options to reduce our expense level in order to minimize the amount of required external funding and accelerate our ability to achieve profitability from operations in that light we felt it appropriate to focus on our revenue generating instrumentation related products and technologies realizing meaningful cost savings via this transaction with aspera as an alternative to curtailing some or all research and development activities on the scientific applications in order to achieve the cost savings was a much better alternative for our shareholders additionally as the granted licenses are non exclusive we retain the ability to partner with others in these areas or to further develop the technologies ourselves
4090797 in addition to the financial benefits of this transaction we are now poised to devote 100 of our efforts towards exploiting the opportunity for our instruments to be key enablers of breakthrough projects occurring in the areas of stem cell research neural regeneration and biosensing and the increased use of live cell assays for drug discovery and development from an operational perspective the bioforce organization is squarely focused upon exploiting the market opportunities for our nano enabler and cyto enabler molecular printing systems and other instrumentation oriented products and services this is important as we look to expand our presence in the academic research community as well as initiate sales to the commercial sector
4090798 jhg has a tremendous understanding of new technologies and a passion for sport
4090799 we are excited to be working with jhg on this project the people there have a tremendous understanding of new technologies and a passion for the sport together we believe they can help us achieve our mission of reinstating softball on the olympic program for 2016
4090800 despite the current global momentum and excitement of the beijing 2008 olympics many softball fans around the world are disappointed that this may be softballs last appearance in the summer olympics
4090801 however our partnership with the international softball federation will help the organization create and utilize an effective social media strategy to show the ioc and the world that softball is an immensely popular and expanding sport that has global appeal and deserves to have a place in the 2016 olympic games

4090804 when i was in university i heard the story of the monk who was in prison for 33 years and survived torture and atrocities
4090805 his story stayed with me for such a long time
4090806 what moved me first was the tibetan peoples determination how they carry themselves how proud they are of their country and culture
4090807 usually i like to watch the olympics but i wont watch these
4090808 it really has reached the point where there is a big contradiction between sentiment in the exile community and the policies and actions of the dalai lama
4090809 the ability to venerate the dalai lama but not to accept his policies thats been there for a long time
4090810 but whether its 1 000 2 000 3 000 i dont think anybody has first of all adequate information to begin to put a shape on that
4090811 and the jailers the entire security establishment are very angry at the protesters

4090855 we loved the near native performance of windows guests in hyper v
4090856 the most notable and the most significant change between the initial release candidate version rc0 of hyper v and the rtm edition is better performance most of the performance work was done between rc0 and rc1 but not many people knew about it due to a not so wide a release and b a ban on performance testing by ms

4090913 to get a competitive edge you must have quality in your manufacturing processes
4090914 our customers come from as varied industries as automotive to medical devices and each has a different competitive driver some are looking to drive all possible costs out while others are more focused on their ability to replicate sound processes for each we still must set high quality standards
4090915 moll industries is not alone in its need for a quality platform that identifies defects before they are manufactured and links those defects back to design in order to continuously improve quality
4090916 other solutions on the market are not rooted in manufacturing quality the way we are we have 15 years of experience working with fortune 500 manufacturers helping them solve their unique business problems

4090937 i could not run the affairs of the adhoc committee because of some personal reasons so for the best interest of the game i have decided to give my resignation
4090938 the rest of the games are determined during the season but we do know were going to do at least one more penn state game and possibly two
4090939 the two main issues were the level of service and price
4090940 we were able to reach resolution on both we never offered 1 10 per subscriber to comcast that was a number that somehow got out and spread it was never a part of any proposal on our part
4090941 im not surprised that we werent fully distributed at the outset its kind of the way the cable business works but we got the comcast deal done in time for this season and were happy about that
4090942 typically a sports tier is available in about 5 percent of a cable systems homes
4090943 there are programs no cost and low cost in central ohio that provide these services for people who cant transport the animal to the shelter
4090944 i find that the way to get ahead around here is to be friendly with the right people both inside and outside the firm they get tired of always talking shop so i find a common interest with some its sports with others its our kids and interact with them on that level the other formal stuff around the office is important but i really work at this informal side and have found it pays off when promotion time rolls around
4090945 i dont know how our countries got so separated but id like to see some of these kids come and play in america and see how we live
4090946 this trip is about connecting and friendship this is simply about baseball and kids getting to know each other

4090953 even as more details are awaited prima facie all the concerns of the defence forces appear to have been suitably addressed the increase in military service pay of pbors personnel below officer rank and compensation for middle rung officers is particularly heartening

4090958 this has been a long time in development and i think were at a point where we need to move forward with it
4090959 there was a pretty serious slowdown in 84 and 85 then things got better
4090960 florida has always come back its just a question of how soon
4090961 it appears that the gas prices havent really slowed down tourism in northwest florida and i think part of the reason is that people are going to take their vacations
4090962 we are a very close beach for our primary markets in tennessee georgia and alabama if people have changed their plans maybe they havent gone as far into florida as they would have
4090963 in northwest florida 95 percent of tourists are drive in visitors whereas places like miami its probably more than 80 percent fly in visitors
4090964 orlando is about 50 percent drive in 50 percent fly in
4090965 everybody comes down and theyve gotta spend so much money on staying somewhere and eating out
4090966 of course fishings not really what they gotta have and if they want to do four to six hour trips thats the way they want to go instead of spending all day out there
4090967 the gas prices are going up and the economy and the red snapper limits theyre saying it aint worth it
4090968 even though theyve been coming down here 15 20 years and have a good time they just dont see spending that much money fishing but you really cant blame them its still fun but its not what you gotta have
4090969 in deciding who we should partner with on the restaurants at thewit we carefully considered restaurant operating companies across the country in order to find an extraordinary organization that could truly add to excitement of our world class dining market here in chicago it is for that reason we are now thrilled to be working with bob amick and entire concentrics team they are certainly one of the few organizations in america that have the creativity and ability to meet and exceed these expectations
4090970 we are excited to partner with thewit concentrics has brought extraordinary unique restaurants great food and outstanding service to the dining scene in the south since 2002 and we are excited to make our debut in chicago the three restaurants will be gathering places for both hotel guests and chicago dwellers who crave chef inspired food in a vibrant environment

4090973 archetypes are psychological structures reflected in symbols images and themes common to all culture and all times you see them in recurring images in art literature myths and dreams you may experience archetypes directly as different parts of you if you say on one hand that you want one thing and on the other you want something else you can give archetypal names to those parts as they generally communicate desires and motivations common to humans everywhere although the potential characters within us are universal each of us expresses them differently endowing them with somewhat different styles traits and mannerisms for example while the warrior is an archetype different kinds of warriors engage in different battles the warrior archetype ecompasses the japanese samurai and the american g i but it also might include the hiv researcher the advocate for social justice or the member of a street gang each of them are all warriors the expression of an archetype will be influenced by a persons culture setting and time in history but it also will be a manifestation of his or her individuality as aspects of ourselves archetypes may reveal our most important desires and goals understanding their expression in our life myths or stories help us gain access to unrealized potential grasp the logic and importance of our lives and increase our empathy for the stories that others live
4090974 as an oem your time to market is everything get your complete product out there first and you have a distinct competitive advantage
4090975 but thats hard to do when you have a complex project and deadlines are looming this white paper will teach you how to complete projects faster and cheaper by working with the alarm monitoring experts
4090976 remember you cant afford to buy 1000 units at a time and theres also no room in your budget for features you just dont need
4090977 your vendor had better have top quality engineers that can handle your tight deadlines and meet every spec right down to the last detail
4090978 and what do you do when your client adds a new monitoring requirement at the very last minute if youre smart you call dps
4090979 oem work including custom engineering is something that we specialize in and weve got it down to a science
4090980 two things are especially important for our oem clients first development must be very fast to keep them on schedule second our product has to work well in their environment the way we promised it would
4090981 some of our oem clients require special design modifications and you can only do that if you do the engineering and manufacturing yourself dps will also meet your standards for boxing and labeling just like it came from your shipping dock
4090982 this is an exciting time for our guests and our organization to experience growth for our brand with the opening of another new lubys restaurant
4090983 these new restaurants offer an upscale dining experience while still delivering lubys traditional quality offerings with an abundance of healthy choices all at a great value to our customers
4090984 this is a great new community for lubys in the northwest suburban area of houston our enthusiastic crew looks forward to serving guests fresh quality food in a beautiful new building with a warm and comfortable atmosphere

4090990 t he governor shall not take action upon any charges made to the governor against a city officer until the charges have been exhibited to the governor in writing verified by the affidavit of the party making them that he or she believes the charges to be true and an opportunity given the officer of being heard in his or her defense
4090991 the governor needs to remember that the governors not the governor and the governor is the governor and not the judiciary uh if its not constitutional thats something that the judges should decide the governor should decide if its good policy or not and should make a decision
4090992 ive truly relished working with my longtime partner tom cruise to revitalize united artists and i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years reinvigorating the brand and developing such a strong slate of films
4090993 as much as ive enjoyed my time as an executive i have longed to return to my true love which is making movies so thats what ive decided to do
4090994 i still believe in our vision for ua and i am confident that mgm ceo harry sloan and our colleagues at mgm will see that vision through to reality
4090995 when she put them on myself and my daughter thought oh my goodness it is inappropriate because it is sexually suggestive
4090996 you just never know who could see that and think it was a bit too enticing for a young child to be wearing
4090997 this is part of a worrying trend of inappropriate clothing marketed at young children
4090998 the design was approved by disney it was completely innocent and not meant to cause offence
4090999 this basic intervention implementing a household smoking ban has the potential to promote antismoking norms and to prevent adolescent smoking
4091000 adolescents are faced with so many influences that contribute to smoking attitudes and behaviors to find that a simple household rule that bans smoking in the home has a meaningful impact on smoking attitudes and behaviors is somewhat surprising
4091001 this study provides evidence that even in a smoke free home environment parental behavior remains a strong influence on teen smoking attitudes and behavior
4091002 these bans send a strong message to teens that its not okay to smoke and in the face of so many other external factors that may influence teens to smoke peers advertising a home smoking policy is one thing that parents can control to some extent
4091003 thankfully my wife is over 1 000 miles away so ill answer this

4091007 i always try to talk my way out of kissing scenes do they really need to kiss in this part
4091008 ricardo chavira hates kissing me we are both not really fond of the kissing scenes
4091009 they stayed hot for about 15 minutes after they were lit but i was in my own world and walked straight into one and singed my forehead
4091010 i was bringing my knees up to kick a russian spy in his chest as one does and my shins went straight into the metal bar
4091011 everybody was very accommodating and i had a very nice plastic surgeon who gave me straight scars that are healing nicely
4091012 i had a lot of bruises and i got burned but it was just my own clumsiness
4091013 its the most disgusting scene ive been involved in as far as human waste and filth is concerned
4091014 there were so many insects it looked like walls were moving
4091015 every cell in your body tells you not to do it but you do because its so thrilling
4091016 in music lots of people turn to drugs but thats so unoriginal
4091017 as was anticipated from cuis first quarter results we are even more encouraged by these record setting second quarter numbers
4091018 while we still show a 17 666 operational loss for the three month period ended june 30 2008 much of that loss was due to one time acquisition charges
4091019 these results also demonstrate our continued focus on operational efficiencies delivering shareholder value and superior customer service while organically growing our business
4091020 we believe that the final commercialization of the waycool cpu solution coupled with the design wins and our focus on increasing net to sale profits all support the potential for strong growth for the remainder of the year
4091021 this trend could prove to be an opportunity for smaller and targeted specialty pharmaceutical and biotech companies to gain ground on larger competitors in physician reach and market share through cost effective digital sales and marketing support strategies
4091022 digital channels have leveled the playing field in many industries giving sales and marketing groups the chance to make a big impact even with limited yet targeted resources
4091023 we are particularly pleased to have someone of grahams caliber and clear race winning potential at nextcruise tm
4091024 he is an ideal representative of a race series that is showing that race competition and environmental responsibility can go hand in hand
4091025 the second quarter of 2008 was a pivotal quarter for general steel
4091026 as witnessed by our recent acquisition of maoming we remain steadfast in executing our strategy of growing through aggressive mergers joint ventures and acquisitions targeting state owned enterprise steel companies and selected entities with outstanding potential
4091027 we are pleased to be building at our longmen joint venture two new 1280 cubic meter blast furnaces upon completion we anticipate this will double our pig iron capacity and allow us to increase crude steel production capacity from 2 5 to 4 0 million tons annually the added output and production efficiencies will better allow us to exploit the strong demand and our unique advantages in the xian and shaanxi markets
4091028 since our acquisition in 2007 by eqt scandic has placed a heavy focus on making profitable growth the number one priority there is a great deal of energy within scandic that is ready to drive our new growth given our history with micros and its products we are confident our continued and expanded partnership will help us achieve these goals
4091029 after evaluation of numerous products and suppliers we concluded that micros and its opera enterprise solution were the best fit for our corporate requirements we value micross vast experience in the hospitality industry
4091030 we have enjoyed a strong partnership with scandic over the years and we are honored to have that partnership grow scandic is a very strong brand and we look forward to supporting its expansion
4091031 punch and judy went through the doldrums a few years ago and you dont see so many shows on beaches and street corners
4091032 we get a lot of negative publicity you have got to get permission from the council but some councils dont want shows it is just political correctness
4091033 but it is making a comeback up until this year people have always gone abroad for their holidays but now there is a big increase in staying in this country
4091034 perceptions of which foods should be eaten in moderation and an understanding of balancing a diet appear to be weak
4091035 we know that families in some communities still use the corner shop on a daily basis for their food and household goods
4091036 it is therefore essential that we take healthy eating options to these stores and reach those families who are at the greatest risk of poor health due to a poor diet
4091037 its important that people have the opportunity to buy fresh fruit and vegetables where it is convenient for them
4091038 he made me turn all the way around while he stared me up and down the only thing he said was that other people didnt like the way i looked so he wanted me to leave

4091044 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife rosetta getty for months can cause such a scandal its awful i cant tell you you wonder when its all going to stop

4091052 the filmmakers have every right to do what they think is best in support of their movies but we have the right to do whats best for warner bros sometimes the pursuit of those interests results in a disagreement
4091053 for now were preparing to release the film in october but i dont see it starting out on 800 screens if joel is thinking there is someone out there willing to spend twice as much money as were willing to im sure he will pursue that
4091054 theres only two guys in the conversation tiger woods and michael phelps
4091055 id go with tiger but if you picked phelps id have a hard time disagreeing
4091056 i didnt know about him before the olympics but i definitely know about him now eleven gold medals is fantastic
4091057 you can make a very strong case that if you were to draw up a list of 10 greatest male athletes of all time he has to be on that list and maybe in the top three
4091058 how dare anyone out there make fun of obama after all hes been through hes a human
4091059 the common thread of democratic history from thomas jefferson to bill clinton has been an abiding faith in the judgment of hardworking american families and a commitment to helping the excluded the disenfranchised and the poor strengthen our nation by earning themselves a piece of the american dream we remember that this great land was sculpted by immigrants and slaves their children and grandchildren

4091111 tom indicated he would be back in time to join the main party on its scheduled return to the uk on saturday morning

4091130 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity
4091131 as the commission finds are necessary to diminish eliminate or prevent such burden
4091132 its my appeal that we should adopt a reconciliatory approach so that stability should return
4091133 because if there is stability we can fight terrorism if we have a strong economy we can fight terrorism and we should all put aside our differences and work to make pakistan strong
4091134 pakistan is passing through a difficult phase we have to fight back the challenges of terrorism and extremism
4091135 the war against terrorism and extremism is the war of our own survival with the peoples co operation we will fight this war and ensure the governments writ at all costs
4091136 while there are celebrations song and dance is happening violence continues in the tribal areas and the government despite the musharraf issue is under pressure to control and ultimately end the violence
4091137 the army which was his real power base cannot support him anymore because he has become a liability

4091142 kami mencermati tujuh parpol kami temukan soal keterwakilan perempuan 30 persen ini menunjukan hal yang positif tapi banyak yang perlu dicermati
4091143 artinya kami melihat masalah keterwakilan perempuan 30 persen dalam pencalegan masih dalam tataran retorika dam pencitraan parpol kami melihat mereka belum sungguh sungguh soal ini kami prihatin dengan kebijakan parpol itu
4091144 kita melihat ada dualisme dari para pimpinan parpol soal ini namun sebenarnya ada nilai positif dan keterwakilan perempuan sudah layak dibandingkan pada pemilu 2004 lalu
4091145 kpu dan kpud harus bersikap tegas agar parpol memenuhi amanat uu tersebut dan tidak gentar dengan parpol yang tidak melaksanakan itu

4091148 solar panel cleaning is extremely important to achieve maximum output of a solar electric system
4091149 the financial impact of a clean solar panel is immediate more electricity produced by the solar panels means less dollars billed by the utility company and a direct savings to the owner during this time of year when solar systems generate the most power due to air conditioning usage cleaning maintenance is especially important
4091150 last year i installed solar panels to fuel my electricity
4091151 in light of the wild fires raging throughout the state i grew concerned about how i would be able to properly maintain my solar panels with all the ash and soot left behind after using powerboost my concern is gone its very easy to apply and works instantly in even the harshest environmental conditions i am confident in the effectiveness of powerboost and highly recommend this product

4091158 because the issues you raise would require the committee to investigate the conduct of members the precedents of the committee indicate that the committee on standards of official conduct would be the appropriate venue for the issues you have raised
4091159 the precedent set by the jack abramoff investigation actually supports the committee conducting a probe of countrywide vip programs pertaining to the conduct of franklin raines james johnson and others at fannie mae freddie mac and administration officials
4091160 the allegations of illegal gift giving swirling around the country vip program are broad and serious
4091161 in a congress that was supposed to emphasize ethics its disappointing that no committee chairman seems to want to claim jurisdiction and investigate the nexus between the mortgage crisis and public officials who got too cozy with lenders
4091162 since the allegations surrounding the friends of angelo list first surfaced ive been urging an investigation
4091163 also introduced the financial disclosure and integrity act to urge transparency and ethics reform in this area

4091168 over the years traditional indian garments have all but disappeared from our fashion shows more importantly the craftsmanship that indian artisans are so well known for seems to have taken a back stage we need to revive this
4091169 weve noticed that if designers showcase indian garments at fashion weeks they are criticized because of the impression that such events are meant to display only pr t collections
4091170 there is also the feeling that buyers who attend fashion shows are essentially looking at foreign markets and thus would not react to indian designs

4091249 ryan do you think if maybe you like lifted some weights and developed a stronger arm and some power youd be considered a better player
4091250 the fact that the biggest number of bombs fell on purely economic and civilian targets clearly indicated that was a premeditated thing and it had nothing to do only with abkhazia or south ossetia
4091251 the new alliance between our parties is to pull the country out of the four month long political deadlock
4091252 this has also given us the hope that we can take the peace process to a logical conclusion and draft a constitution within the given time
4091253 we hope other parties will also join us to give the block a two thirds majority to form the government
4091254 it appears that the maoists dont want us in the government and that is why the nepali congress is putting forward its own candidate
4091255 we will seek the support of other parties and are hopeful that we will win

4091269 these songs have been forged by the flames of centuries of war and oppression baptized by the free flowing blood of our ancestors blessed by the tears of our saints who pray constantly for their burning motherland and raised like a phoenix from the ashes by a nation that passionately seeks to preserve its voice
4091270 our main finding was that reward dependence is the only personality dimension correlated with opiate receptor binding and that positive correlation was restricted to the ventral striatum which is considered the key area of the human reward system and of the development of addictive behavior
4091271 this correlation means that people with high reward dependence have a high concentration of opiate receptors available in that area while people with low dependence have fewer opiate receptors
4091272 this is a novel finding and will provide a deeper understanding of the functional relation between human personality neurobiology and addictive behavior
4091273 understanding the central role of neurotransmission processes in certain brain structures for the expression of psychologically defined constructs such as personality will make a great difference in the future of medicine
4091274 is that it shows that pet technology is capable of detecting subtle biochemical differences in the brain in healthy persons which may ultimately be responsible for what we consider the individual personality this has far reaching implications not only for choosing the best individual treatments but also in discussions of an individuals free will

4091302 we completed this acquisition because were beginning to get some significant business on the back of the ibm and dell relationship
4091303 theres a bit of detail to be worked out in terms of what of the existing pingtel business models we will continue to support
4091304 the open source software based approach is very easy to deploy manage and integrate and is something proven to work in the smb space
4091305 it seems that nortel understands the market demands for more open source less proprietary systems
4091306 my thought was microsoft and nortel would be building this stuff together
4091307 its the kind of mosquito that bites birds not people
4091308 they wont tell us the exact location because they dont want people to go out there and interfere with their traps
4091309 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4091310 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4091311 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4091312 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
4091313 i understand they have put puryear in the controversial category
4091314 its very rare for a district court nominee to become controversial usually they just fly through
4091315 groups can attack a nominee but youll never see the nominee respond to anything except at hearings
4091316 as far as his qualifications go he was at the top of his class in law school he clerked on the u s court of appeals he has legislative experience in the u s senate he manages litigation for a big fortune 500 company and the aba american bar association rated him as qualified
4091317 gus realizes this is a lame duck year in politics
4091318 its true for all nominees whether youre in the deal or not is beyond your control
4091319 at the end of the session its who wants a bridge in vermont
4091320 im glad the judiciary committee is taking a closer look at mr puryear as a candidate because the issues we raised are legitimate issues
4091321 i understand they have put puryear in the controversial category
4091322 its very rare for a district court nominee to become controversial usually they just fly through

4091329 it was just baseball card money for me at the time
4091330 your spouse would have to participate but it is more lucrative are you interested
4091331 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
4091332 saakashvili was crazy enough to go in the middle of the night and bomb a city
4091333 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran over elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilians alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
4091334 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4091335 they introduced themselves and at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times
4091336 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
4091337 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him
4091338 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4091339 bill gwatney was our friend our partys leader and so many times our partys conscience
4091340 our state and our party are better for all that bill gwatney has done
4091341 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
4091342 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4091343 aprovechar el encuentro para preguntarnos qu nos debemos los misioneros en el tema de salud y cu les son las responsabilidades compartidas que tenemos en mejorar nuestros indicadores se han realizado importantes inversiones en infraestructura hospitalaria nueva en la modernizaci n de las existentes y se ha reorganizado la estructura del financiamiento como lo demuestra la creaci n y puesta en marcha del seguro provincial de salud con recursos propios que es la nica cobertura existente bajo forma de seguro en la rep blica argentina
4091344 eso es lo que los misioneros podemos mostrar en el escenario nacional y latinoamericano se ha construido un modelo sanitario que estamos en condiciones de exhibir
4091345 nos hicieron creer que cada uno de nosotros es una media naranja y que la vida s lo tiene sentido cu ndo encontramos la otra mitad no nos contaron que ya nacemos enteros que nadie en nuestra vida merece cargar en las espaldas la responsabilidad de completar lo que nos falta
4091346 toda la metodolog a oriental puede ser reducida a una palabra atestiguar
4091347 hey dude i would like to write something about that i am thinking to use the following structure any advice
4091348 so often that at the end someone want to write something about it in order to not keep repeating himself
4091349 working on an immediate patch for customers in production vmware expects to fix the issue in code in the next 36 hours once qa testing has been completed
4091350 this certainly appears to be the most publicized bug for vmware so far and i think it is damaging to vmware and virtualization as a whole the hypervisor is the lowest software level on the server and if you have an issue like this boom all your infrastructure is down
4091351 software will always have bugs but a widespread issue like this that affects all vms is really damaging especially at this point in time where virtualization is starting to take off vmware is going to have to fix this fast provide an explanation and outline what they will do to strengthen their qa in the future
4091352 weve just encountered a serious bug with our esx cluster serious enough that i thought i should post about it here as a prior warning for others running esx 3 5 update 2
4091353 all the players are under a lot of pressure to rush things out the door
4091354 you want to make sure you can trust that product
4091355 as enterprises move towards a fully virtualized infrastructure issues like this certainly will make people think about adopting multiple hypervisors and not putting all your eggs in one basket
4091356 if you are 100 per cent virtualized using a single vendor one software bug or an exploitable security flaw in the hypervisor could instantly freeze your entire infrastructure these are the risks you take if you have a monoculture weve seen it before with things like windows ie etc
4091357 we were proactively notified by vmware monday they told us these are the symptoms and what would happen if you powered down your virtual machines
4091358 they gave us the general prescription in terms of troubleshooting and things to avoid such as powering down
4091359 the engine design is expected to significantly increase fuel efficiency for sustainable bio alcohol fuels
4091360 unified communications is more of a strategy than a product
4091361 they dont have five or six people they can send out for training
4091362 if you dont have that cohesive experience it doesnt sound like unified communications
4091363 microsoft brought unified communications back into the spotlight a couple years ago and they are one of the strong leaders in the market
4091364 looks like its becoming the no 1 standard for unified communications
4091365 it lends a little bit toward the pbx philosophy wed rather do one thing really well than spread ourselves thin
4091366 safety is a big part of what i do for a living and eliminating any
4091367 its the kind of mosquito that bites birds not people
4091368 they wont tell us the exact location because they dont want people to go out there and interfere with their traps
4091369 for most people they might experience flu like symptoms with west nile but except for perhaps the elderly or infants it is not anything like triple e
4091370 fortunately there have been no cases of triple e reported in massachusetts this year it goes on a seven year cycle and i think we are in a down year after all the activity we had
4091371 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4091372 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4091373 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4091374 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4091375 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4091376 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4091377 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4091378 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4091379 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4091380 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4091381 providing programs like this to the public is part of the kenw mission
4091382 the program will give eastern new mexico citizens a chance to learn more about their congressional candidates
4091383 we have held forums before but in the past we sponsored them
4091384 the municipal league is sponsoring this forum kenw tv is just broadcasting it
4091385 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4091386 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4091387 by not being able to start a conversation where people remember you
4091388 these events wouldnt be much fun if they were just policy
4091389 the next state legislative session will be a 60 day session which is why the regulations are so thick
4091390 i value the networking you talk to these people on the phone a lot but you value putting a name with a face
4091391 the community college has been wonderful the people at the civic center have been wonderful
4091392 weve been having a great time in clovis everybody has bent over backwards
4091393 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4091394 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4091395 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4091396 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4091397 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4091398 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4091399 umbral de un verdadero golpe de estado contra el orden constitucional
4091400 al t pico estilo de las dictaduras que precedieron a la recuperaci n de la democracia en 1982
4091401 toman aeropuertos toman cortes departamentales electorales y balean carros coches de ministros
4091402 las fuerzas armadas son los garantes de la democracia concepto que incluye el precepto constitucional de garantizar la estabilidad del gobierno legalmente constituido sea el actual o cualquier otro que recoja la voluntad del pueblo que es el gran soberano
4091403 los resultados del proceso cualquiera que estos fueran con la mayor cordura y sentido de responsabilidad
4091404 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
4091405 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades
4091406 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender

4091411 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
4091412 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
4091413 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
4091414 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
4091415 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e

4091429 ha sido la mayor preocupaci n de elena varela y de los organismos de derechos humanos en la medida que da cuenta de la situaci n y violaci n de derechos del pueblo mapuche ella ha filmado a alguno de esos pueblos incluso nosotros la hemos acompa ado
4091430 es imprescindible un pronunciamiento formal y p blico de parte del gobierno de chile que incluya la defensa integral del trabajo period stico y documental
4091431 el fiscal de la forestal mininco ha estado amedrentando a las comunidades mapuche de chequenco y antinao oblig ndoles a declarar en contra de nosotros que actualmente nos encontramos recluidos en la c rcel de temuco y de angol a muchos mapuche de la comunidad se les est ofreciendo dinero y artefactos como celulares para que declaren y esp en a su propia gente
4091432 emplazamos p blicamente a ambos consejeros a que si tienen algo que decir comentar o discutir las puertas de la comunidad siempre han estado abiertas al di logo y por lo tanto les invitamos p blicamente a visitarnos adem s necesitamos que cambien su actitud servil a los intereses del estado chileno y que le hacen un flaco favor a la lucha de nuestro pueblo mapuche
4091433 el objetivo de la cumbre de mujeres es encontrarnos para intercambiar los an lisis de las realidades de nuestros pa ses y a partir de ah hacer incidencia en todos los espacios y tambi n trabajar para que las mujeres ejerzan sus derechos con la m s amplia participaci n

4091438 in til buscar un programa de recuperaci n que sea consistente con el pago de la deuda fijada por nuestros acreedores
4091439 nuestros peque os productores agr colas son masacrados por la brutal injusticia del entorno del comercio internacional
4091440 en la globalizaci n el campesino o campesina pierde su identidad social cultural y econ mica de productor ahora un campesino es consumidor de semillas y qu micos caros que venden las poderosas corporaciones trasnacionales por medio de poderosos latifundistas y prestamistas locales
4091441 a menudo lo han hecho en unos t rminos muy desfavorables para los granjeros pobres dejando a estos con m s inseguridad alimentaria y a los gobiernos a depender de unas ayudas internacionales poco predecibles
4091442 muchas de las empresas privadas que vinieron a reemplazar a los investigadores estatales resultaron ser monopolistas en busca de dinero
4091443 no pensamos que el coste humano de esos programas seria tan grande y que las ganancias econ micas tardasen tanto en llegar
4091444 el sector paraestatal continuar a siendo un riesgo para la exitosa implementaci n del presupuesto de 2002 03 las intervenciones del gobierno en la agricultura y otros mercados alimentarios est n socavando otras inversiones m s productivas
4091445 a ver el lugar de reposo de mat as catrileo el fue mi hermano mi amigo que me acompa en los d as de prisi n fui a rendirle homenaje
4091446 porque yo no ten a factura para comprobar que los 180 000 que se robaron eran m os
4091447 yo siento mucho sufrimiento estos a os que el hijo est preso son un dolor muy grande la comida no la puedo aprovechar la como entre l grimas a ra z de este problema de los que llevan la justicia me he enfermado tuvieron que llevarme al hospital espero que dejen en libertad a mi hijo y me lo entreguen en buenas condiciones como estaba l al ser detenido
4091448 we conduct cbi background checks on all coaches all head coaches and assistant coaches are required to sign a form stipulating that they have no convictions for any offense of a sexual nature or any offense of any kind involving children
4091449 well be following up with the teams and coaches from bennett to determine what involvement mr hoff may have with a team
4091450 ive never been asked by anyone in elizabeth who our coaches are
4091451 youre responsible for those kids for a head coach to know this and allow this it just blew me away
4091452 if i knew about it theres no way oh heck no
4091453 we felt that we were policing our team within our team
4091454 we would never allow someone with his background on our staff
4091455 my sin is not homosexuality but i have struggled with pornography and had a period in my life where i struggled with exaggeration and honesty in the name of status and comfort
4091456 hey i saw where you were saying that you once had issues with pornography how did you overcome it the reason why im asking is because i have a friend who i believe is sexually addicted he knows that he has a problem but doesnt know what to do about it it is hard for me to minister to him because 1 im not a man so im not sure what i say actually relates to what hes going through and 2 he is struggling with having faith in god he attended church for a while but got discouraged and stopped he doesnt believe that prayer or counseling will help him do you know of any resources that could help him any help that you could give will be greatly appreciated
4091457 shoot negro im not hooked on this junk ive been smokin it and snortin it for 12 years if i was hooked id know by now
4091458 cast all our cares anxieties upon god because he cares
4091459 we are inviting the whole community to come celebrate the preservation of this working farm
4091460 this is maine farmland trusts first project in the midcoast region and its success is due to the amazing response from the community over 350 families and businesses have contributed so far and we are very close to our 1 1 million campaign goal
4091461 we reached out to the broad community and got such wonderful feedback and enthusiasm for preserving this piece of farmland the positive response is an indication that people are getting more interested not only in preserving farms but in supporting agriculture in general
4091462 everyone knows that when the truce was declared there were already hundreds of grad missiles there
4091463 this new funding that starts in october is going to build on our previous research but it has more of a lifespan focus
4091464 the special olympics does screenings for thousands of people around the world and were going to be working with them to look at some of that screening data
4091465 the special olympics population is very much a convenience sample for uic
4091466 its one thing to show something in a lab or a clinic but we will want to show how to improve lives in the real world
4091467 having had an std roughly quadruples a womans odds of reporting sexual pain and triples her lubrication problems
4091468 sexual dysfunction among older adults prevalence and risk factors from a nationally representative u s probability sample of men and women 57 to 85 years of age
4091469 the results point to a need for physicians who are treating older adults experiencing sexual problems to take into account their physical health and also consider their mental health and their satisfaction with their intimate relationship in making any assessment
4091470 bob beck was a remarkable guy who ultimately changed the way we see things that are invisible to light
4091471 he provided much of the foundation for the detection and processing of radiologic signals his work still serves as the basis for the design for many modern systems
4091472 in many ways bob set the stage for the emergence of nuclear medicine
4091473 he brought much needed rigor to the field of imaging systems in those days you almost never saw an equation in the journal of nuclear medicine but one of bobs first papers had about 50
4091474 to this day many nuclear imaging systems are based on his ideas and calculations on how collimators the devices that select and screen the raw data for single photon images perform
4091475 from high school days bob was pointed to a career in physics
4091476 but he was deeply troubled by the moral issues raised by the role of physics in the atomic bomb project
4091477 his vision and passion for nuclear medicine and imaging science have inspired our own life long commitment to research in these areas
4091478 he taught and led by example and he set a fine one always thinking about others before worrying about himself
4091479 this was proof of principle in patients who had failed the standard therapies and had few if any remaining options
4091480 we had encouraging results including several long term survivors in patients with stage iv cancers that had spread to distant sites
4091481 previous studies determined the maximal radiotherapy doses for single organs
4091482 but this technique has not been tested for simultaneous use on multiple organs so we designed a dose escalation trial to determine the optimal dose starting with fairly low levels and increasing the dose in later groups of patients
4091483 we have seen improved response rates with higher radiation doses without an increase in side effects yet
4091484 and several of them remain disease free one of them three years after treatment
4091485 these findings may suggest a new approach to treating serious strep infections by supporting our bodys natural defense system
4091486 lacking this single protease the mutant strep strain was easily killed by human neutrophils
4091487 in addition the mutant strep bacteria no longer produced a spreading infection when injected into the skin of experimental mice
4091488 in addition to attempting to kill the bacteria directly with standard antibiotics new treatment strategies could be targeted to inhibit the strep protease and thereby disarm the pathogen making it susceptible to clearance by our normal immune defenses
4091489 a lot of teams in the competition can be very successful with a tupperware can a little computer and two thrusters
4091490 weve kind of outdone ourselves making this biomimetic hydrodynamic vehicle with really novel propulsion capabilities it gives us a lot of cool points but making it work has been kind of a black magic that we had to figure out we started by designing the hull and choosing a novel propulsion system and then went backwards and tried to figure out how to control the thing
4091491 they custom built a water tight lid for the electronics housing in exchange for two cases of beer
4091492 they were very cool to us they were even offering to make it out of titanium
4091493 whats really neat about these things is that you can get a force vector in any direction you want people use these for tugboats but theyve recently become popular among radio control boat hobbyists were the first ones im aware of who have ever used these for an underwater vehicle with the vsps the stingray can behave just like a helicopter only underwater
4091494 its compactness is its downfall we get a lot of points for our low weight but it is hard to get everything we need into such a small space
4091495 we use lithium polymer batteries and lithium explodes when it gets wet several times it looked like a small bomb went off in our computer case we successfully transformed several hundred dollars worth of motor controllers into soot
4091496 the primary benefit for the autonomous robotics community is the development of extremely autonomous robots
4091497 in addition a big thing for me has been networking with students from all over the world even though this is a competition theres been nothing but support all the teams are cheering for each other our hydrophones werent working very well and the team from north carolina state said they had some lying around and we had people writing code for other people everyones pulling for one another
4091498 the autonomous robot community is pretty small so this is a good opportunity to meet all the up and comers in the industry
4091499 almost all of us have had job offers i feel like were advancing our understanding of how real engineering problems get solved this process has been astounding and something ive never been able to learn in a classroom on a whiteboard it comes from pounding your head against a keyboard for hours and hours at a time before serendipity strikes and you figure out what the problem is its really good real world experience for students who have never seen anything like this
4091500 the apollo moon shot and the human genome project rallied support for massive r amp d efforts that created the capabilities to overcome obstacles that were not contemplated at the outset of these initiatives
4091501 similarly todays barriers to improving biofuels are significant but genetics and genomics can catalyze progress towards delivering in the not too distant future economically viable and more socially acceptable biofuels based on lignocellulose
4091502 over the past 10 000 years wild plant species were selected for their desirable traits resulting in todays highly productive food crops we simply dont have thousands of years in the face of the energy and climate challenges so by applying the power of genomics to these problems we are seeking to speed up the domestication of energy crops and the technologies for converting them to suitable biofuels as a more carbon neutral approach to meeting part of our transportation needs
4091503 with the data that we are generating from plant genomes we can home in on relevant agronomic traits such as rapid growth drought resistance and pest tolerance as well as those that define the basic building blocks of the plants cell wall cellulose hemicellulose and lignin biofuels researchers are able to take this information and design strategies to optimize the plants themselves as biofuels feedstocks altering for example branching habit stem thickness and cell wall chemistry resulting in plants that are less rigid and more easily broken down
4091504 using this prospecting technique we can survey the vast microbial biodiversity to gain a better picture of the metabolic potential of genes and how they can be enlisted for the enzymatic deconstruction of biomass and subsequent conversion to high energy value fuels
4091505 given the daunting magnitude of fossil fuel used for transportation we will likely have to draw from several different sources to make an appreciable impact with cellulosic biofuels all of which will in some significant way will be informed by genomics
4091506 toward this end rapid new sequencing methods and the large scale genomics previously applied to sequencing the human genome are being exploited by bioenergy researchers to design next generation biofuels higher chain alcohols and alkanes with higher energy content than petroleum and more adaptable to existing infrastructure

4091521 most of our logs come from the north if we cant get any well have to go to plan b
4091522 if you drive along the highways up there you will see dead trees all over the place sales of ash trees are way down
4091523 if you find an ash borer the tree is most likely already dead
4091524 it has already adversely affected us but we havent missed a days work
4091525 we can only slow it down long term we will have to look at other options other species of wood and we already have plans under way to do that
4091526 in our area because of how much ash grows in the appalachian region especially
4091527 we may be safe for many years with no problem but if it were brought into this area on firewood or shrubbery that would speed up the process
4091528 there are a lot of ash trees in marietta in our parks and in our private yards
4091529 this is a common tree in our area one that has been planted here for many years
4091530 if a couple show up in the traps we know we have them here
4091531 so far none have been found in washington county we are watching closely
4091532 if you go camping purchase firewood in the county where you are camping do not take it along and do not bring leftover wood back with you
4091533 water them mulch well dont knick the tree with your mower and treat all your trees with respect
4091534 wisconsin has already released three species of wasp in hopes of stopping the ash borer
4091535 there is hope the insects move one half mile a year we must slow the movement
4091536 this study will help us to access the grant monies needed for this final piece
4091537 and i will not use money from our city coffers for this project
4091538 im sorry that the mayor pledged we should not take money out of the city coffers for the rathbone drainage project
4091539 i think those people have paid taxes like everyone else were just asking for work to be done in our area and this isnt something council hasnt done before
4091540 there are very finite resources in city funds for projects like this so we want to match up grant funds with the project
4091541 the hope is that we can get enough data to get some grant money
4091542 its especially getting difficult to obtain competitive grants for stormwater drainage projects because they dont score as high as streets projects for example
4091543 we just wanted to end our flooding problem so we had our basement waterproofed three or four years ago and weve had no problem whatsoever since then
4091544 the girl told me that the defendant was present for the birth his name is on the birth certificate and there wasnt any possibility of anyone else being the father

4091607 if you dont have anyone in your township who has to use a wheelchair thats wonderful but if you were to have a person who gets into an accident and then has to rely on a wheelchair that person has to be able to enter the polling place independently

4091609 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4091610 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4091611 either ridge or sen joe lieberman would be a transformative vp pick who could help open up the republican party and deliver moderate voters and independents some mccain advisers believe mccain is seriously weighing that option sources say
4091612 but its a tough calculus a pro choice nominee would infuriate the anti abortion element of the conservative base and potentially be a bitter divorce from the religious right

4091619 marge was a gentlewoman and she could always see all sides of the issue
4091620 over the years marge has guided our community through a sea of issues and not of few problems with patience common sense and vision
4091621 marge always quietly but effectively advocated the interests of those less fortunate
4091622 she was dedicated to rockport and she was a very good selectman
4091623 she was very good about devoting her time to all five districts of the town
4091624 in essence she acknowledged no barriers and in her own case made light of her difference with humor
4091625 when setting out to meet new clients for a real estate viewing for example she would tell them that she would be easy to recognize because she was the only chinese woman in town
4091626 you have to have appropriate fiscal management to allow the state to do the rest of the work of the legislature and the governor
4091627 state treasurer david lemoine said the department will no longer invest tax dollars into such risky ventures
4091628 we think we will be paid we think we will be paid in full
4091629 lemoine said he believes the state will be paid back the 20 million plus interest but that its impossible to know when
4091630 its probably safe to say if we had known we would not have allowed that investment to proceed
4091631 we have a three tiered screening process for figuring out where these funds go and that process was in operation
4091632 this was in no way a subprime investment it now seems accurate to say that the mainsail situation is the result of last summers subprime investment concerns but the situation developed despite the high quality ratings applied to both the company and its underlying assets i am confident the state will recoup the investment so long as we do not succumb to panic selling
4091633 lemoine said he initially thought the state would get its money back relatively quickly and that he didnt see it as an emergency
4091634 treasury had some of the most qualified professional advisers in the nation working with us when the mainsail ii investment was made last august
4091635 lemoine said mainsail ii still has assets that can be sold and the states chances of getting its money back depend on what price those assets are sold at
4091636 lemoine believes the state is in a good position among those owed money from the mainsail ii fund but he said he dare not predict when the matter will be resolved
4091637 the states 20 million investment last year in a mortgage backed fund that went from a top credit rating to junk bond status almost overnight was worth less than 7 million at the close of the fiscal year june 30 barring a dramatic increase in the mainsail ii funds value the state would have to write off more than 13 million if it were sold today
4091638 what is happening in this state is like gestapo methods of controlling people and kennels breeders pet centers frankly im afraid of this department the state animal welfare program very afraid
4091639 as a dog owner i believe fully in the old adage that you can judge a person by how they treat animals it is our responsibility to care for the well being of our pets and we must ensure that those who mistreat animals of any kind are made accountable for their actions
4091640 our children can go outside especially in the summer and play in the fields
4091641 organic is more responsible than pouring pesticides over the ground
4091642 las circunstancias fueron extremas el bombardeo a la ciudad capital de osetia del sur ha provocado esta respuesta militar
4091643 el nico objetivo de las acciones rusas en la zona fue y sigue siendo defender a los ciudadanos rusos as como a los surosetios para los cu les somos garantes internacionales de su seguridad y protectores ante el exterminio indiscriminado
4091644 although not directly about the events of 7 7 the film deals with incredibly sensitive issues and we felt that 11july was simply too close to the third anniversary of the attacks
4091645 while we are mindful that the families are still grieving it is important to look at the climate within which londoners now live and work and have been forced to deal with on an ongoing basis everywhere people of asian appearance have borne the brunt of increased stopping and searching
4091646 three years on and at a time when assistant comissioner of the met police tarique ghaffurs situation is at the forefront of the london agenda i think londoners will find the film very insightful
4091647 the entire project has been funded by me and distributed independently as i strongly felt it was a topic that needed to be addressed it does raise some uncomfortable racial issues but once uk audiences see the film they will i hope see that the film portrays a balanced viewpoint and leaves the audience to decide which side they wish to be on
4091648 having lived and worked in london for many years i became very aware of and affected by how peoples attitudes were changing towards me
4091649 the fact that i had always found london to be an extremely culturally tolerant city made this change in atmosphere all the more shocking
4091650 i am quite satisfied that this amounts to misconduct in the investigation and prosecution of this case and i categorise it egregious
4091651 i have endured that stigma for 15 years its fair to say it has ruined my life yet until now i have never received the slightest apology from the authorities for my ordeal
4091652 i admit i got a bit emotional it means so much to me a lot of wild figures had been bandied about but what i wanted more than money was for people to realise they got it wrong
4091653 ausschlaggebend wird in erster linie die frage sein ob die form f r eine dreiw chige rundfahrt schon gut genug ist sollte das nicht der fall sein berlasse ich meinen platz lieber einem anderen teamkameraden der dann sicher eine gr ere hilfe f r die mannschaft sein kann
4091654 doch auch die deutschland tour reizt mich nachdem ich schon eine ewigkeit nicht mehr vor heimischem publikum gefahren bin
4091655 the situation is dire at the moment we are living very much hand to mouth
4091656 everytime i bring my daughter here the relief knowing that shes fine as we walk away is everything
4091657 snappy cannot close our world would crash if it did and i dont know what wed do
4091658 we understand the team has apologized and meant no offense the matter rests there for the ioc beijing olympic committee spokesman wang wei said thursday he hadnt seen the photo and couldnt comment on it the oca an organization representing asian pacific americans found the photo disturbing the leader of madrids bid for the 2016 games said it was an isolated incident
4091659 i think they meant it as a friendly thing they are really nice guys as you know they have chinese sportswear brand li ning as sponsors
4091660 i dont give more importance to it we are talking in our bid about inclusiveness we are talking about how we want to use the sports values to change to create a new model of living together in madrid we live with 190 nationalities together
4091661 was generated by the bad faith shown by several media organizations that wanted to damage the image of not only the feb but also our country and our sport
4091662 this should just be about sports without any of that other noise
4091663 we feel bad but there is too much talk about it we are a very multicultural country in spain we are for sure going to apologize
4091664 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
4091665 im going to take a look at the video i know theres a couple things i can work on throughout semis and finals everyone is going to keep going faster
4091666 its something ive never experienced swimming two different races in the same day especially coming off such a big final sullivan said
4091667 but i think i coped well got through the heats well and got a lot more in store for tomorrow
4091668 but if you dont believe youre going to swim fast and you can do it just dont come out and swim because youre not going to give yourself a chance
4091669 just remember fans take losses much harder than the majority of players do
4091670 ive kind of given that up now and i just play along
4091671 its one of those dreams you have as a child in america
4091672 ive been working for this for the last eight years especially the last four and to time everything right on one day is an accomplishment of its own
4091673 lance lives a life im not at all familiar with
4091674 no movie stars or million dollar bank accounts for me
4091675 i had started having some pain in my hips for a few months but im kind of a self confident person and thought i could diagnose myself
4091676 i would ice my joints and take anti inflammatories and just push through
4091677 my doctor said i needed to stop running and quit doing impact sports and i handled it real well
4091678 i went home and told my husband my life was over my husband is a funny guy too he suggested my life wasnt over i was just going to have to join the real world and get myself a job
4091679 a lot of the frameworks and walls built because of the old financial world we grew up in will come down
4091680 people think theyre diversifying by investing in a country and it leads to inadequate diversification
4091681 because the country of origin or incorporation is not the primary influence on the stock price
4091682 well be thinking in terms of global markets all the time
4091683 if you have young people in india africa or latin america borrowing from the wealthy
4091684 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
4091685 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
4091686 we have so many things in common with home especially our mutual commitment to producing great work and having a great time doing it were looking forward to collaborating on some wonderful projects with home as our sister company
4091687 we are absolutely thrilled to be associated with and its multi award winning feature documentary talent their excellence in commercials and long form content for the web is a great addition to the home corp brand
4091688 so looks like you have a brand new baby there how old is he
4091689 given us an inward and spiritual grace but not necessarily an outward and visible sign

4091693 lets kill diem and take over the government of south vietnam so we can effectively prevent communist domination of southeast asia
4091694 essentially mr president this is a choice between limited action and unlimited action and most of us think that its better to start with limited action
4091695 last year i fought month after month staying in the gym with no time off because i was determined to reach my goal of fighting for the wbc youth title which i did in september
4091696 this year my goal is to get into the rankings by fighting a well known fighter who is ranked
4091697 ive been trying to get this fight ever since the amateurs
4091698 i heard about him when i was 17 years old because he was doing things on national level i wanted to be where he was so i wanted to fight him but i didnt have the points like he did
4091699 the amateur game is all about points points scored in the fights and points to get you into the national tournaments i didnt have those points because i wasnt taught very well early on and i lost a lot when i was a kid i probably lost 20 out of 60 amateur bouts but by the time i was 17 and 18 years old i felt i was good enough to beat stars like escobedo
4091700 that move changed everything because it gave me the opportunity to train with the best pros in the business and i got the kind of experience you cant get in the amateurs
4091701 i trained with barrera mosley de la hoya forrest and corrales i sparred with shane vernon barrera robbie peden and panchito bojado at a time when his career was hot
4091702 back then escobedo was on top of the food chain he was no 1 in the u s and he was from california so naturally i wanted to fight him for the rep
4091703 now i want to fight him because hes a former olympian hes world ranked and lets be honest hes not some pooh butt fighter hes a name and he can fight hes got heart
4091704 ive waited a long time to fight on tv so im going to put on a show for my fans who believe me will pack the house and for the folks watching telefutura
4091705 ever since we were in camp with barrera i thought i could beat escobedo i hate to sound cocky but when you know you know the first thing i thought when i watched him spar with barrera was i can beat this guy
4091706 looking at his last four fights all i could think about was what i would have done if i was in there with him
4091707 im not trying to diss him because hes a good technical fighter and a good counter puncher but he cant move like me and he dont set up his punches like me
4091708 the footwork i beat him at that speed i beat him at that too power were about the same at that but i see myself landing better combinations cleaner shots out boxing him out maneuvering him and beating him to every punch
4091709 its going to be a fun fight to watch even though were both boxers its going to be a chess match but its going to be fast and furious youre going to see lots of jabs 100 each round from both of us and the crowd is going to be into it like i said my fans will fill that place up they pack the house whenever i fight in ontario and rialto is only about 30 minutes from morongo
4091710 we never sparred with each other when we were in barreras camp
4091711 we knew better he knew and i knew that it would only be a matter of time before wed fight each other
4091712 ive known him sine i was 10 year old and ive trained with him for the past few years
4091713 once he won the world the title it opened my eyes to my own potential it let me know that whenever i get the opportunity to advance my career i have to take it it let me know that its my time
4091714 november 1st is the date thats been mentioned but its not set in stone i know top rank is looking at november 1st and dodger stadium but the opponent is still unknown right now
4091715 there are no hbo dates available and showtime doesnt have the budget to show the fight late in the year so if margarito does fight in november it could be on showtime pay per view
4091716 the fight tony wants is de la hoya everyone tells me that fight wont happen and they are probably right but tony doesnt want to give up that easy its a dream fight for him and lets be honest its the big money fight that he and we have always wanted
4091717 there really isnt any other big money fight for us its not like were going to get a cotto rematch anytime soon theres the winner of mosley mayorga but that probably wouldnt happen until early 09
4091718 if he fights this year it would probably be clottey but ive heard that he says his arm is still hurt
4091719 margarito will start training in about a week but he might not fight until next year
4091720 he does good ratings on telefutura and hes a fun tv fighter if fights against berto clottey or cotto dont happen well just keep him busy on telefutura before the year is out
4091721 watching sports history unfold before their eyes and world records falling like dominoes just isnt exciting enough for the american people
4091722 lets have nonstop 24 7 bob costas action to go with it
4091723 i am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt with the evidence of the two police officers and therefore i find him guilty

4091727 all my family have something to come out for now they probably wouldnt have come if i hadnt won
4091728 i still cant believe what happened but this right hand of mine has just come on so much im going to savour that win im going to watch it all night on video
4091729 the guy ive got next is no mug and i owe him one because he beat me as a kid
4091730 but i know what ive got to do and thats beat him to get a medal
4091731 he was gone one more big punch and he would have been finished hand on heart i paid him too much respect in the first and i felt his right hand but knew i could take his power
4091732 but i landed a right and felt my knuckles on his jaw it was bone on bone then i caught him again and i could see that he had gone
4091733 secondly my strategy is quite good and i stuck to it
4091734 i took advantage of my height and kept distance from my opponent
4091735 ive only ever dreamed of winning an olympic medal since i was six years old and im so close now
4091736 you never know how the countback score is going to go and i was praying to god to let me win
4091737 billy joe is awesome already so hes going to be doubly awesome in 2012
4091738 the points didnt go for me today in the last round i knew i wouldnt get the decision unless i knocked him out the scoring here is so bad for an olympic games its unbelievable
4091739 i had the psychological advantage because my opponent is stronger than me so i have no pressure
4091740 secondly my strategy is quite good i took advantage of my height and kept distance from my opponent
4091741 i thought the scoring was a little bit inconsistent especially in the third round
4091742 its not sour grapes i think billy did lose the bout but what better place for him to get experience for the london games in 2012
4091743 it was a relief because its been a long week and theres a lot of pressure on us
4091744 the teams been so successful that it puts pressure on you to come through
4091745 it would have been an honor to fight de la hoya on his last fight capping a very illustrious boxing career but under the circumstances the option left is to move on i have already made specific instructions to my lawyer to start negotiating with bob arum for my next fight with any possible opponent at 135 lbs
4091746 gbp ceo richard schaefer and i had a good meeting and we resolved the other issues
4091747 oscar wanted 70 30 and richard and i figured that there would be room for movement oscar was supposed to come in to los angeles this week to meet with richard in person but he didnt make it and had to do it on the telephone oscar was adamant about it being 70 30 or no deal richard told me that and that i transmitted it to pacquiao and his people in the philippines they told me that there was no deal and to look to make another fight
4091748 pacquiao has an adviser and lawyer gacal who basically is caught up in percentages but if you go buy a car or a house or food do you pay in percentages or in money the answer is you pay in currency not in percentages i hope this has properly been explained to manny
4091749 a boxer is not good unless he is like somebody who goes to church every sunday you can see the difference in the reactions and the mind
4091750 it was a horrible fight but the build up was so long and im just glad i got rid of this pressure
4091751 ive been spurred on by all the messages of support ive received here in beijing and back home ive only ever dreamed of winning an olympic medal since i was six years old and im so close now
4091752 in the last round i knew i wouldnt get the decision unless i knocked him out the scoring here is so bad for an olympic games its unbelievable
4091753 i felt my performance was exceptional but ive had better days i felt i should have had six or seven points for my body shots but theyre not scoring body shots you might as well do fencing not boxing if theyre going to do that
4091754 this is why i love it and why i want to take part in this great party here
4091755 before the start of the competition i need to be thinking more but when i go into the ring i know i dont have to think about anything because all the chinese people stand beside me

4091782 her dad was understandably shocked when she called from vegas and told him she was getting married he had all the questions about max that any father would
4091783 but peaches was defiant reassured him he was a really nice lad who went to harvard and was not into drugs she basically said she was doing it anyway and that she hoped she could have his support
4091784 bob realised she was going to get hitched anyway he said on this one youre on your own youve made your bed and now you lie in it
4091785 bob told her that shes 19 now that she lives away from home and is old enough to learn from the decisions she makes
4091786 he told her there would be massive flak from the newspapers but she just said it would be good for her career peaches said she knew what she was doing that marriage was a step towards stability
4091787 she didnt miss out the chance to remind him that her and her mum had a rock and roll wedding in vegas
4091788 the bottom line is that bob said he would be there to pick up the pieces if it all went wrong but all that has made peaches even more determined to make the marriage work
4091789 i see him all the time at least once a week
4091790 we still have feelings for each other i still love him and i think he loves me
4091791 we were both really attracted to each other he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
4091792 you never knew if they were broken up or not because it changed from day to day
4091793 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
4091794 like a dagger going through my heart it hurt so bad
4091795 he thought she was just saying she was pregnant to get him back because at that point they were broken up once again he told me it wasnt true and not to worry
4091796 at no point did he say kelli shes pregnant we cant do this anymore its not right we would hang out and hook up
4091797 i dont know where jamie lynn thought he was he probably said he was just going out with the guys but really he was coming to be with me
4091798 he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop but even after we stopped we would still kiss occasionally
4091799 i think that he is trapped when i see jamie lynn doing interviews and talking about how happy she is with casey it seems so fake shes trying to paint a pretty picture but its messy art
4091800 i want the best for him i would never trap him into a life with me i would want casey to be with me for the right reasons because he wanted to

4091824 i find it very satisfying i wouldnt use the word pride because pride is something from the devil and the way you can actually do this is kind of work is to be very humble

4091832 there is now a pincer movement trying to silence critical discussion of homosexuality
4091833 we have achieved measurable success in many regards we have also faced a number of challenges including the issues with our initial business arrangement in cambodia while we are disappointed with our early earnings results this year we believe that we have identifiedour challenges and are implementing solutions that will make us a very strong company going forward in fact these initiatives have already shown very strong improvements in q3 we are learning improving and remaining firmly committed to capitalizing on the tremendous growth opportunities ahead of us
4091834 while mindful of supporting growth during these critical early stages of our business we believe we can implement cost reductions and reduce cash expenses we are also actively seeking strategic alternatives for our table game business
4091835 optimization initiatives effected in the 2008 second quarter are leading to growth in win per day per device with reported average win per day per device average net win for the month of july was 51 47 for the philippines and 56 for cambodia up from 33 in june and 29 for the second quarter this represents increases of 55 and 76 respectively total net revenue for the month of july was 388 821 an increase of 36 from 284 170 in june
4091836 we have also renegotiated all of our contracts in cambodia and have materially increased our revenue sharing in this market we continue to re evaluate underperforming venues an if necessary we will re deploy the machines to a venue that can provide a venue where a more appropriate return can be achieved
4091837 the company continues to look to add new venues to our contract pipeline our primary focus remains on quality and not quantity we believe the new agreements that we have are for high value and high return locations this approach will insure that we develop a strong base of attractive and sustainable venues from which we can continue to grow our business we expect to end the year with 14 18 venues in operation we are also actively reviewing several other exciting opportunities we project that the company will turn ebitda positive in the second half of 2009

4091840 we experienced net losses for the quarter due to a number of factors as we work to restructure our operations despite our increased net loss for the quarter cash used in operations improved approximately 16 over q1 of 2008
4091841 while the top line performance improvements are encouraging there are a number of strategic steps that we need to take in order to position us for growth and profitability in the future the combination of our best in class solutions intellectual property and in house industry expertise give us the unique ability to deliver the most flexible and efficient system solutions for commercial and utility scale renewable energy applications and drive the next generation of power conversion solutions
4091842 we are expanding our global reach in 2008 we have seen an increased demand for our solutions in both europe and asia in addition to our focus in north america we are committed to accelerating international growth we are actively pursuing direct sales and channel partnerships in strategic markets these new regions will be supported by international service networks to insure ongoing high service quality and support
4091843 we are also committed to building a sustainable business model that will position us to achieve profitable growth this includes implementing specific cost reduction strategies and focusing on our core business while rationalizing other segments of the business that are not aligned with our vision at the same time we are increasing our production capabilities to address the demand for renewable energy solutions

4091869 nicht nur fortgeschrittene golfer sind die zielgruppe f r regionale anbieter sondern ebenfalls die gro e anzahl an interessierten nicht golfern die erst w hrend des urlaubs golf ausprobieren somit tr gt golf generell zu einer attraktivit tssteigerung des freizeitangebotes in einer region bei im land werden bereits heute rund 360 000 bernachtungen durch golftouristen gez hlt

4091960 one of the important aspects in the design of deposit insuranmce systems is the determination of the coverage level
4091961 in the main the credibility of the scheme depends in part on the extent of coverage
4091962 the above notwithstanding even when a dis is composed of and supported by many well designed features including aligned mandates and powers appropriate coverage level and scope as well as adequate funding among others it cannot be effective and would not achieve its objectives if stakeholders are unaware of its existence or unclear about the terms and conditions of coverage
4091963 all the three parties are in agreement in everything except on one sticking point which he tsvangirai has requested to reflect and consult on before he comes back to the negotiation table
4091964 three times he agreed to this one aspect and three times he changed his mind
4091965 the point is not critical and the dialogue process can proceed without that
4091966 we have dealt with all the elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
4091967 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters
4091968 im quite confident they will resolve all their outstanding matters which would result in this inclusive government and in the second instance then acting together
4091969 negotiations would continue while consultations are being made there is a single issue to which tsvangirai has reservations and we have to respect that so the talks have been adjourned
4091970 we are determined to put national interests first than self interests and partisanship to craft an obtaining settlement to heal our country while promoting the recovery and transformation of our economy
4091971 this dialogue must not be allowed to crumble all parties must work together and put national interests above petty and personal interests
4091972 we are negotiating as zimbabweans and we want the dialogue to succeed so the international community should not act to destroy the spirit of discussion
4091973 we condemn violence in whatever form including the sanctions imposed even as we hold the talks the sanction should be condemned without reservation
4091974 it is not productive to destroy the spirit of rapprochement the zimbabweans appetite to discuss their issues the west should show confidence and respect by allowing the countrys leaders to hold talks without meaningless intervention
4091975 personally i have known the zimbabwean leadership for a long time
4091976 even if it means spending six months in zimbabwe then we will do it as long as it will bring an end to the challenges that the country is experiencing
4091977 let us give the zimbabwean leaders breathing space to resolve their differences

4092017 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species
4092018 we can never insure one hundred percent of the population against one hundred percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life but we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job and against poverty ridden old age this law too represents a cornerstone in a structure which is being built but is by no means complete it is a structure intended to lessen the force of possible future depressions it will act as a protection to future administrations against the necessity of going deeply into debt to furnish relief to the needy the law will flatten out the peaks and valleys of deflation and of inflation it is in short a law that will take care of human needs and at the same time provide for the united states an economic structure of vastly greater soundness
4092019 basically bill in portland maine is a technological troglodyte and proud of it

4092035 we had four guys on our team last year who could start on team usa right now and paul smyth could pitch on this team
4092036 theres a lot of hysteria that the turmoil in the credit market will mean students cant get loans
4092037 but students should be thinking really hard about whether they should be taking out private loans in the first place
4092038 students will likely apply for private loans and strike out
4092039 that will force them to get informed about their other options
4092040 students and their parents have so many misconceptions about federal loans
4092041 part of it is a higher fertility rate for some of the minority groups hispanics in particular
4092042 those groups also tend to be more of the childbearing age non hispanic white people tend to be a little bit older

4092046 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4092047 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4092048 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4092049 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4092050 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
4092051 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
4092052 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
4092053 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
4092054 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
4092055 liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security
4092056 its got everything i need a couple of beds a mini fridge room for my guitar my clothes my computer
4092057 besides im insane i wouldnt go out with me i dont own much i used to collect old martin and gibson guitars but i ended up giving them away when i have a lot of things its too much to worry about the less i have the better i feel it feels really good to give things away my cds even my clothes if i have too many
4092058 she told me she wrote songs and i came back to watch her perform at an open mike night she had an untamed crazy energy and these poems she used to sing no structure to them at all she was into pottery and stained glass didnt know the beatles from the stones
4092059 i dont know much about what makes a hit song timing has a lot to do with it i think
4092060 i wasnt tempted to do it again im not organized enough i dont care enough she was my girlfriend and that song was special you cant force magic to happen

4092066 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4092067 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4092068 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4092069 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4092070 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4092071 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4092072 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4092073 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4092074 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4092075 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4092076 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

4092078 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4092079 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4092080 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4092081 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4092082 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4092083 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4092084 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4092085 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4092086 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4092087 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4092088 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4092089 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4092090 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4092091 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4092092 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4092093 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4092094 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4092095 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4092096 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4092097 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4092098 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4092099 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4092100 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4092101 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4092102 we wish marlon all the best he is a good pro and he made a contribution last season

4092110 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4092111 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4092112 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4092113 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4092114 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4092115 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4092116 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4092117 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4092118 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4092119 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4092120 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4092121 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4092122 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4092123 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4092124 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

4092131 it is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge
4092132 a student focused learning environment contains the voice and culture of the student
4092133 teachers situations too may push against creating such an environment because of lack of time and energy
4092134 is that really going to meet the individual students needs
4092135 think one of the major problems with sustaining an environment is the lack of buy in from other teachers and staff members
4092136 students must not be fearful of being attacked when attempting to engage in unfamiliar territory or exercises
4092137 respond to the social physical emotional and academic needs of all of your students
4092138 how many times does megan really need to blow her nose a day
4092139 how will you engage your students in self assessment reflection and goal setting

4092145 johannesburg to day entered into full possession of the right to designate itself a city
4092146 it was a few minutes after noon when the ordinance which will be known as the charter of this new city status was ceremoniously proclaimed and johannesburg embarked upon a three days programme of festivities to celebrate the consummation of its civic growth
4092147 my sincere felicitations on the auspicious event may the future of your great city be no less glorious than its past
4092148 certainly in 1896 it was the largest urban place in africa south of the sahara its population of almost 102 000 eclipsing that of cape town established 244 years earlier
4092149 as someone who was born and bred in johannesburg albeit on the east rand my heart has always belonged to this city
4092150 johannesburg has a proud tradition of being a hub of music arts and culture many of our greats have made it here the city always held a certain mystery vibe and appeal to me ive always known that joburg would nurture my musical ambitions and i wasnt disappointed heres wishing the city of johannesburg a happy 80th and many many more
4092151 everybody knows me as a proud daughter of the eastern cape
4092152 but i have to give the city of johannesburg its due i moved here six years ago for a very specific purpose to fulfil my musical dream and johannesburg enabled me to make that a reality i will always have a special place in my heart for this city and i plan to prove that on 7 september at jazz on the lake happy birthday jozi may you have many more
4092153 despite the size and brute strength of the average car some weighed more than two tons driving beyond town was still an adventure
4092154 by 1927 there were signs that johannesburg was once again beginning to do what it liked doing best knocking down buildings and building something bigger
4092155 in noord street between eloff and hoek there are several old houses which were among the most swell residences of old johannesburg one has been adapted as a temporary drawing office and in it draughtsmen are working on plans for the new station
4092156 i dont suppose for one thing that theyve got too many genuine johburg old timers on the council otherwise we wouldnt have every johannesburg building turned over to a demolition gang the moment it becomes historical
4092157 to date solar has been a niche product for either really green or really techie homeowners and this is one of the few programs that is bringing it to the general public to the masses
4092158 as the industry evolves and as the products evolves we will get to get point where it will be easier and easier to do and you will need less and less customization but thats just not the case now
4092159 the best place for consumers to find answers to their questions about aging skin is from their dermatologist since we are the experts in the diagnosis and medical surgical and cosmetic treatment of aging skin
4092160 potentially women could save time money and confusion by simply seeking out the advice of a dermatologist rather than guessing what might work for them
4092161 an alpha hydroxy acid aha product can also help remove the dead outer layers of skin leaving the face with a fresh younger appearancek says dr
4092162 ahas are particularly beneficial for wrinkles around the mouth and eyes which are two areas of the face where women would like to see the most improvement
4092163 but the most important thing consumers can do to prevent aging skin and further damage is to protect themselves from the sun
4092164 consumers should wear a broad spectrum sunscreen that blocks both uva and uvb rays from the sun and has a sun protection factor spf of 15 or higher
4092165 as long as patients have realistic expectations of the kind of improvements they can achieve both over the counter or prescription treatments remain a valuable tool in the treatment of aging skin
4092166 all of these options are perfect for people with busy lifestyles who do not want the inconvenience of a long recovery
4092167 each of these procedures can often be performed in under an hour require very little or no downtime and allow healing to occur rapidly most important of all is that there is minimal discomfort to patients during these procedures

4092178 our requirement for moving forward on delisting is a rigorous verification regime and a verification protocol and until we get there i think weve been clear that delisting cant go forward
4092179 at this point it is reasonable to say that august 11th probably will come and go without that happening dennis wilder the national security council director for asia told reporters in beijing today
4092180 we are in discussions with the north we continue to try to work with them on this question of a robust verification regime
4092181 as the president said in seoul we need to have a strong verification regime before we can take action on removing the north koreans from the state sponsors of terrorism list wilder said
4092182 we continue to try to work with them on this question of a robust verification regime but we arent at the point where we are satisfied with what they have put on the table thus far so these discussions will continue
4092183 i believed the removal of north korea from the u s list of terrorism sponsoring nations would never take place what i was told was what i expected
4092184 heavenly father there are a lot of people out there who are open minded and awakening to the holy spirit as we speak we know that there is still time for them to be saved and we pray for them that they will continue to hear your word and see your grace but father there are a lot of hard hearts out there too there are so many people who are angry bitter and scoffing they deny your existence they mock and laugh at our efforts to show your word and theyve hardened their hearts to anything that we might say or do to possibly get them to at least open their minds help give us strength to move on and to continue teaching your word and to continue living by example we want everyone to live out eternity in your kingdom just as much as you do yet we know that many will choose hell over heaven this saddens us as much as it does you too lord continue to use us in the best way that you can in order to spread the gospel and bring people to jesus and come quickly father for your children are weary and tired in christs name amen

4092189 the global war on terror and the conflict in georgia
4092190 for anyone who thought that stark international aggression was a thing of the past the last week must have come as a startling wake up call after all georgia is a small remote and obscure place
4092191 a cease fire that holds is a vital first step but only one
4092192 u s credibility is on the line as the bush administration stumbles to respond to the russian invasion of georgia so far the administration has been missing in action
4092193 set the record straight on reports of the press adjustments more often applied to the reporting of say
4092194 president bush and his administration have taken aggressive action both public and non public to manage this crisis the white house reported last night
4092195 several times with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov and issued a statement calling for an immediate ceasefire
4092196 pre positioned disaster packages valued at 1 2 million to help those in need the packages include basic medical supplies tents blankets bedding hygiene items clothing beds and cots
4092197 this situation can be resolved peacefully weve been in contact with leaders in both georgia and russia at all levels of government georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of august the 6th
4092198 a disaster due to the effects of armed conflict in georgia and usaid provided an initial 250 000 for the local procurement and distribution of emergency relief supplies
4092199 i said this violence is unacceptable i not only said it to vladimir putin ive said it to the president of the country dmitriy medvedev and my administration has been engaged with both sides in this trying to get a cease fire and saying that the status quo ante for all troops should be august 6th and look i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
4092200 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russians relations russias relations with the united states and europe it is time for russia to be true to its word and to act to end this crisis
4092201 i want to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and its people we are reviewing our options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop we will continue to work diplomatically on this matter and will continue our discussions with all the parties involved
4092202 we expect russia to honor its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4092203 which will provide clean water for 20 000 people and medicine for about 400 wounded
4092204 as russian tanks and troops moved through the roki tunnel and across the internationally recognized border into georgia the russian government stated that it was acting only to protect ossetians
4092205 russian claims of humanitarian motives were further belied by a bombing campaign that encompassed the whole of georgia destroying military bases apartment buildings and other infrastructure and leaving innocent civilians wounded and killed
4092206 despite a french brokered cease fire which worryingly does not refer to georgias territorial integrity russian attacks have continued there are credible reports of civilian killings and even ethnic cleansing as russian troops move deeper into georgian territory
4092207 moscows foreign minister revealed at least part of his governments aim when he stated that
4092208 can no longer be our partner it would be better if he went
4092209 in the wake of this crisis there are the stirrings of a new trans atlantic consensus about the way we should approach russia and its neighbors
4092210 the world has learned at great cost the price of allowing aggression against free nations to go unchecked
4092211 we should work toward the establishment of an independent international peacekeeping force in the separatist regions and stand ready to help our georgian partners put their country back together
4092212 at the same time we must make clear to russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world
4092213 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4092214 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4092215 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4092216 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4092217 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4092218 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

4092244 i definitely knew that he wanted to win that game i was injured that day and he told me i had to be here he made me fly back from holland
4092245 i was trying to get ready for the euros euro 2008 and he said to me that just for the spirit of the team he wanted his captain to be there
4092246 if your manager calls you have got to be back when he calls me im there finished i couldnt really say to him i cant come back because i knew what he wanted
4092247 the only thing i can say is that hes a winner and hes a person who tries to make sure that all the players feel comfortable around him
4092248 we have a chance to play for everything and to try and challenge for it all
4092249 we cannot be assured of anything because football is like that i think that the enthusiasm and desire of everyone of the player makes sevilla capable of winning every game
4092250 it is important that everyone is in tune because there is a long season ahead and there will be pitfalls and they can be avoided if we stick together
4092251 unlike players from teams established in the premier league we had no money no reputation or image to project no flash cars and nobody had their mortgage paid off
4092252 we had everything to prove and nothing to lose none of us had played in the premier league but we had nothing to be scared of it was just 11 different players than we had faced before
4092253 this changed in our second season suddenly we had flash cars images egos and everyone knew who we were and when we didnt freshen things up with new players we were in a dangerous situation
4092254 all too quickly we went from being a side that could lose three games and bounce back immediately by winning three games to a side which could lose eight games in a row and that just killed us
4092255 there was a real lord of the flies split which i had never experienced before we didnt feel we were all together and i was partly to blame
4092256 we didnt have the vocal players we needed when things were going wrong but we had people pointing fingers which was not good

4092415 there are no formal reasons to stop these accession talks
4092416 the statements that our accession should be delayed because of events in georgia sound strange
4092417 it contradicts basic logic common sense and promises that were given by the governments of western countries to russia
4092418 sorry for a rude expression but every time they are just fooling us around
4092419 after the july crisis russias accession could have provided support for the organization which is experiencing serious systemic problems
4092420 in this situation i do not think that this resumption of talks with georgia is possible therefore we will look at other ways of solving the problem
4092421 all sides are set to lose due to a delay of russias accession who will lose most is difficult to say

4092445 brazils central bank believes that it has underestimated the strength of its economy and has moved its previous forecast of 4 5 per cent gdp growth for 2008 up to 4 8 per cent
4092446 having studied figures just released which show brazils current gdp to be 749 billion in 2007 up 5 4 per cent on 2006 the official number crunchers decided that theyd been too cautious brazil does seem to be resilient to the turbulence in the northern half of the americas a turbulence which has sent shockwaves across europe and while the spanish property market is currently down on its luck brazil has the very same to thank for making a major contribution to its current fortune
4092447 judging by the figures from its sister resort pousada dos girassois in pipa which enjoys 80 per cent occupancy per year you could stand to make a lot more
4092448 girassois is one of the most successful developments in pipa and the value of property for sale in pipa has doubled in just two years
4092449 the property market in natal is in its relative infancy and the coastline is almost development free supply currently lags way below demand
4092450 new development is springing up alongside sporting and leisure facilities but the authorities are paying great attention to the environment before granting licenses aesthetics and stability are of greater importance to them than squeezing every last penny out of every last square metre
4092451 prices of property for sale in natal are incredibly low right now but outside investment in infrastructure such as golf courses and a new airport will increase demand for property and inevitably trigger natural price hikes
4092452 being the closest part of brazil to europe thus drastically cutting down flying times to between seven and nine hours from most european cities natal has phenomenal beaches a permanent summer and with year round rental potential suits both audiences the pure investor and the holiday home hunter
4092453 the investment in the general infrastructure and tourism in the north east of brazil has been significant over the past few years and is set to continue for the foreseeable future
4092454 the government is committed to developing the area and with the new airport just a couple of years away we feel that property in the natal area and along this coastline of brazil offer some of the most exciting investment opportunities we have seen in a long time

4092492 and with a pat to my head she was gone leaving me with my new boss
4092493 this small democracy far away from our shores is an inspiration to all those who cherish our deepest ideals as i told president saakashvili on the day the cease fire was declared today we are all georgians we mustnt forget it
4092494 can no longer be our partner it would be better if he went
4092495 son los propios creadores de la camiseta los que se encargan de presentar la campa a a sus amigos y conocidos
4092496 damn we forgot to have a fire drill this month and its already the 29th so we better have one sixth period
4092497 it seemed like there was an unmet need in two situations
4092498 recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs and we had children dying whose family wanted to donate and we werent able to do it
4092499 it is a much more common scenario today that it would have been even five years ago
4092500 in my opinion its an open and shut case they dont have irreversibility and they dont have death
4092501 as difficult as that was to hear this opportunity provided us with a ray of hope
4092502 at that point zachary was so sick we did have him at home but we knew it wasnt much longer
4092503 hes just a crazy little kid who loves to play and swim and throw rocks
4092504 estando una vez en berl n me puse a buscar un ba o p bico en la alexanderplatz pero casi me pierdo
4092505 siempre que estoy fuera levanto la vista en busca de un ba o y lo pruebo para luego calificarlo
4092506 to be seen as europes pet is the last thing a presidential candidate needs especially one who wants to shed his elitist image with white working class american voters
4092507 was not designed to be and does not set out to be a political book
4092508 a piece of scholarship and a good one at that

4092511 i have influence i have decision making powers i have my own understanding of biblical morality i will not be quiet i will not acquiesce and make believe that everything is fine and dandy within the clan i will defend the little girl to the last drop of blood in my body
4092512 to know to do good and do it not is sin
4092513 whatever political reasons exist for what happened in south ossetia
4092514 the oil and gas markets find themselves right in the cross hairs of the whole thing resource wars fought over oil and gas pipelines water and other key resources seem likely to have a bigger role in the future politicians though will be quick to dress up any such war as being fought over something else
4092515 it is unlikely that aggression against our nato allies will occur with aircraft and tanks and troops
4092516 a nation could achieve the same and worse effects simply by turning off the taps people freeze industry stops
4092517 given the characteristics of russian diplomacy which have been not only competitive but sometimes gripping people by the throat they are likely to feel irritated that someone else is in the field
4092518 you have the right to freedom and independence we are here to demonstrate our solidarity freedom is worth fighting for
4092519 this country russia seeks to restore its dominance but the time of dominance is over
4092520 we are also looking around at other areas in rochester
4092521 they had a great time together but they are just in different places in their lives right now
4092522 he never ends things with a clean slate he likes to dwell on these relationships and sort everything out before saying goodbye for good
4092523 the number of women so affected negatively by abortion however is extremely low compared to the millions of women who have had legal abortions without negative psychological sequelae or have experienced positive psychological outcomes and enhanced life circumstances after an abortion
4092524 what do you expect when you ask a group comprised mainly of people who say there are no mental health effects of abortion to study the mental health effects of abortion
4092525 the task force observed that many of the studies published during the period reviewed suffered from serious methodological problems thus it focused most closely on those found to be most methodologically sound to arrive at its conclusions
4092526 our message will not be silenced nor will our first amendment rights be abridged

4092529 a n association fallacy is an inductive formal fallacy of the type hasty generalization or red herring which asserts that qualities of one thing are inherently qualities of another merely by an irrelevant association
4092530 a person is known by the company he or she keeps
4092531 in his books obama admits attending socialist conferences and coming into contact with marxist literature but he ridicules the charge of being a hard core academic marxist which was made by his colorful and outspoken 2004 u s senate opponent republican alan keyes
4092532 however through frank marshall davis obama had an admitted relationship with someone who was publicly identified as a member of the communist party usa cpusa
4092533 the reason is apparent davis was a known communist who belonged to a party subservient to the soviet union
4092534 trevor loudon a new zealand based libertarian activist researcher and blogger noted evidence that frank was frank marshall davis in a posting in march of 2007
4092535 em va fer veure la posici solit ria per aquells que no essent sobiranistes defensen la necessitat de un bon finan ament per a catalunya quan conversen sobre aquest tema amb gent de la resta de lestat i t tota la ra amb el que em va dir
4092536 that would also create ground for us to return to the negotiating table
4092537 this is a question of our honor come out of your homes
4092538 i strongly condemn the and the suppression on these oppressed people
4092539 to call for international involvement in the sovereign of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mind set that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past
4092540 this matter of kashmir is not indias it is as much a matter for pakistan as it is for kashmiris
4092541 we wish marlon all the best he is a good pro and he made a contribution last season
4092542 he has worked hard in pre season and has made an impact but he has chosen to move on for the time being
4092543 the first thing i would stress is that it is not for us to be calling manchester united about fraizer
4092544 manchester united are in no doubts as to our intentions on fraizer and if sir alex ferguson decides loaning him out again is the right thing to do i am sure it will be us that he talks to
4092545 drawing inspiration from the simple design of the human eye
4092546 io credo che da qualche parte vaghino le anime irrequiete
4092547 there are moments when we wonder whether all this was worthwhile or not
4092548 i can tell you that what we are doing at the moment is sending a signal that the u n is back the u n is back to stay
4092549 i presume the reason theyre not coming over is to protect the little resources they have
4092550 i am depressed and cant sleep because it has been five months since i last sent my family a penny
4092551 even though the economy is the way it is the workers are the ones who do the work that provide food on our tables
4092552 what would happen if nobody did those types of jobs
4092553 to stay in mexico meant drowning in poverty and misery
4092554 in mexico i was told that the united states was full of opportunities
4092555 at the labor center what we can do is make sure everybody is working a little bit constantly so the jobs are distributed equally
4092556 they have to beg jump and pray for a job without any dignity
4092557 they know that if they go to the park somebody will offer them a 5 or 6 an hour job its not a lot but thats better than nothing
4092558 esta plantilla est capacitada para pelear por los cuatro t tulos

4092576 police are seeking to identify these witnesses and anyone with knowledge of who they are as they may have information vital to help discover the identity of the offenders in this investigation
4092577 the only area where we have failed is to show our genuineness to convince the outsiders about our sincerity in resolving the problem in action we have proved it
4092578 there is nothing negative to what narayanan has said in my opinion he has only put in different words what our president has been saying that we need to defeat terrorism but the ethnic problem needs to be resolved politically
4092579 there is nothing bad against sri lanka in what narayanan has said
4092580 on the whole it is the inability of the president and the government to show the sincerity to the tamils and to the outside world we have to improve that it will take time as for narayanan i understand him very well i know his vision
4092581 it is very clear it is useless talking to the ltte because it is not genuine or sincere ultimately there will have to be a political solution a permanent solution and my solution is political
4092582 the ltte are not in the mullaitivu jungles because they wanted it but because they were pushed into it they would have preferred jaffna peninsula or trincomalee that would have been advantageous because those are built up areas but they were chased away from jaffna chased away from trincomalee however it will take more troops in the sri lankan north because it is a large area
4092583 ultimately we all have to learn to be sri lankans
4092584 the church of madhu and its surrounding area had been used by the ltte terrorists to advance in its guerilla warfare the church had been sown with mines laid with pressure bombs and constructed bunkers to advance in the ltte guerilla warfare fortunately the government of sri lanka and its defense forces have removed all of these war preparations made by the ltte and the church of madhu has been completely renovated in this process some of the members of the armed forces have paid a high price and some have sustained injuries we wish to record our gratitude to h e the president of sri lanka and to the sri lankan defence forces for converting this region towards civil administration
4092585 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4092586 they introduced themselves and at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times
4092587 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend
4092588 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him
4092589 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4092590 bill gwatney was our friend our partys leader and so many times our partys conscience
4092591 our state and our party are better for all that bill gwatney has done
4092592 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
4092593 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4092594 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
4092595 the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
4092596 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
4092597 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
4092598 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4092599 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
4092600 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4092601 i dont think we are going to re ignite the cold war
4092602 president bushs decision to send aid to the people of georgia and americans stand united in support of the men and women who will carry out this humanitarian mission
4092603 must back up its commitment to stop its violence and violation of georgias sovereignty with actions not just words
4092604 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
4092605 were saying the oss was a lot bigger than they were saying
4092606 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
4092607 se trata de una actitud soberbia rabiosa del prefecto rub n costas quien acaba de emitir una resoluci n ilegal e inconstitucional
4092608 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4092609 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4092610 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4092611 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
4092612 during the bid i was the secretary general of the bidding committee
4092613 i was confronted with many questions about the opening up and reform of china and i did say that the olympic games coming to china will help china to open up further and to reform
4092614 of course there are exceptions like in any other country some people are not satisfied that is true
4092615 i think a few a very few people come here to speak to be critical to dig into the small details
4092616 to find fault that does not mean we are not fulfilling our promise
4092617 i ve just had dropped calls and issues like that
4092618 but its a phone and thats what i needed it to be first
4092619 people use the iphone as a pc in their pocket
4092620 apple should change the name to itablet its slightly mispositioned
4092621 21 positions are being eliminated in the austin office of ncsoft in the area of product development primarily this is related to products which we have not previously announced and were in prototype phases
4092622 two weeks after announcing they had sold every one of the record 6 8 million tickets offered for the games olympics officials expressed dismay at the large numbers of empty seats at nearly every event and the lack of pedestrian traffic throughout the park the 2 800 acre centerpiece of the competition
4092623 but say this for him his liberal logic is consistent
4092624 seems that there are more than a couple of folks taking notice of your postings tom excellent job i believe cleveland is better off because of the job you did
4092625 tom blumer at bizzyblog brings actual facts about coal miner fatalities to light and gives the bdsers a reality check
4092626 the best blogger in the state and a more talented natural economist than any of those pointy headed keynesian halfwits
4092627 tom blumer is doing stuff that msnbc and ap should have done before providing the teenager farris hassan a national international forum and 15 minutes of fame
4092628 guys like tom blumer cover what really matters and theyre independent enough to tell the truth without fear of aggravating corporate media owners
4092629 bizzyblog made my point with numbers and facts and stuff
4092630 this is why i read bizzy blog he catches the stuff that i manage to miss
4092631 ik kwam maar voor n ding naar de spelen en dat was de gouden medaille ik baal als een stekker

4092635 you or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
4092636 shows that they cant make the move without a negative impact to the global war on terrorism
4092637 not only are you not able to have the people who will do the job but its going to cost you twice as much and you are going to have to compromise security
4092638 i think all these things are fuel for the fire for us to make point to the committee if we can get another hearing that the dod has not met the test
4092639 its amazing you train so hard preparing for this moment
4092640 our main goal was the team qualification a few days ago today was an extra bonus i came out with the mentality that i wanted to have fun and soak it all in and enjoy the experience
4092641 it was a great experience it was a huge motivator as well
4092642 its going to be good to go home work hard and get ready for the next worlds olympics and all that it will be fun
4092643 it wasnt a big deal im not that strong in that event so i wasnt too upset about it i was excited about all the other events i went though them without any errors
4092644 wir m ssen jemanden finden der im moment unterbewertet ist aber das potenzial f r die liga hat

4092650 we plan to excavate the site location so that the property is graded properly for our mining crew to set up operations prior operations at this mine have established production levels of 2 000 to 2 500 raw tons per day so we are eager to reach these target goals as well
4092651 we are very excited about reopening this mine because the coal seam here is approximately 50 inches in height and contains metallurgical qualities with todays metallurgical prices rising in excess of 180 a ton this makes for an attractive blending option within the marketplace in addition having massey energy nyse mee adjacent to our properties just adds credibility to the coal in this area

4092655 confirmed that the risks are on the downside for growth
4092656 the french economy is not just going through some simple turbulence but is really heading toward a recession at least as bad as in 1993
4092657 today no one has locked up the really good ideas to stay competitive the technology industry has to have internal and external innovation paths
4092658 industry academia collaboration is an open innovation example that can provide competitive advantage to companies that know how to leverage the enormous creative potential of university researchers
4092659 deepening hp labs strategic collaboration with those in academia government and the commercial sector ensures hps research endeavors result in high impact research that meets the scientific and business objectives of hp and its partners
4092660 the professors deep technical expertise hp labs researchers domain and industry knowledge and governments abilities to fund innovative research will come together to address the worlds most complex it challenges
4092661 ive got no reports of any border incidents any cross border incidents so it wasnt us
4092662 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
4092663 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
4092664 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
4092665 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
4092666 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
4092667 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
4092668 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem
4092669 that people want to feel like o k its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind senator obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
4092670 we recognize that in america this is going after somebody who is more comfortable with technology
4092671 the truth is that in other countries its becoming a part of their culture the trend is coming and as a fashion company its very important to identify trends and get ahead of them
4092672 this is about someone whos interested in our brand and interested in technology and wherever the two meet thats whats appropriate
4092673 tal como demuestra el v deo de la agresi n
4092674 espero que las agresoras tengan un juicio justo pero tambi n espero que tengan una condena muy severa porque se tenga la edad que se tenga se es muy consciente de los que se hace cuando ocurren cosas como la que muestra el v deo
4092675 es lamentable que tengamos que perder tanto tiempo y dinero en juicios injustificados y que en nada benefician ni al municipio ni a los vecinos de boadilla estamos hablando de una tercera sentencia sobre si el santander puede o no tener instalaciones deportivas en la ciudad financiera lo cual resulta absurdo
4092676 la secci n entiende que no habi ndose impugnado la aprobaci n definitiva del plan general de ordenaci n urbana el mismo devino firme y consentido y por tanto las licencias concedidas a su amparo son ajustadas a derecho motivos todos ellos por los que procede la desestimaci n del presente recurso contencioso administrativo

4092680 our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery
4092681 while the investigation of this shooting continues and our primary concern remains with bill and his family we commend the courageous and speedy action of law enforcement officials in apprehending the suspect
4092682 were aware of it were helping the state police right now
4092683 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
4092684 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
4092685 its a tradition in military aviation to personalize the aircraft
4092686 if there was a crew chief on the flight line and he was an artist itd be his job to come up with the nose art
4092687 its art but its a piece of history you are restoring
4092688 nose art was a way for the aviation military people a long way from home to bring a touch of their own family or own life to a strange place knowing the next flight they do they might get killed
4092689 some did wives some did girlfriends some did their dogs it was a way to individualize their life in an area far away
4092690 there is a lot of research looking at old photos you look at the characters of that era and you create a template to make it as exact as possible
4092691 its a reproduction of the art carried on one of the last flyable f 14s
4092692 it was titled thanks for the ride and were reproducing that with the cat

4092698 queremos que los funcionarios nacionales contemplen las diversas realidades regionales y un criterio equitativo y federal en la distribuci n de los subsidios se debe modificar la estructura de distribuci n de subsidios para mejorar la situaci n del transporte de pasajeros en el interior del pa s
4092699 nosotros prosigui boggiano creemos que es absolutamente desmedida la cifra que recibe el transporte en el rea metropolitana de buenos aires porque provoca que en el interior se cobren tarifas siempre superiores a las que se abonan all
4092700 esto se agrava porque buenos aires no s lo tiene el transporte de pasajeros mediante mnibus subsidiado sino tambi n el subte y el ferrocarril
4092701 then and from a distance i admired very much the way she handled a uniquely difficult situation with uncomplaining grace

4092753 today we have a price situation whereby it is possible to introduce biodiesel in the country the biodiesel factories that have been built will now to operate and make a slim profit
4092754 if price of cpo really comes down we will recommend to the government to introduce the use of biodiesel in our country particularly in the industrial and transport sectors the biodiesel plants can also make a bigger profit
4092755 we have always encouraged replanting of about five percent of the total hectare but we have never achieved the five percent at most is three percent if the cpo price continues to come down we will definitely give incentives for planters to replant
4092756 this grant supports flambeau river biofuels goal to be a major contributor in achieving the federal governments goal of increasing renewable fuels production and reducing our nations dependence on mideast oil
4092757 with this funding we will be able to accelerate the retrofitting of this mill from a pure pulp and paper plant to a broader production facility that will produce biofuels within the same facility thus sharing key infrastructure elements and costs
4092758 as you can imagine we are very pleased that our technology approach has been recognized by the department of energy as a viable way to produce biofuel from forest residuals one of the most abundant renewable resources in the u s
4092759 since day one our project has received strong support from governor doyle chairman obey and senator kohl and we wish to thank them for all their efforts once operational the biorefinery will serve to validate the technology while creating a compelling new model for the pulp and paper industry that can be proliferated throughout the u s
4092760 a clean energy future depends on combining wisconsin ingenuity with our states resources and i want to congratulate flambeau river biofuels for leading the way
4092761 their proposed biorefinery shows us all that we can have an energy future that creates jobs protects our environment and relies less on mideast oil and more on midwest know how
4092762 this grant will help meet our governments goals of creating new jobs stimulating remote areas re positioning traditional industries for a new world era and most importantly producing clean fuels from renewable resources abundantly found in the u s
4092763 we are proud to be a part of this important initiative by taking a leading position in the advancement of bioenergy technologies and the development of cellulosic biofuels
4092764 at the moment the company is sourcing all the feedstock for this project from local farmers
4092765 to keep costs down we need our own cassava plantation which we are in the process of constructing now
4092766 the study showed that large scale planting of sweet sorghum is feasible here and tsinghuas technology is reliable
4092767 however we do not have sufficient equipment to build a plant on an industrial scale
4092768 this project is a major step forward in the development of technologies to reduce co2 emissions
4092769 with our world leading biomass gasifying technology we are excited to be a key player in this project led by stora enso and neste oil which uses wood based biomass for production of biofuels thereby reducing the use of fossil fuels in transportation

4092869 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4092870 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4092871 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4092910 crude has regained some of its losses over the past few trading sessions reacting to the inventory report which showed very substantial stock draws in gasoline
4092911 concerns about the us economy and now the spread of the economic slowdown to europe and asia could push crude oil pricing to test lower lows because some of the supply issues have been discounted by the market

4092995 mccain said that he is open to choosing a pro choice running mate and named former pennsylvania governor tom ridge as someone who merits serious consideration despite his support for abortion rights
4092996 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4092997 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4092998 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues

4093059 the insurance cover entails the beneficiary rs 15 000 assistance for hospitalisation and an equal amount for his family in the event of his or her death
4093060 the greatest hurdle in combating the dreaded disease is lack of awareness and the stigma associated with hiv aids
4093061 it is a problem to enrol hiv positive people because they want to disclose their hiv status it can be done only through the help of organisations like knp
4093062 the battle against the disease will succeed only through massive awareness programme in both rural and urban areas people are yet to become aware about the disease to control the menace
4093063 people have discovered high levels of repeated sequences in the genomes of most higher species and spun theories about why there are so many repeats
4093064 we have been able to show with yeast that these repeated sequences allow the formation of new types of chromosomes chromosome aberrations and represent one important way of diversifying the genome
4093065 those particular differences may prove to be more successful in natural selection and eventually you may get a new species
4093066 if you have a break in this repeated part you can repair not only from the same chromosome but also from a similar repeated sequence in many other places in the genome

4093094 i have experience doing it a couple years in cincinnati so it was no big transition for me
4093095 i was kind of expecting something like this to happen eventually i just wanted a chance to get on the field
4093096 reggie is a great athlete and hes been out there at that position before and for me i treat him like any other receiver
4093097 but hes also a guy who you know will be in the right place because he sees everything as a quarterback as well
4093098 i still want to groom him as a quarterback because i think he has all the things you want in a quarterback in this league
4093099 he has so many intangibles that only come through by putting him out on the field as a quarterback once he gets seasoned and understands the league a bit more hes going to be a fine quarterback
4093100 i dont come in the next day following games for treatment and to ice my body down

4093105 no one player is more important if i wasnt in there someone else would be
4093106 watching the tape i couldnt figure out why there were so many sacks i couldnt make a judgment since i didnt know what they were doing or being asked but i knew there could definitely be improvements made you could see talent

4093225 financial markets had a positive impact on the investment portfolio overall this quarter as canadian equity markets rose 8 6 per cent on the strength of higher commodity prices and energy stocks which more than offset a decline of 3 4 per cent in other markets due to the ongoing effects of the credit crisis
4093226 fiscal 2008 has been a restructuring year in line with our operational changes to adjust to the current economic environment we felt an examination of balance sheet intangibles was also warranted resulting in our goodwill write down
4093227 while commercial continues to face challenging market conditions with the cyclical slowdown in the western canadian drilling and forest industries optimism exists that we maybe entering an upward swing for the natural gas drilling industry we will persist reducing operating costs in fiscal 2008 but this will be done in a judicious manner so commercial will be well positioned to gain greater market share when our markets return
4093228 during the second quarter of 2008 we continued to solidify our operations and at the same time expanded our fleet by one vessel acquiring our youngest containership we plan to continue expanding our fleet when opportunities arise by selecting vessels from the whole spectrum of the drybulk and containership markets which we believe maximize our return on equity at any given point of the market cycles the growth of our dividend from 0 49 per share for the first six months of 2007 to 0 63 per share for the first six months of 2008 a 29 increase is the best evidence of the effectiveness of our investment and employment strategy especially since it represents only about 60 of our net income and less than 50 of our cash flow our aim is to continue providing consistent and significant dividends throughout the market cycles
4093229 the results of the first six months of 2008 reflect significantly higher revenues compared to the first six months 2007 due to the higher average time charter equivalent rate our vessels have achieved and the higher number of vessels in our fleet
4093230 as of today about 80 of our ship capacity days in the remaining of 2008 have been fixed including the spot voyages already concluded for which the revenue is already known in 2009 34 of our capacity is under time charter contracts or protected from market fluctuations we believe that our contract coverage gives us a solid revenue base for 2008 and 2009 more predictable cash flows and sufficient downside protection while still allowing us to participate in the potential upside of the market

4093249 we are pleased to report that production mining rates and underground development rates have increased compared to the first quarter of this year
4093250 our primary objectives are to increase our current rate of production at the crocodile river mine while maintaining a steady cost structure and to develop and bring crms crocette section and our spitzkop project into production as quickly as possible with our current management team and financial resources we are confident that we can achieve these objectives
4093251 with the recent first shipments to the u s of our exciting new coco convertible we have turned a new page in kandis development in relatively short order we expect that the manufacturing and sales of super mini autos will become our largest business bringing a new growth dimension to the company
4093252 we continue to believe that barring any delays in production or shipping strong consumer interest in our off highway super minis will translate to sales of the new coco convertible in a range of 5 000 to 10 000 vehicles before year end and at a sales price to kandi of approximately 4 000 per vehicle upon delivery this should translate to a contribution of at least 20 million in new revenues to second half and full year results
4093253 given anticipated margins on these sales of up to 30 we expect that overall gross margins in 2008 will exceed the margins achieved last year of 21 5
4093254 we expect continuing growth in our atrv sales in a range of 10 to 20 with a continued concentration on building fewer overall units of more high end vehicles which offer higher margins in this regard we expect to see a boost in sales from our two new utv models for agricultural use
4093255 we have not yet factored into our guidance an anticipated contribution from our newest product line the tt three wheeled motorcycle which offers higher levels of safety and superb mileage with its expected launch in the current quarter it has already generated considerable excitement from our distributors who have seen a dramatic climb in motorcycle imports over the past year
4093256 we fully expect dramatic increases in the sales of our super minis to u s consumers hungry for more exciting fuel efficient cars especially as we add electric powered and gas powered hard tops to the line in the not too distant future
4093257 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
4093258 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
4093259 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
4093260 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
4093261 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal

4093325 die linke fordert seit langem die masseneinkommen zu st rken um konsum besch ftigung und investitionen zu st tzen und sich nicht wie die gro e koalition allein auf die weltkonjunktur zu verlassen die aktuelle situation zeigt dass der export allein die abw rtsspirale von sinkenden einkommen r ckl ufigen verbrauch und entsprechend geringen investitionen nicht auffangen kann der historisch hohe anstieg der verbraucherpreise belastet die einkommen der privaten haushalte zus tzlich und macht ein wirtschaftspolitisches gegensteuern umso dringlicher die privaten haushalte m ssen kurzfristig mit der ausgabe von steuerschecks entlastet werden diese steuerschecks sollen haushalten mit niedrigen und mittleren einkommen zu gute kommen zudem sind mehr ffentliche investitionen in infrastruktur bildung und forschung erforderlich um den konjunkturellen abw rtstrend zu stoppen deutschland kann sich nicht l nger leisten mit die niedrigsten ffentlichen ausgaben aller industriestaaten zu t tigen

4093332 eine genehmigung f r das kohlekraftwerk in moorburg w re klimapolitisch eine katastrophale entscheidung und ein schwerer schlag f r die dringend erforderliche energiewende
4093333 w hrend alle vom stromsparen und den ausbau erneuerbarer energie reden setzt vattenfall voll auf den ausbau der klimasch dlichen stromerzeugung auf kohlebasis selbst wenn es demn chst zur endg ltigen abschaltung des akw brunsb ttel kommt und das heizkraftwerk wedel stillgelegt wird w rde vattenfall mit moorburg und boxberg seine klimasch dlichen stromerzeugungskapazit ten um mehr als 1 000 mw gegen ber heute steigern
4093334 wenn ausgerechnet eine umweltsenatorin der gr nen die genehmigung f r das klimamonster moorburg erteilt machen sich die gr nen in sachen klimaschutzpolitik v llig unglaubw rdig
4093335 die gr ne parteispitze hat bis zu den wahlen immer wieder betont dass sie moorburg verhindern werden noch im februar haben die heutige zweite b rgermeisterin christa goetsch und der jetzige umweltstaatsrat
4093336 das umweltbundesamt hat vorgerechnet dass es trotz des geplanten atomausstiegs und auch ohne das kraftwerk moorburg zu keinen versorgungsl cken in der stromversorgung kommen wird moorburg ist berfl ssig wenn die vorgaben und ziele der bundesregierung eingehalten werden der bruttostromverbrauch soll um elf prozent bis zum jahr 2020 gegen ber 2005 gesenkt werden der anteil der kraft w rme kopplung kwk in der stromerzeugung muss auf 25 bis zum jahr 2020 gegen ber heute verdoppelt werden und der ausbau der erneuerbaren energien auf knapp 30 der stromerzeugung bis zum jahr 2020 weiter gehen

4093339 de russische troepen zijn bezig de stad gori en de haven van poti te vernietigen

4093342 this was a massive challenge and it did not pass without incident our chief executive gary jennison was injured during the climb on scafell pike which left him unable to take part in the final part of the mission
4093343 that said some of our party were beyond fit matt mckenning head of field sales ran the london marathon earlier this year and he quite literally ran down scafell pike he and his colleagues ben clay and stuart williams actually trounced the 24 hour aim and completed all three in 22 and a half hours
4093344 the weather was not kind to us and travelling massive distances 560 miles in all as well as climbing the mountains over the course of just one day was one of the most gruelling experiences any of us will ever undertake
4093345 but the sense of achievement afterward as we tucked into a well deserved pint and a curry was superb quite apart from pushing every one of us to our limits and bringing about a real sense of comradeship we succeeded in raising over 13 000 from our generous sponsors
4093346 that money will be divided between our three nominated charities snap adventure playground in cannock the national institute for conductive education and st marys hospice in birmingham moneyway has always been very determined to raise funds for these causes and last year we raised more than 8 000 for them by the end of april this year we had already raised that and this challenge has smashed all of our records
4093347 we are delighted that we have been able to do this and we are already deciding what we can do next year to top this or we will be when weve stopped aching

4093350 the central cult image of mithraism was the statue of the tauroctony or depiction of mithras slaying the bull
4093351 composting household waste has never been easier there are many containers of different sizes available so everyone could quite easily fit one into their garden its quick easy and convenient just to pop items suitable for composting into a container and leave them to work their magic the end result is some wonderful free compost that can be used to enhance your garden i think the inside out garden is a fun display that will attract lots of people and hopefully encourage many other residents to start home composting
4093352 its great news he could be available again in three weeks
4093353 its been passed down from the regiment that there is a threat of insurgents utilizing oil smuggling to transport and fund their operations
4093354 these towns are like home ground for smuggling and were here to ensure it stops
4093355 most people in iraq want to live their lives in a safe and secure environment and if the enemy elements are invading the town the residents are in danger
4093356 when we put a dent in the oil smuggling and insurgency operations we thereby lay a dent in al qaida of iraq
4093357 denying al qaida access to the town will take away the opposition of the citys government and make it more effective
4093358 they were old and we were hearing that they dont want kennels anymore
4093359 the best thing to do was get rid of them
4093360 there are others ways to take care of the situation like in a court

4093367 this meeting was very important as we shift from legislative advocacy to the hard work of implementation
4093368 our wins in the farm bill must be integrated into each agencys work plan as directed by the usda leadership but it wont happen automatically the broader organic community must continue to work together share the workload and present a united front this is essential to our success
4093369 every day our moneyfreedom service hears from people who have found themselves in a downward spiral of debt and one of the factors that contributes towards that is the fact that people are offered credit at every turn
4093370 there are cases where people have focused themselves and freed themselves from debt and have then been offered and taken on store cards and credit cards it is easy to tell yourself that youve changed and that you can manage that youll pay it off immediately every month or that it is an emergency measure but in reality that often doesnt happen
4093371 even if people are unsuccessful in their applications for credit facilities which in the current climate more and more people are the fact that they tried to get credit appears on their credit record and to their detriment we fully support any moves that try to regulate procedures to enable people to remain within a manageable level of debt
4093372 weve got a big problem in britain were addicted to debt and we are seeing the consequences of that as the credit crunch hits and everyone is finding it more and more difficult with the rising cost of living i think the role of the next conservative government is to stop britains addiction to debt and make sure when we next have a financial crisis or economic problem that we are much better prepared than we are at the moment
4093373 im not telling people whether they should take out a store card im just setting out the boundaries to ensure fair play
4093374 we need to take steps now to deal with the current problem and make sure that in future we dont repeat the mistake and let britain become hooked on debt he said
4093375 the iphone is really bringing the internet to a mobile device for the first time you really do have the internet in your pocket
4093376 the benefit of the old landlord was that he was never about
4093377 hi the ceiling has fallen in this is urgent can you send someone to fix it
4093378 hi im standing on the ceiling how is this possible because the ceiling is on the floor
4093379 it is amazing how a creature so fragile can achieve such immeasurable superiority
4093380 i still keep wondering about his birthplace and his birth certificate im still not convinced that he actually was born a natural born citizen
4093381 according to some people who know what theyre talking about who are experts on this they say that the birth certificate that hes got on his website and has been posted to the daily kos and some other places is it looks very much like a photoshop deal and doesnt look legit
4093382 responded and apparently it isnt good enough that he posted his birth certificate
4093383 they say they want it because they claim he is not a citizen of the united states its pretty ridiculous
4093384 berni is a dynamic preacher of gods word with a passion for helping people to connect with god amidst the realities of life he has a wonderful ability to communicate deep life changing truths in a way that makes sense to the rest of us talking about issues that really matter things that each one of us experiences in our own lives
4093385 are they reporting the news or are they taking dictation
4093386 apparently accels the following is the latest editorial posing as a news report from ap in its entirety
4093387 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4093388 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4093389 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
4093390 it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission
4093391 we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
4093392 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
4093393 russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
4093394 on the one hand this could be a way to set up a buffer zone between the separatist regions and on the other it also seems there is an aspect of disbanding the georgian military aspects
4093395 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field
4093396 being an american gives you a passport around the world
4093397 these again are instances of homegrowns who take it to the limit these people wanted to go all the way to iraq
4093398 i am continuing to work to try to bring down the terrorist web sites on the internet
4093399 i think the critical role is reaching out to try to stop the problem in local areas before it starts
4093400 we have a first amendment and we champion the constitution and so in no way shape or form should we engage in censorship of the internet
4093401 its not a substitute for physical field training but it can come close to creating situations on how to train for an urban attack a mall attack
4093402 its somewhat like what some of the 9 11 hijackers used in flight simulation software
4093403 giving parameters as far as race religious views or age groups really misses the point we should be much more sophisticated in the way we approach threats against our country
4093404 investigators arrested them even though they found no guns explosives or targets
4093405 these terrorism acts are trending toward the homegrown self activated self radicalized the sort of thing that could literally pop up in your back yard the typical things we would use to detect terrorism dont work because these people are off the charts so to speak nine times out of ten for the next decade its going to be the local cop who stops the terror attacks
4093406 what are you trying to sell to the local police departments
4093407 would he have succeeded had it not been for the diligence of the jttf
4093408 examine and report upon the facts and causes of violent radicalization homegrown terrorism and ideologically based violence
4093409 build upon and bring together the work of other entities
4093410 the term violent radicalization means the process of adopting or promoting an extremist belief system for the purpose of facilitating ideologically based violence to advance political religious or social change
4093411 law enforcement should focus on action not thought we need to worry about the people who are committing crimes rather than those who harbor beliefs that the government may consider to be extreme
4093412 he went off on a rant against u s foreign policy in the middle east
4093413 we dont ask people for their real names and dont keep track of who attends prayer service
4093414 i dont know why he lied about his real name
4093415 and i dont know why he chose to write down his real name knowing i worked at the berlitz
4093416 i said hold it there what are you talking about
4093417 this 11th hour ruling from the bush administration is highly problematic after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it
4093418 as president senator obama will fight to maintain the strong protections of the endangered species act and undo this proposal from president bush
4093419 in this case it was determined that we needed to move forward in a timely fashion
4093420 i recently received a page from the washington post june 19 2008 page a9
4093421 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
4093422 a poster child of the extremist elitist gun control movement
4093423 to somehow suggest obama is supportive of gun owners because he says so when he is in montana running for president is absurd
4093424 we are going to make sure that anybody that tells montana gun owners that barack obama is not a threat to gun owners is exposed as someone who is not shooting straight
4093425 the nra is wrong to suggest we are misleading anybody
4093426 es un recuerdo para siempre algo hermoso para m y estoy s per contenta de haberlo hecho
4093427 then i turned to see the voice that was speaking to me and on turning i saw seven golden lampstands and in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash around his chest the hairs of his head were white like white wool like snow his eyes were like a flame of fire his feet were like burnished bronze refined in a furnace and his voice was like the roar of many waters in his right hand he held seven stars from his mouth came a sharp two edged sword and his face was like the sun shining in full strength
4093428 a security guard received gunshot injuries after shots were fired by the suspects
4093429 there was also the discharge of a firearm by police
4093430 we are not sure whether it was accidental or intended
4093431 estoy muy metida en el teatro no voy a hacer televisi n
4093432 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties
4093433 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
4093434 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
4093435 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
4093436 it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does after the election in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee
4093437 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
4093438 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4093439 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4093440 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4093441 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
4093442 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee
4093443 we are not per se a clinton support group we are a democratic party get your act together support group
4093444 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
4093445 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
4093446 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
4093447 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
4093448 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
4093449 i led in the abramoff hearings in the in the obscure indian affairs committee for which people are still testifying and going to jail
4093450 mccains decision to cozy up to one of the central figures in the republican culture of corruption
4093451 i take the long view of politics which is that yesterdays opponent can be tomorrows friend or ally
4093452 no position title or official role in the mccain campaign and am not seeking one
4093453 will be coming to atlanta on august 18 for a very special event at the marriott marquis downtown and i have agreed to serve as a member of the mccain victory 2008 team
4093454 if you select to use your credit card you may fax the form to me
4093455 its laughable democrats would try to make this a political issue considering john mccain led the abramoff investigations and has a record of fighting to reform washington
4093456 do you think you might be able to contact karl as i am sure you have more weight there
4093457 talked to rove about this and i think i killed it hes on it keep this between us dont want to raise expectations but i banged on this one hard
4093458 they expressly authorize the fbi to engage in intelligence collection inside the united states
4093459 there was clear eyed and bipartisan recognition after the attacks that we needed to be able and allowed to collect intelligence in the united states
4093460 i have two kids im worried about so i have other priorities
4093461 economics by john mccain support george bush 95 percent of the time keep spending 10 billion a month for the war in iraq while the iraqis sell oil for record prices giving iraq a 79 billion oil surplus and hurting our economy barack obamas plan end the war responsibly better schools no more tax breaks for oil companies barack obama the middle class first
4093462 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
4093463 the high level of violence contributes to a decrease in the number of workers available can increase the amount of time needed to plan and complete capital projects and hinders u s advisers ability to provide the ministries with assistance and monitor capital project performance
4093464 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidant
4093465 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4093466 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4093467 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
4093468 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
4093469 over the past year we have taken part in several fund raising events and we have been delighted with the response
4093470 weve decided to focus on st marys this time because it provides such an important service and relies on voluntary contributions to meet its 4 million running costs every year
4093471 we and other branches of moneyway have raised money for them in the past because it is a cause close to the hearts of some of our team who have been unfortunate enough to have loved ones affected by terrible illnesses
4093472 weve bought a fantastic hamper and we have started selling raffle tickets at just 1 a strip weve been selling around 25 a day so we have set ourselves a target of 1 000 by the time we draw the winning ticket on friday september 19
4093473 the hospice does amazing work in supporting and counselling the families of their patients as well as looking after those in their care
4093474 hundreds of people volunteer to raise funds for the charity and we were determined to do our bit
4093475 we are so grateful for the time and effort that moneyway put into supporting us
4093476 we wouldnt be able to do the jobs we do without peoples ongoing support and getting companies like moneyway behind us is critical to our success
4093477 the company is obviously very dedicated to supporting charities and this money makes a massive contribution to us

4093518 this general evenness and smoothness of sedimentary layers throughout the geologic column is rather odd especially considering the fact that the current weathering rate for the continents of today averages about 6cm thousand years for the continental shelves this means that in less than 10 million years the entire continental shelves of today would be washed into the oceans to be replaced by new underlying materials
4093519 it is obvious that radiometric techniques may not be the absolute dating methods that they are claimed to be age estimates on a given geological stratum by different radiometric methods are often quite different sometimes by hundreds of millions of years there is no absolutely reliable long term radiological clock

4093527 unlike barack obama john mccain understands the importance of traveling throughout pa and hearing the concerns of voters first hand

4093529 salvando las comparaciones en la semana boca perdi contra los suplentes 4 a 1 y despu s el domingo gan por goleada espero que pase lo mismo con nosotros de todos modos en las pr cticas todos queremos andar bien para demostrar que podemos estar el fin de semana pero si las cosas no salen hay que estar tranquilos lo que importa es ganar el domingo nada m s
4093530 en mi juego no cambi nada lo que s se not es que el equipo tuvo mejor funcionamiento en el segundo tiempo con l nea de tres lo importante es que tenemos que buscar la manera en la que el equipo funcione mejor y si es con l nea de tres yo no tengo problemas pero el que tiene que decidir de acuerdo a c mo vea al equipo es el t cnico nosotros nos tenemos que adaptar a lo que l nos pida
4093531 en el primer tiempo jugamos con gast n carabajal como dos volantes m s defensivos y zapata y rosales m s sueltos un poco m s adelante en el segundo con la l nea de tres nos acomodamos mejor en la cancha puede ser porque ya lo hab amos trabajado anteriormente
4093532 este es el primer campeonato que juego en esta categor a pero s que siempre hay alguna sorpresa san mart n mismo sali campe n cuando al principio no era candidato creo que todos los equipos est n a la altura de cualquiera aunque los candidatos al ascenso son los clubes grandes por eso nosotros tenemos que tratar de ascender con uni n tanto los muchachos que ya estaban como los que vinimos ahora sabemos que uni n es un club grande y siempre tiene que ascender as que si hay presi n es una presi n linda porque se pelea por algo importante
4093533 im reading a course by bernie schaeffer is it a waste of time
4093534 at least for now there is a tenuous cease fire in georgia as medvedev called off the dogs reports on four different eu and russian networks indicate sporadic shooting by georgia probably us israeli advisor mercenaries and the russians are returning fire when fired upon
4093535 we are bidding final farewell to the soviet union the ussr will never come back here we urge ukraine and other members of the cis to leave the organization which russia administers
4093536 the european union must be prepared to commit itself including on the ground
4093537 many countries have said that they are ready to join in
4093538 we are encouraged by what we saw this morning but we have to go through the united nations
4093539 you call it peacekeeping troops i dont call it that but controllers monitors european facilitators i think the russians would accept that
4093540 im convinced at the end of the day we will find an international peacekeeping force in the region with the eu at its heart
4093541 there are no signs of the russians letting in anyone else i dont really see it happening at the moment the russians are firmly in control
4093542 i do not think we should get lost today in long discussions about responsibility or who caused the escalation of the last few days
4093543 the european union will want to consider how it proceeds with the partnership and cooperation agreement
4093544 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki a russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
4093545 the principal element the respect of teritorial integrity of georgia is missing
4093546 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4093547 it is clear that georgia wants this dispute to become something more than a short if bloody conflict in the region
4093548 in the days ahead we will use us aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
4093549 the united states strongly supports frances efforts as president of the european union to broker an agreement to end this conflict
4093550 stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4093551 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4093552 the eu must be ready to engage including on the ground to support all efforts including those of the united nations and the osce for a lasting and peaceful settlement of the conflicts in georgia
4093553 the russian troops are destroying the city of gori they are mining the city they are destroying everything in poti port they are destroying the newly built roads in western georgia
4093554 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4093555 only served to deepen the isolation into which russia is moving
4093556 very strong growing sense that russia is not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said that it wants to be
4093557 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia
4093558 we would like to underline that the representatives of international and humanitarian organisations have not been granted an access in the territories controlled by the russian armed forces
4093559 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose
4093560 only western peacekeepers can end the war i have staked my countrys fate on the wests rhetoric about democracy and liberty
4093561 russias invasion of georgia strikes at the heart of western values and our 21st century system of security
4093562 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4093563 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4093564 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
4093565 you go to school in this country until you are 16 at least in other parts of the world thats not the case
4093566 it was nice to feel when i got to the top that i had really earned it and done something to help those girls in africa
4093567 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates

4093581 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4093582 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4093606 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4093607 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4093608 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4093713 half the earths forests have been logged and only one fifth of old growth forests remain intact
4093714 cheap grace is the deadly enemy of our church we are fighting today for costly grace
4093715 cheap grace means grace sold on the market like cheapjacks wares the sacraments the forgiveness of sin and the consolations of religion are thrown away at cut prices cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance baptism without church discipline communion without confession absolution without personal confession cheap grace is grace without discipleship grace without the cross grace without jesus christ living and incarnate

4093724 i am again in the anguish of childbirth until christ is formed in you
4093725 those god foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son
4093726 and we are being transformed into the same image of christ from one degree of glory to another
4093727 do not transform us grace transforms us they are gods multifaceted means of grace in the material world of human interaction conduits of love that enliven our witness and that imbue us with the grace that makes holy passion possible spiritual disciplines are trail signs left by generations of christians who have gone before us that point the way to the cross reminders that in dying to self there is new life assurance that in leaping into the chasm that separates us from god we will find god they are as life changing as easter and as ordinary as dixie cups by the sink in the middle of the night small useful yet by themselves insignificant containers god gives us so we may drink living water and so we may carry it to others
4093728 along with god richard foster points to this reformational truth when he writes that
4093729 when martin luther gave us his revolutionary teaching about the priesthood of all believers he was referring not just to the fact that the plowboy and the milkmaid could do priestly or liturgical work but that the plowing and the milking themselves were priestly work

4093761 gila ini gosip ajaib banget padahal mereka dua duanya sahabat gue kebetulan memang sudah lama nggak ketemu kok tiba tiba ada gosip itu
4093762 with the recent first shipments to the u s of our exciting new coco convertible we have turned a new page in kandis development in relatively short order we expect that the manufacturing and sales of super mini autos will become our largest business bringing a new growth dimension to the company
4093763 we continue to believe that barring any delays in production or shipping strong consumer interest in our off highway super minis will translate to sales of the new coco convertible in a range of 5 000 to 10 000 vehicles before year end and at a sales price to kandi of approximately 4 000 per vehicle upon delivery this should translate to a contribution of at least 20 million in new revenues to second half and full year results
4093764 given anticipated margins on these sales of up to 30 we expect that overall gross margins in 2008 will exceed the margins achieved last year of 21 5
4093765 we expect continuing growth in our atrv sales in a range of 10 to 20 with a continued concentration on building fewer overall units of more high end vehicles which offer higher margins in this regard we expect to see a boost in sales from our two new utv models for agricultural use
4093766 we have not yet factored into our guidance an anticipated contribution from our newest product line the tt three wheeled motorcycle which offers higher levels of safety and superb mileage with its expected launch in the current quarter it has already generated considerable excitement from our distributors who have seen a dramatic climb in motorcycle imports over the past year
4093767 we fully expect dramatic increases in the sales of our super minis to u s consumers hungry for more exciting fuel efficient cars especially as we add electric powered and gas powered hard tops to the line in the not too distant future
4093768 the current state of lending affairs in america shows the desperate need for increased financial literacy across our nation especially people who live in underserved communities
4093769 the data we released today proves financial empowerment programs can make a difference particularly in light of the growing mortgage subprime crisis and credit crisis results such as these show how higher credit scores can equal a lower cost of funds for everyone from the poor to the middle class and we are pleased that operation hope is able to help affect positive changes through our financial empowerment programs

4093772 we were able to assess the situation and work with her to help her become a homeowner once again by assisting her in building a budget that would help to improve her credit score that we were able to help annette achieve her goal of homeownership and really affect positive change in her life is all a part of our mission to give people a hand up not just a hand out

4093786 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4093787 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4093788 el 4 de agosto de 2007 daniel uzc tegui removi dinero de los aproximadamente 800 000 d lares que fueron decomisados en buenos aires

4093792 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4093793 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4093794 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4093795 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4093796 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4093797 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4093798 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4093799 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4093800 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4093804 what weve found is that tracking debunking and pushing back all go together and there is no way to be successful without a strong activist community working on all aspects of it in fact an activist community is really the only way to push back on these lies there are nasty ads viral emails robocalls and dishonest direct mail pieces all working together to push a negative and nasty theme from the right and only the combined effort of active americans can be successful pushing back at this well funded machine

4093816 were going to share some ideas on how to move the process forward
4093817 that would also create ground for us to return to the negotiating table
4093818 for tom with our love always mum dad andy maxine and all who love you xx
4093819 tom was an experienced scout so its a mystery why this happened
4093820 he had been in the scout movement since he was six and had been hiking in mountainous areas since he was 13 we think he slipped and fell
4093821 were a very close knit family and its the worst thing that could have happened
4093822 but we had to bear in mind that when he went off on these adventures we knew there was a possibility this could happen
4093823 but we know from texts and photos that he was having the time of his life
4093824 tom was the friendliest most outgoing person you could meet he knew lots of people and was into so much
4093825 he was passionately green and into recycling and although he could drive he would cycle everywhere
4093826 he also stood for the green party here in the may local elections representing pin green and martins wood and he was hoping he would become an mp for the green party
4093827 he had a fantastic future ahead of him and was planning on going to mongolia china and russia next year
4093828 tom has achieved everything he set out to do and would have gone on to achieve so much more
4093829 this is absolutely heartbreaking for his family and many friends
4093830 all our thoughts are with toms family at this sad time
4093831 mold is a common occurrence and it indicates healthy soil i understand its not ideal so we recommend adding more sawdust and baking soda to dry out the compost make sure the unit is heating up and add less green items

4093836 the strategic investments weve made across emea are rapidly paying off

4093851 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4093852 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

4093900 we just want to develope a crime free society and it needs to build by the future generation but the recent globalisation and the electronic boom is giving our children toys and games with violence as an ingredient for thrill but we feel that its somehow influencing the future boys and girls to grow a violent attitude also thats why today the rally is to set a new trend against those violent toys and to build a children force who can identify their future in harmony but not in violence
4093901 its indeed a new way of tackling problems and hope it will work suitably a child grows with its toys and learn from them and the latest toys with violence can made a worst effect on the children our children should be given a better atmosphere to grow to peace and to lead the future in a proper direction
4093902 i dont need no stinkin benchmark because i only use index funds so my portfolio is the benchmark
4093903 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4093904 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4093905 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
4093906 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4093907 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration
4093908 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4093909 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4093910 i understand immediately that life back home was probably very tough and i understand that you probably wanted to do the best for you and for your young family
4093911 you engaged unlawfully in a very well organised and sophisticated business importing and selling fake trainers
4093912 whether the people who bought them knew they were fake or believed they were genuine one cannot say but what one can say is that they would never have been of the quality of the genuine article
4093913 you came here illegally and what you have done over the last few months has effectively deceived everybody and that cannot be tolerated
4093914 im afraid it seems to me that a message must go out that the courts will not tolerate this sort of activity from anybody
4093915 you were warned in your interview last year and rather than stop you seem to have doubled your activity and that is a serious aggravating factor
4093916 its a very good sentence it reflects the severity and the size of the investigation
4093917 i hope that this sends a clear message to others who think that they can make a quick buck from selling counterfeit goods
4093918 the court took into consideration that he knew what he was doing was illegal back in 2007
4093919 rather than scale down his operation he in fact increased his business

4093922 the first week it takes bus drivers a little bit longer to run the routes because they are looking for students not familiar with the bus stops
4093923 if the bus is not there then go head and take them to school if the parents can
4093924 well make sure that they were at the right stop and right time and well fix any problems for the next morning
4093925 we are trying to prevent kindergartners from getting on a bus and not knowing where they are suppose to get off
4093926 this is important because a young child may know where they live but if you ask the child what bus stop they arent going to know

4093929 we are pleased to see the continued growth of rooms to our portfolio and believe this is another validation of our commitment to providing better technology and better service to hoteliers perhaps as important as adding new customers and rooms is the fact that we have done such a great job maintaining these relationships year in and year out the hospitality services industry is extremely competitive and we understand that our hotel customers rely on us to ensure that their guests receive truly world class service
4093930 we are also continuing development on our media distribution system which will be the catalyst to addressing the gowning need for a revenue model that will address the high speed internet total cost of ownership for the hospitality industry

4093933 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
4093934 its the same sentence as in 2000 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california yet the issue that will be put before voters nov 4 is radically different this time the wording would be used to rescind an existing constitutional right to marry we fervently hope that voters whatever their personal or religious convictions will shudder at such a step and vote no on proposition 8
4093935 the state of same sex marriage shifted in may when the california supreme court overturned proposition 22 the ban on gay marriage that voters approved eight years ago and ruled that marriage was a fundamental right under the state constitution
4093936 what voters must consider about proposition 8 is that unlike proposition 22 this is no longer about refining existing california law in the wake of the courts ruling the only way to deny marriage to gay and lesbian couples is by revising constitutional rights themselves proposition 8 seeks to embed wording in the constitution that would eliminate the fundamental right to same sex marriage
4093937 our increasing tendency to speak of what is most important to us in terms of rights and to frame nearly every social controversy as a clash of rights
4093938 the most distinctive features of our american rights dialect are the very ones that are most conspicuously in tension with what we require in order to give a reasonably full and coherent account of what kind of society we are and what kind of polity we are trying to create its penchant for absolute extravagant formulations its near aphasia concerning responsibility its excessive homage to individual independence and self sufficiency its habitual concentration on the individual and the state at the expense of the intermediate groups of civil society and its unapologetic insularity not only does each of these traits make it difficult to give voice to common sense or moral intuitions they also impede development of the sort of rational political discourse that is appropriate to the needs of a mature complex liberal pluralistic development

4093989 in tv studios it is a lot more antiseptic i love the freedom of stepping on stage

4094002 it is imperative that we gain rapid access to south ossetia so that we can bring urgent help to those in need
4094003 but of course we hope that situation changes in the coming hours
4094004 south ossetia is generally off limits for humanitarian workers at this stage

4094006 the most recent common ancestor of all extant members of x and all its descendants
4094007 bubodens rivals repenomamus the largest stagodontids and the taeniodont schowalteria in size and is therefore among the largest mesozoic mammals
4094008 remember also that most multis had plagiaulacoid dentition and some therian marsupial animals with similar teeth have grown up to the size of a leopard i e propleopus there are sightings of propleopus like cryptids in the usa especially in the appalachians but i think they are most likely the result of celtic imagination or inspired by homemade whisky
4094009 david if taeniodonts were present in the cretaceous why are they absent in spec
4094010 twice as large as the other mammaliforms and crown group mammals perhaps but twice as large as all of the other mesozoic eucynodonts i mean twice as large as the largest traversodontids they were eucynodonts too exaeretodon had a skull that was up to 40 cm long are we really talking about a taeniodont with an 80cm long skull
4094011 the cancridonts are eiter whale or seal like marine animals or mole like burrowers their limbs are far to specialised for swimming and or burrowing to give them a parasagittal gait when moving on land the largest and most whale like of the cancridonts are fully aquatic and unable to move on land anyway
4094012 ive never understood why there should be monotremes with a parasaggital gait we dont really need that
4094013 it does not help of course that we havent created most of australias mammal fauna yet in the first place we havent even decided on whether to have marsupials there
4094014 id love to be able to hold the south african flag up high there it would be fantastic to come away with a medal south africa is struggling a bit at these games

4094020 id love to walk away with a medal but in all reality nothing is written in stone

4094030 rather than inserting the structure into the canopy of a single tree the structure is designed to attach itself to three trees thereby directly securing three trees per structure from logging furthermore the surrounding trees will pose a threat to the structure if felled therefore a small number of structures can secure the well being of a large area of pristine wilderness
4094031 the styx valley forest is a pristine wilderness in south western tasmania it is home to the tallest hardwood trees in the world averaging over 80 metres it is a unique ecosystem unlike any other many of the trees are over 400 years old in 1996 only around 13 of these trees remain a large area of south western tasmanias pristine wilderness is world heritage and is therefore protected unfortunately the styx valley falls just outside the south west national park and it is now under attack from logging companies the logging companies clear fell such areas in tasmania and burn any remnant vegetation once they have removed any timber considered of value the high quality timbers that are then removed are reduced to nothing more than wood chips that are then exported mainly to japan from this rape and pillage of tasmanias previously untouched pristine landscape tasmania receives only aud 10 per ton of woodchips
4094032 i didnt mean to disturb you grandma but you were just sitting here staring at your hands and i wanted to make sure you were ok
4094033 stop and think for a moment about the hands you have how they have served you well throughout your years these hands though wrinkled shriveled and weak have been the tools i have used all my life to reach out and grab and embrace life they braced and caught my fall when as a toddler i crashed upon the floor they put food in my mouth and clothes on my back as a child my mother taught me to fold them in prayer they tied my shoes and pulled on my boots they held my husband and wiped my tears when he went off to serve our country in time of war they have been dirty scraped and raw swollen and bent they were uneasy and clumsy when i tried to hold my newborn son the left hand is decorated with my wedding band they showed the world that i was married and loved someone special they wrote my letters to him and trembled and shook when i buried my parents and my spouse they have held my children and grandchildren consoled neighbors and shook in fists of anger when i didnt understand they have covered my face combed my hair and washed and cleansed the rest of my body they have been sticky and wet bent and broken dried and raw and to this day when not much of anything else of me works real well but these hands hold me up lay me down and again continue to fold in prayer these hands are the mark of where ive been and the ruggedness of life but more importantly it will be these hands that god will reach out and take when he leads me home and with my hands he will lift me to his side and there i will use these hands to touch his face

4094079 hey this message is important enough to interrupt you with
4094080 it is its fibre nearly and inch and a half long that gives egyptian cotton its peculiar value the magical fecundity of the nile soil permits the harvesting of a crop averaging 500 pounds to the acre twice what other planters get
4094081 cotton egypt produces irrigation the secret of its successful culture
4094082 the soil and climate are so perfectly adapted to cotton raising that it is the governing crop and brings enough money to the country to indirectly pay the interest on the enormous debt
4094083 eight or ten years ago egypt was insolvent today she is bristling with prosperity i cant help thinking that cotton or the money it produces has played a part of no small importance
4094084 egyptian cotton still commands over one third of the world market for long staple and extra long staple cotton and is egypts most lucrative export commodity after oil
4094085 reforms being made by the current government administration are laying the foundations for a newly dynamic and efficient industrial sector

4094116 en teor a es un sistema de precios libres pero en realidad es de precios administrados me da la impresi n de que lo que hubo hasta ahora fue una suba consentida por el gobierno
4094117 creo que muy lejos no debemos estar es posible que por ah falten un par de puntos m s de suba pero no mucho
4094118 la nafta ha alcanzado el punto de equilibrio teniendo en cuenta el precio del barril que tenemos en la argentina por las retenciones el productor recibe entre 42 y 47 d lares pero lo que est n haciendo las petroleras es tratar de compensar los problemas que tienen con el gasoil que deben importar a p rdida carg ndoselo a las naftas cuyos consumidores est n menos ligados al sector productivo

4094122 j rgen hat viel auf den kopf gestellt jetzt m ssen aber auch die ergebnisse stimmen sonst n tzen die ver nderungen und investitionen nichts
4094123 ich werde beweisen dass bayern und ich zusammenpassen dass wir erfolg haben werden davon bin ich zu 100 prozent berzeugt
4094124 dass wir die notwendige geduld aufbringen m ssen bis die dinge auch richtig greifen
4094125 es wird so genommen wie es ist wir machen das beste daraus die mannschaft ist gut genug um erfolgreich in die saison zu starten
4094126 dass wir gegen den hsv die laufwege machen m ssen
4094127 unsere mannschaft macht k rperlich und mental einen guten eindurck wir fahren selbstbewusst nach m nchen
4094128 der hsv hat dort noch nicht verloren ich hoffe dass es so bleibt
4094129 nat rlich k nnen wir nicht aus dem vollen sch pfen aber ich bin nicht unruhig die mannschaft die einl uft kann jeden schlagen
4094130 wenn alle so an die arbeit herangehen wie j rgen haben wir in dieser saison viel spa
4094131 i think many of our problems as a country would be solved if people had thick passports theres just no substitute for actually going and seeing things
4094132 winning here is really important to me in a whole lot of ways
4094133 i know the track like the back of my hand and coming off the back of a major result at oulton park in the last round im fired up and ready to go
4094134 weve been getting better all year and now were getting some reliability too were starting to knock tenths off my lap times
4094135 none of us can wait well all have our families there and as long as i can drive well and not have any gremlins im sure we can have some good results
4094136 its nice to be back but dont forget i have been at home for seven months
4094137 to get in the car and be right up to speed is going to be really difficult the car is good and the set up i have is very nice im really happy with the car but its not going to be an easy event
4094138 its germany its going to rain tomorrow morning you know that
4094139 i dont know so much about what the car will do in the rain thats going to be completely new for me
4094140 im sure there will be a lot of mud in every corner when the rains coming so running further back on the road where i am its going to be harder than being at the front
4094141 but its not a massive change from the last one just some things in the engine
4094142 we will decide on the action to be taken after we study the findings of the inquiry
4094143 i want to clarify several news reports that the teacher was either promoted or moved to a school nearer her home the move is just a temporary measure while we investigate the matter
4094144 los mercados han comenzado a preguntarse si el pa s podr a estar al borde de otro default pocos participantes del mercado si es que alguno han olvidado los costos y el drama asociados al default anterior como resultado los mercados est n altamente sensibilizados
4094145 la argentina parece deslizarse r pidamente hacia una posici n desfavorable con costos prohibitivos de financiamiento en momentos en que el fondeo es cada vez m s escaso sin embargo estimamos toda reestructuraci n potencial de la deuda improbable hasta 2010
4094146 las preocupaciones sobre una reestructuraci n de la deuda en el corto plazo parecen exageradas
4094147 mirando hacia adelante la pregunta es ser capaz el gobierno de continuar explotando sus ahorros en 2010 los mercados parecen ser cada vez m s de la opini n de que no
4094148 no vemos la recompra de bonos como un indicio de un cambio fundamental en la pol tica econ mica
4094149 la inflaci n el robusto crecimiento y los altos precios de las commodities
4094150 impacto negativo del retroceso reciente en los precios de las commodities agr colas en las cuentas fiscales y en el desempe o de la econom a real
4094151 es bastante parad jico que un pa s con super vits fiscales gemelos que a n crece a tasas s lidas y cuyas principales exportaciones han tenido un aumento significativo de los precios desde 2003 a n carece de un acceso directo a los mercados y tiene que pagar un 15 para colocar deuda
4094152 ya no es una cuesti n de si los kirchner ser n derrocados sino de cu ndo lo ser n
4094153 dada la intransigencia de los kirchner s lo es una cuesti n de tiempo para que sean echados
4094154 desafortunadamente los cambios abruptos de poder en la argentina tienden a ser ca ticos esa es la raz n por la cual los mercados anticipan un default aun cuando los indicadores macroecon micos del pa s son consistentes
4094155 esta es una pel cula que ya conocimos bien es muy dif cil que un gobierno que pierde la confianza de la sociedad pueda recuperarla
4094156 la situaci n es bastante mala y dado el camino que transitan los kirchner esto terminar mal ya que desde sus tiempos en santa cruz ellos no cambian de rumbo cuando eso puede ser visto como una se al de debilidad
4094157 no esta vez creo que yo los sigo a ellos que hace tiempo que recomiendan salirse de la argentina
4094158 ellos no hablan de un colapso pol tico pero lo piensan

4094169 anviron is a company that has grown over the last fiscal year at a rapid rate closing our fye 2008 in june with gross sales of over 23 7 million and posting record sales in july of over 5 million
4094170 we are also pleased to announce that we are now projecting sales in excess of 4 3 million for august putting our company on pace to surpass its budgeted first quarter earning figures of 6 9 million by more than double
4094171 as our management team continues to focus on our expanding business endeavors we are appreciative of the attention our company is beginning to receive in the public market as demonstrated by mr larry oakleys profile on his website http www wallstreetcorner com
4094172 this type of industry support certainly bolsters our belief that the time for the us bx is now
4094173 we are excited with the building momentum and look forward to announcing more developments in this important project

4094176 we cannot continue with the situation where hostilities are likely we must bring them to an end by having a permanent solution to this problem
4094177 what we must do now is ensure that its a lasting ceasefire and that there is humanitarian aid which we are prepared to provide for those who are casualties of what has been a terrible set of events
4094178 its also important and we are prepared to contribute to this that there is humanitarian aid for the people who have been displaced and for the cities and towns that have been brought into danger

4094182 musharraf has been one of the bush administrations closest allies while washington would prefer not to host his exile as it would look bad politically it would if he has nowhere else to go his son lives in the us
4094183 rumours that musharraf is set to quit have been circulating in pakistan for several days
4094184 the provincial votes were symbolic but the formal process will begin early next week with an impeachment motion in the national parliament it is clear that the ruling coalition now has the two thirds majority needed to impeach him government insiders said that if musharraf wants to quit he must do so before the impeachment proceedings begin leaving him with only a few days his spokesman has rebutted any suggestion that he will step down

4094193 losing michael is a big blow and he is upset about that as much as anyone he is a quality player with a quality finish as he proved on tuesday
4094194 he did miss another chance but if we get a ration of one goals for every two chances then there is always a goal in him
4094195 i have looked at the option of bringing in a striker on loan over the last 24 hours but i also have to look at the situation i have here with our own squad
4094196 troy deeney came on as a substitute on tuesday to play up front and alex nicholls has played in that position before he has pace and an eye for goal and of course ishmel demontagnac also has experience of playing up front
4094197 he rarely scores simple goals for us they are always screamers and he will also be under consideration
4094198 mattis will be joining in with us today but we have to be aware that he has not kicked a ball in anger for a couple of days
4094199 he was on the bench on tuesday but he is obviously in my thoughts because of his experience

4094207 tonys a great competitor in a great many ways because hes tough but hes also respectful
4094208 hes been a good friend on and off the racetrack specifically off hes done a lot to help me and guide me hes an indiana boy so i have a different respect for him because of that but in general hes just a hard nosed racer and ive always appreciated him for that whether we argue on the racetrack or not were two hard nosed racers
4094209 herr schmidt war ein engagierter mitarbeiter der bereit war auch zus tzliche arbeiten zu bernehmen
4094210 als je thuiskomt en je vindt die lappen dan geeft je dat niet echt een rustig gemoed
4094211 ik was op dienstreis als zij werd gebeld bleef het stil en ontstond er een dreigende stilte of er werd gezegd die man van jou krijgen we nog wel
4094212 de politieke inbraak was al onacceptabel dat paste en past volstrekt niet in het democratisch zo goed geordende nederland en dan ook nog een keer ambtenaren in het zonnetje zetten het was een enorme inbreuk op ons priv leven het was ongehoord
4094213 ik trof een hevig ontstelde secretaresse aan ze hadden onder meer het brievenboek meegenomen en ministerraadstukken wij wisten meteen dat hier stennis van zou komen
4094214 ik was destijds vrij bekend door spreekbeurten over kernenergie door de naambordjes op het ministerie was mijn kamer gemakkelijk te vinden ze namen ook een kantooragenda mee waarin de vakanties van mij en collegas stond vermeld dat hebben ze er toen ook bij gepubliceerd
4094215 nee we wilden er niet meer ruchtbaarheid aan geven dan noodzakelijk na de brandstichting is er volgens mij wel serieus werk van gemaakt ik heb toen alles in handen gegeven van de beveiligingsdienst van het ministerie media hadden er destijds weinig aandacht voor wel voor de ontvreemde documenten e n voorval vond ik tekenend voor die tijd bij een inspraakbijeenkomst heb ik een keer een glas water in mijn gezicht gegooid gekregen de volkskrant schreef de volgende morgen dat de watergooier was gestruikeld en met machtsvertoon de zaal was uitgezet dat was echt niet zo
4094216 onzin er was niet sprake van een geheim plan wij waren gewoon bezig met het bekijken van locaties voor mogelijke nieuwe kerncentrales de documenten gingen onder meer over bestuurlijke afspraken met noord brabant en limburg indien er ook gekozen zou worden voor moerdijk deze zouden in werking treden na goedkeuring van de tweede kamer het was een volstrekte normale gang van zaken
4094217 kernenergie was natuurlijk een gevoelig thema cda fractievoorzitter bert de vries stuurde van aardenne toen ook een scherpe brief ik heb daarna van aardenne geholpen met beantwoordingsbrief aan de vries daarin werd uitgelegd dat er van misleiding van de tweede kamer op geen enkele manier sprake was dat er gewoon sprake was van bestuurlijk overleg niet meer en niet minder toen was de politieke gevoeligheid er af
4094218 nee er is eigenlijk maar n reden waarom dat niet is gebeurd de kernramp in tsjernobyl in 1986 de tweede kamer zou zonder deze ramp een dag of vijf later hebben beslist over de voortgang van het kernenergieprogramma bij ez dachten we dat we groen licht zouden krijgen de elektriciteitssector stond startklaar
4094219 hij heeft niet alleen een politieke inbraak gepleegd maar ook geterroriseerd en op de man gespeeld en hij is pas met zijn onthulling gekomen nadat het misdrijf verjaard is maar hij heeft me inmiddels gebeld en gemaild we gaan elkaar een keer ontmoeten hij heeft zijn excuses aangeboden dat waarderen mijn vrouw en ik zeer
4094220 ik heb spijt van deze publicaties en vooral van het bekendmaken van adressenlijsten van ambtenaren ik heb hiervoor de heer verberg in een brief mijn excuses aangeboden
4094221 ik heb na 1988 afstand genomen van dit soort actiemethodes ik heb in 1996 in
4094222 it was not intentional he was supposed to pull away the bustier and leave the red lace bra
4094223 this is a question of our honor come out of your homes
4094224 i strongly condemn the human rights violation and the suppression on these oppressed people
4094225 to call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mind set that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past
4094226 this matter of kashmir is not indias internal affair it is as much a matter for pakistan as it is for kashmiris
4094227 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4094228 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4094229 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4094230 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us

4094238 toddler 411 clear answers amp smart advice for your toddler
4094239 im so excited i think were going to surprise some people theres focus and an intensity when youre out there that is unparalleled since ive been here
4094240 i think its almost like a breath of fresh air for him a new start
4094241 it became so stressful for him last year that to have a new beginning and to have a new start to the season is a breath of fresh air its an opportunity to try to put last year behind him
4094242 the whole reason he came back to play was because he is a warrior
4094243 hes tough thats what gets overlooked some times i dont know that people really gave him that respect of trying to play through pain its disappointing the season turned out the way it did and most of it fell on his shoulders
4094244 he has had so many ups and downs and hes handled them all so well he was getting blamed last year for things that werent his fault he would throw an interception but it would be a tackle letting him get hit or the receiver running the wrong route but he shows up every day ready to work very composed he never looks rattled
4094245 its tough but we just got our american record by four seconds
4094246 i think shes enjoying things more after winning the 100 backstroke
4094247 she and i process information the same way if you go through it and have an idea of how it works and what to expect its easier im just proud of how shes managing her number of events and her responsibilities you only get that with experience
4094248 its disappointing if both americans dont make the top eight that competitiveness look how difficult it is to be on the relays
4094249 otherwise i might end up with half the teams going up my leg he said
4094250 rather than trying to tear the ball to shreds every time i swung at it
4094251 i think i was fighting against the odds nedney said
4094252 all of the coaches were saying your feet are too big youre too tall
4094253 they likened it to a guy swinging an elongated golf club its much more difficult to make contact with a longer club
4094254 then i went to the arizona cardinals baltimore ravens oakland raiders denver broncos carolina panthers tennessee titans san francisco 49ers
4094255 early in my career we didnt have many or any assets or children or anything like that we could just up and move nedney said
4094256 you can get down on yourself when youre cut so many times but i always looked at it as what a great experience im traveling around the country playing in different stadiums wearing a lot of different jerseys and meeting a lot of friends
4094257 before i signed with san francisco one of my fears was what if i dont play well
4094258 this is where i live the last thing i wanted was for fans to walk around and say hey theres joe nedney hes terrible
4094259 i always wanted to play well and leave a good taste in the fans mouths i dont want to get run out of town
4094260 the world has enough women who are tough we need women who are tender there are enough women who are coarse we need women who are kind there are enough women who are rude we need women who are refined we have enough women of fame and fortune we need more women of faith we have enough greed we need more goodness we have enough vanity we need more virtue we have enough popularity we need more purity
4094261 movie fans in australia and new zealand can choose from a great selection of over 700 films for purchase and rent on the itunes store
4094262 itunes provides an incredibly easy and fun way for people to discover and enjoy movies and has quickly become the worlds most popular online movie store with customers renting and purchasing over 50 000 movies everyday
4094263 if you can make it through the training camp the hard part is done
4094264 so its kind of like why make it through training camp and stop now you made it through the hard part the fun part is about to start im looking forward to that and hopefully being a part of the turnaround that we can have this year
4094265 ive been very critical of javon throughout this camp and throughout the off season
4094266 but hes had a string right here of the best practices hes had he looks to be in the right frame of mind lately so if we can continue to work on that and push that its going in a positive direction
4094267 im finally putting everything together as far as what they want and how they want it to be done
4094268 now i can start adding my twist to it and going out and playing football
4094269 im just looking forward to these games and getting out there and doing it
4094270 its kind of like mr davis said he wanted me on his side because i had a lot of success against the raiders every time playing them so im just happy to be on this side and do it against somebody else
4094271 the only thing that we know for sure is that it is a bruise
4094272 its a bruise with a possible sprain so weve got to make sure its not broken
4094273 my main thing is even if its broken it doesnt mean anything
4094274 if i can go out there and play then i can go out there and play if something hurts something hurts i got to try to get to the bottom of it
4094275 if he doesnt play super mario would start for us

4094278 cannot be used because it requires mac os x 10 4 8 or later
4094279 we are pleased to have him on board it was one of the easier deals we have done
4094280 he will come here learn his trade and hopefully we can improve him he has pace which is a tremendous asset and it will certainly give us an option
4094281 j p has played a lot of games and offers a lot to the side whereas mark has the raw ingredients but is just starting out in the professional game
4094282 we need to spend time with him out on the training ground and improve his game
4094283 now is the time to look at moving one or two on who may not be involved in the first team picture
4094284 we had an option to make the deal permanent at any stage so i spoke to him and asked him if he would be happy to stay
4094285 people need to kind of miss us because there was a point in the last two and a half years where you could have seen us at least once a month if you wanted
4094286 its hard to say at this point but musically how black parade tapped into the glam classic rock of queen and ziggy stardust this taps into something different not punk but maybe in its proto sense
4094287 the aesthetic it is extremely different and it is more stripped down too when we get a chance were going to get together and do some demos and start rolling
4094288 they should have known because evidence was available to anyone who cared to ask eyeball or cross reference
4094289 finally theres a big market again for high end games that doesnt require players to blast everything in sight with a rail gun
4094290 were setting sail on a new and far more ambitious course in the sea of interactive games we feel very lucky to have mike bilder at the helm and by helm i actually mean desk were not really on a ship just a regular company in a building and everything

4094292 have you noticed on cheers that the producers made a mistake with sams uniform when he pitched against dutch kincade at yankee stadium they had him wearing a home red sox jersey and they had kevin mchale in road greens after a home game in the boston garden just something i noticed
4094293 the card arrived thursday morning in plenty of time for our gift exchange thursday evening after our rehearsal he was really excited and the card looks perfect i cant tell you how much i appreciate he rush you put on it to get it to me on time
4094294 the referee is holding the down box the predecessor of the sideline stake that shows the number of the down and the yard line of the snap each of the four sides of the box has a number 1 2 3 or 4 and the number facing the field is that of the down officiating mechanics have long since moved the box which is what officials usually call it even though no one has used an actual box in probably 40 years off the field

4094309 i felt quite comfortable i decided to go out hard in the first 500m because my experience of these south american and spanish rowers is that they are all over you if you dont get a good start
4094310 i lost 2kg in 45 minutes training the other day it has been quite tough
4094311 we took a huge step up here today this is going to be very good for shaun he has been taking the pressure fantastically there have been times when he has even been picking me up well have the race of our lives in the final
4094312 this time they only left a wake for us to deal with
4094313 i think its a well made picture but while its funny in spots its very english
4094314 i dont think its broadly commercial it feels like a film that deserves a spirited release but not a wide one joel silver the producer has an 800 screen deal which well honour but we might not be willing to spend the marketing money he wants us to

4094321 you get to see all the top athletes such as michael phelps and all the other top swimmers like kirsty coventry
4094322 for me the dream is now here and i need to do my very best
4094323 weve heard from the rowers that the temperature fluctuates but i think its just about being as ready as possible at the moment my training is going extremely well compared with what i have done in the past for the world championships i basically had four weeks of hard preparation but getting to here i have had about three months so ive finished three or four cycles of training
4094324 but there basically wasnt a decent venue to train in at home so we decided to go to the training camp at daegu we only decided to go to daegu three days before the team left but it was an altitude training camp and the water temperature was good
4094325 its not that important in pool swimming but it is important in long distance swimming
4094326 now its a case of just getting out there to race i am extremely nervous its a week to go so i am just going to have to keep my head together and be positive
4094327 i felt just great in the swim last night i felt a little sore and stiff today i felt so much better ive taken every step so far and im in the final of whats probably the premier race of these games and im just happy to be a part of it
4094328 sagte er vor dem spiel gegen den deutschen meister 2007
4094329 no me fijo en la edad sino en el rendimiento
4094330 no me fijo mucho en la edad sino en el rendimiento tenemos a medio plazo la copa confederaciones y a largo el plazo el mundial hay una fase de clasificaci n importante con escaso margen de error y debemos partir con la mentalidad adecuada para no tener ning n problema nadie en espa a de los jugadores que vayan destacando va a tener las puertas cerradas
4094331 ra l es un jugador que est en la misma situaci n de muchos en absoluto tiene las puertas cerradas de la selecci n aunque en este momento hemos decidido no traerlo

4094336 the people that are pulling mccains strings are the people who want to push us into a new cold war with the russians and ironically and a bit improbably with the chinese too
4094337 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
4094338 yes i am taiwanese theyre chinese why what are you
4094339 the university of toronto has partnered with ibm to become one of the worlds premier computational research institutions a collaboration that will attract researchers from around the world
4094340 scinet will have one of the best facilities in the world that will allow canadian physicists to participate in the adventure of the large hadron collider
4094341 this research may change our view of matter and the universe
4094342 a system this complex could only be designed by bringing together the best minds from the university of toronto and ibm
4094343 this is a tremendous example of public and private collaboration that will benefit the canadian research community for many years to come
4094344 its not the first research to show a correlation between talent management and financial results
4094345 but its one in a handful and i think it really adds to that body of evidence that is helping organizations to build a solid business case for investments in talent management
4094346 smaller competitors who havent done this work really scramble in a lot of cases when it comes to filling holes in their workforce
4094347 youre too small to do it by yourself but perhaps havent built the infrastructure or managerial focus
4094348 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4094349 even as more details are awaited prima facie all the concerns of the defence forces appear to have been suitably addressed the increase in military service pay of pbors personnel below officer rank and compensation for middle rung officers is particularly heartening
4094350 at first instance it seems that all the demands of the defence forces have been addressed but things would be more clear once the finer details are known
4094351 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4094352 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4094353 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4094354 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4094355 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4094356 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4094357 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4094358 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4094359 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4094360 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4094361 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4094362 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4094363 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4094364 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4094365 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4094366 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4094367 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4094368 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4094369 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4094370 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4094371 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4094372 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4094373 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4094374 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4094375 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4094376 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4094377 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4094378 i was so calm that i think i could have seen each face in this venue
4094379 i felt tired before the competition but after it i feel relaxed
4094380 silly spanish basketball team look at what they are doing
4094381 to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing
4094382 we thought it was something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as somewhat loving
4094383 nevertheless some of the european media did not see it this way
4094384 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head during something that is supposed to be a time of world unity
4094385 as asian pacific americans support u s olympic athletes some of whom are asian american it is disturbing to oca that spains basketball team would introduce such divisive imagery into the olympics
4094386 if they havent realized their mistake yet they probably will hear about it when the nba season comes back around
4094387 it was a gesture of affection and identification with the chinese people
4094388 ultimately there is a very good relationship between the chinese and spanish governments and there is no kind of conflict at all between the two peoples
4094389 from here i would like to declare that we have a huge respect for the east and their people
4094390 anyone who would like to interpret this differently is absolutely confused
4094391 they have these little soda biscuits inside these little crackers and we were just sitting there eating crackers the whole time
4094392 every time you would think you would run out they would bring more i dont know where they get them from but thats truly what we did we just ate crackers for four hours
4094393 everybodys crammed in there we just talked and let the hours go by i guess
4094394 during the second rain delay i was handed an appendix to the rules
4094395 it was then that we learned if there was a delay of 90 minutes or more that the game can be called it wasnt signed i dont know if we could have gotten back in the game but with the bases loaded and no outs i cant say that we would not have put any runs on the board
4094396 the answer was that you cannot protest procedures only rules which is not really an answer so i dont know how to take that but thats what i was told
4094397 youve got to give the protest to the technical committee just hand it out to the umpire then they go upstairs to find the rule and you get an answer it might be a good idea to hand these things out to all the teams earlier in the tournament rather than when these things happen they told me i could ask for it but its kind of hard to ask for things that you dont know exist
4094398 when the umpire says the game is over i shook his hands and told my guys thats it
4094399 you know i would hate to have to get my team back up after telling them the games over its never happened to me i dont know what i would have done i would have probably protested that but were already at the highest level so i dont know what you do
4094400 its something ive never experienced swimming two different races in the same day especially coming off such a big final
4094401 but i think i coped well got through the heats well and got a lot more in store for tomorrow
4094402 but if you dont believe youre going to swim fast and you can do it just dont come out and swim because youre not going to give yourself a chance
4094403 mahto committed suicide in the courts toilet by using his cotton towel locally known as gamcha
4094404 the number of properties that have been foreclosed on by the banks and still havent sold is the highest weve ever seen
4094405 i expect the expansion to remain modest certainly into next year because i think it will take some time for the headwinds to dissipate
4094406 we are in a worldwide crisis now because of excessive deregulation
4094407 things are going to be very tough in the second half of the year
4094408 no one is going to buy a car company like this in the market that its in
4094409 one could argue is it worth as much as they paid for it initially based on todays market
4094410 yeah i cant remember im sure i said this is the policy what happened again hadleys got notes on all this stuff
4094411 i do not see tough calls willing to be made by the body politic
4094412 procedurile pentru achizitia celor 26 de trenuri si 87 de escalatoare trebuie demarate si incheiate pana la sfarsitul anului 2008 o parte din bani exista fiind primiti la ultima rectificare bugetara din iulie si speram ca la urmatoarea rectificare sa primim restul sumei necesare pentru achizitii si lucrari
4094413 you miss one tackle like i experienced last week and its a try so there is a lot of pressure on there
4094414 its the joys of international sport you mark someone who is world class and its something i really pride myself on my d so when you make one little slip up once and it leads to a try it really
4094415 hopefully you move on and learn from it it didnt cost us the game thankfully so if i learn from it then i will look back on it and maybe its done you some good
4094416 yeah mortlock brian odriscoll and guys like that it is tough but its part of the challenge i enjoy
4094417 you need that experience to read the opposition attack and as you say de villiers is another world class and will be a handful wherever he plays
4094418 jean does that quite a bit in super 14 weve noticed on the tapes that quite often on defence he will move to outside centre and then on attack switch back to inside so its something we are used to with him
4094419 he orchestrates a lot of their attack so we will have to be on our toes but we are worrying more about what we have to do and i guess if thats affecting the game in any way then we will deal with it on the day
4094420 they base a lot of their game on taking small opportunities and making it count the pace they have out wide and the midfielders theyve got
4094421 their game will be about building pressure and then when they create a mistake they pounce thats how their games been for years
4094422 the coaches have been true to their word right from the start they said they would not leave guys without any games so we knew that would happen
4094423 i have always had the confidence of the coaches even though i wasnt playing i was told the reasons why and it wasnt like i was left in the dark about it
4094424 we all recall of course john mccains outrage when the united states violated this rule back in 2003
4094425 if you cant keep a promise to your family cant keep a promise to your wife youre having an affair youre lying about the affair repeatedly why should the american people trust you when you say youre not gonna lie to them why should we trust you
4094426 thats a great question sean asked amanda if thats true you cant trust somebody who had an affair how can we trust john mccain to be president of the united states since he cheated by his own admission on his first wife he didnt keep his marital vows he didnt keep his pledge to his first family
4094427 i was too angry when i wrote studio 60 the show became like the cover of abbey road everybody was trying to figure out who this character was in real life or what that incident was trying to be but the anger it was a post 9 11 anger we were going through a time when the television networks were so sensitive toward appearing patriotic and patriotism was just being questioned all over the place it just seemed like the wheels had come off our national culture
4094428 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what f ck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
4094429 this study should be enlightening and practice changing for doctors and patients alike
4094430 what we can say is that its safe to defer pci
4094431 we can also say that for people with severe angina its quite reasonable to do more quick intervention
4094432 rather than being an effect of culture in a broad sense this finding might reflect a basic difference between non phonetic and phonetic written language alphabetic words such as english words can be ready by assembling fine grained phonemic units whereas chinese characters consist of intricate strokes and map onto phonology at the mono syllable level 648
4094433 as cross cultural psychology has offered accumulating evidence that social cognition and social behaviour depend greatly on sociocultural context social neuroscientists are now beginning to consider cultural effects on the neural substrates of human cognition the meaning of cultural differences could be extended to include not only groups with different social contexts and languages but also groups with different religious beliefs 647
4094434 individuals from one group after they have been primed with different cultural knowledge
4094435 of course there is no such thing as a homogeneous western or east asian culture
4094436 it is important to remember that even though the same brain region might be recruited by different cultural groups during the same cognitive task two cultural might have different meanings for the concepts involved in the task 652
4094437 our brains and mind are shaped by our experiences which mainly occur in the context of the culture in which we develop and live
4094438 do cultural experiences only modulate pre existing and pre established patterns of neural activity or do they determine the patterns
4094439 t here are some brain regions in which activity is the same across different cultures for instance the lateral occipital cortex seems to be implicated in object processing tasks across different cultural groups on the other hand the neural activity in some brain areas strongly depends on a persons cultural background for example that of the premotor cortex during mental calculation 652
4094440 future transcultural neuroimaging studies could investigate alleles that do or do not differ between cultural groups and then relate their findings to the neural activity that is associated with culture invariant and culture sensitive tasks and stimuli studying second generation immigrants would provide a way to investigate the interaction between genetic and cultural backgrounds 652
4094441 what are the neural differences between native people and newly arrived short term and long term immigrants fmri studies of immigrants might help us to understand where how and on what timescale the neural substrates of cognitive processes change as a function of cultural influence 653
4094442 another interesting question is whether there are culture specific symptoms of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and depression and if so whether these are reflected in structural or functional neural differences for example the specific form of delusion that is experienced by a patient with schizophrenia might depend on the patients cultural background 653
4094443 last year some 1 96 million visitor arrivals came from indonesia which accounted for nearly 20 of the total visitors to singapore total passenger movements by air between indonesia and singapore reached 3 86 million in 2007 registering a 6 5 year on year growth over 2006 the launch of airasia indonesias new service between the two countries today is well poised to capitalise on such strong growth
4094444 we are excited about extending our china route network to include nonstop service to shanghai
4094445 shanghai is the largest pacific market currently not served by continental and offers significant opportunities for growth in the future

4094455 we need fresh new leadership in washington d c a proven leader like mike huckabee he wasnt too well known on the campaign stump until he got his biggest break the stephen colbert bump

4094464 there will be voluntary redundancies and some changes to work practices but our members have looked at these in the context of the long term future of the plant and voted accordingly
4094465 four months ago this community was facing total closure and a very bleak future today we can look forward to security of jobs for the majority and fair treatment for those who choose to accept the necessary redundancies

4094476 the story starts with this springs military offensive by the iraqi government to oust the shiite militias from the southern city of basra the british were given coalition control in the south starting in 2003 yet when the iraqi military ran into trouble at the start of their operation this year the 4 100 brits remained in their garrison at the airport outside the city the iraqis had to call in the americans from the north for air cover and other support to help defeat radical cleric moqtada mahdi army it was the first time the u s had deployed to the british controlled region of iraq in five years the operation turned into a major success with the mahdi army routed and the iraq government in control
4094477 four thousand british troops including elements of the sas and an entire mechanised brigade watched from the sidelines for six days because of an
4094478 the deal which aimed to encourage the shia movement back into the political process and marginalise extremist factions has dealt a huge blow to britains reputation in iraq
4094479 without the support of the americans we would not have accomplished the mission because the british forces had done nothing there i do not trust the british forces they did not want to lose any soldiers for the mission
4094480 i was not happy everybody just assumed that because this deal was cut nobody was going in cutting a deal with the bad guys is generally not a good idea
4094481 a coalition force would make a pact with essentially their enemy and promise not to go into their area so as not to get attacked
4094482 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration
4094483 dolly is awesome i idolise her and she is beautiful i would love to be just like her i have worked with her and it was great

4094564 georgia has carried out a scorched earth policy savagely bombing residential areas of tskhinvali the capital of south ossetia and has also bombed peaceful south ossetian villages
4094565 this is a clearly ethnic cleansing which is a war crime and violation of international law the aim of this policy was to clear south ossetia of ossetians and the territory thus cleared would be seized
4094566 such criminal actions do fall under the definition of genocide there is considerable evidence of violations of standards of international humanitarian law by the georgian side
4094567 provocative acts conducted by the russian side itself or through satellite separatist regimes in georgia
4094568 causing mass destruction and severe damage to the civilian population and infrastructure
4094569 these acts have been done in grave breach of the rules of international humanitarian law such as violation of the principle of distinction between military and civilian objects followed by incidents of mistreatment of civilians and looting of villages by russian armed forces

4094582 tomorrow were going to negotiate all day i cant predict the result but its clear that were closer to the demands of prime minister donald tusk than we were a month ago
4094583 we are perhaps going to reap the reward of our efforts
4094584 the american side has considerably softened its stance over recent days
4094585 they are much readier to accept polands two cardinal conditions
4094586 today were facing a new international situation the situation doesnt change our arguments but in my view reinforces them
4094587 the rising international tension which has caught us by surprise makes security guarantees even more important than ever
4094588 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
4094589 as soon as we are sure that polands security has been reinforced to the degree we want were not going to wait for hours to sign a deal
4094590 this important issue for poland will perhaps reach a happy end

4094594 theres a lot more anxiety about the credibility and value of american relationships including security relationships

4094602 answer chocolate pizza like eldorado is a quest that has obsessed humankind for hundreds of years or at least since the days of conquest
4094603 but caf veneto the casual sister restaurant of the excellent locanda veneta next door seems to have mastered the ancient difficulties and the chocolate hazelnut pizza essentially a lightly caramelized pizza crust split stuffed with nutella and sprinkled with powdered sugar is supreme in its category

4094620 thank you for contacting me about karl roves failure to appear before the judiciary committee i appreciate that you took the time to share your thoughts with me the judiciary committee is taking karl roves failure to testify very seriously and we are currently considering all options including contempt proceedings to compel him to answer important questions regarding the firing of several u s attorneys some have suggested that congress implement inherent contempt as if that is a viable option the jail cell in the basement of the capitol doesnt exist and the sergeant at arms is an over 60 year old executive congress is not a police force and we will likely need to continue to utilize the courts and system of justice to pursue these matters again thanks for being in touch please do not hesitate to let me know if i may ever be of assistance to you or your family
4094621 resolved that rooms a and b opposite the room of the solicitor of the court of claims in the capitol be and are hereby assigned as guardroom and office of the capitol police and are for that purpose placed under charge of the sergeant at arms of the house with power to fit the same up for purpose specified resolved that said wooley for his repeated contempt of the authority of the house be kept until otherwise ordered by the house in close confinement in the guardroom of the capitol police by the sergeant at arms until said wooley shall fully answer the questions above recited and all questions put to him by said committee in relation to the subject of the investigations with which the committee is charged and that meanwhile no person shall communicate with said wooley in writing or verbally except upon the order of the speaker
4094622 under the inherent contempt power the house sergeant at arms has the authority to take karl rove into custody and bring him to the house where his contempt case can be tried presumably by a standing or select committee if he is found by the house to be in contempt of congress he can be imprisoned for an amount of time determined by the house not to exceed the term of the 110th congress which ends the beginning of january 2009 or until he agrees to testify the supreme court has recognized the power of the house to enforce its own subpoenas through the inherent contempt provision stating that without it congress would be exposed to every indignity and interruption that rudeness caprice or even conspiracy may mediate against it before congress asked the justice department to try contempt cases on its behalf the inherent contempt power was used more than 85 times between 1795 and 1934 mostly to compel testimony and documents
4094623 both chambers also have an inherent contempt power allowing either body to hold its own trials and even jail those found in defiance of congress although widely used during the 19th century the power has not been invoked since 1934 and democratic lawmakers have not displayed an appetite for reviving the practice

4094718 if you can skim 50 calories off your diet each time you eat out you are going to reduce your weight gain and might even lose weight this analysis suggests that a painless way to make that happen is to put calorie information on menu boards for everyone to see it will be of great benefit to the 82 percent of california adults who regularly eat at fast food chains

4094819 i cant imagine theres going to be a repeal by the board
4094820 that doesnt sound like its in the cards at this point
4094821 my best guess is were going to uphold the annexation ordinances and that were probably looking at a special election
4094822 our intent was not to make it so that only 300 people would decide on something that affects the whole community
4094823 obviously it has a regional impact but i think it principally is firestones i think people could make a case that we should have a special election
4094824 well be asking tonight where is it that we can find the information we need to make a responsible decision
4094825 when i talk to constituents and to people around town it sounds like its got community support
4094826 if they say no we go back to square one and support the vote of the people
4094827 certainly a very high qualified candidate for us to consider
4094828 mr haddad exceeds all the qualifications of any other district
4094829 its not an accident that we have an excellent candidate
4094830 we decided that would be a good option for us
4094831 the city recommended that and were trying to be as cooperative as possible
4094832 in practical terms the arbitrator is not answerable to anyone and certainly not to the voters or the city council since it is virtually impossible to overturn the arbitrators decision
4094833 the arbitrators decision is final and binding and will constitute the wages benefits and terms and conditions of employment for police and fire employees for the next 1 3 years
4094834 if this is how we can show our reasonableness if this is a system that works and its been shown to work then were open to it
4094835 we just want to get out there and do whats best for the citizens and for us
4094836 i still think what we have now is working for us
4094837 its a very good situation so i just dont see a reason for change i just dont see a need for a union
4094838 at this point theres nothing standing in our way of continuing to do what we said were going to do

4094841 i dont take it personally im actually reading this book called the four agreements and thats what chapter two is about not taking things personally if you take it personally then its true

4094843 i dont just break down study terrell owens i break down the top receivers

4094845 i told him that and ive got a good message for him today a really good one thats going to be on my back tomorrow a nice little saying
4094846 i thought it was good for both teams and it was a very healthy practice good fresh hitting
4094847 when you go against somebody who you dont know their tendencies i think everybody plays a little bit more honest and its a good evaluation process for us

4094854 kayaking is just a nice way to slow down from the pace of modern american life and slide along at natures pace
4094855 i mainly do things for fun the exercise is a kind of a hidden bonus
4094856 but the joy is bonding with the horse and knowing that i have to keep him in shape for competition
4094857 to be the best that we can be as a team i need to keep myself in shape too
4094858 we have had a lot of people dump those in local waters
4094859 they are bad for the local fish they dont really belong in the resident populations or waters
4094860 i was still trying to think of other possibilities besides piranha
4094861 were competing for jobs right now so im still playing
4094862 a little toughness always helps just trying to push through some things
4094863 thats just part of it a lot of people go through life whether they have back problems or health problems and they have to strap it on every day and go to work or get it going and thats part of the deal
4094864 that just speaks to the kind of character he has hes never said boo about it
4094865 weve been playing guys who have no experience starters back ups everybody
4094866 id like to get on the field and show them what i got if i get the chance
4094867 really i look forward to the challenge year in and year out of battling for the position
4094868 at the same time i know it brings out the best in the two players and the best man wins
4094869 ive been looking at old tapes and just going back to my old fundamentals of playing middle
4094870 but its like second nature because ive played it all my life
4094871 maybe it was uncomfortable when i first got out there but playing ball is playing ball
4094872 if i looked forward to every team ive been with id be looking forward to every place we go
4094873 im not getting as many reps as i thought id be getting but im still out there trying to work and keep on getting better
4094874 of course im getting frustrated because i feel i have what it takes to get out there and make it happen
4094875 but i just havent had the opportunities to do what i can do
4094876 i have to play well every time whether its preseason practice one on ones
4094877 any time the camera is on or the coaches are watching i have to do what i need to do to make an impression and let them know that im still here
4094878 mike shanahan and myself we have a bond from the 02 season when i was here he understands what i can do
4094879 this seems like a good time to close this chapter in my life and move on to the next one
4094880 my family has encouraged me to retire so they can watch something other than channel 3 on tuesday nights
4094881 it was simply a discussion of performance and after the discussion douglas decided it was a good time to retire
4094882 it has been truly rewarding to serve in this position with many dedicated talented and hardworking people i take comfort knowing that the city is in such capable hands
4094883 hes going to be missed i wish him the best
4094884 guess what the average voter in this town does not read these blogs or buy into this muckraking pack of designed deception of the truth
4094885 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4094886 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4094887 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4094888 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4094889 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4094890 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4094891 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4094892 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4094893 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4094894 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4094895 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4094896 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4094897 si balza no ve que detr s de la marcha de bilbao est a
4094898 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4094899 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4094914 the proximity to one of the finest unspoiled beaches in the world gives us the opportunity to create something special
4094915 the ho tram strip will combine entertainment adventure and leisure vacations into one exceptional vacation experience
4094916 at this point we are staying at 6 billion concerns about cost over runs for the project are unsubstantiated costs are under control despite high oil prices

4094930 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
4094931 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby
4094932 now this story is no matter of mere opinion there is no possibility that obama just has a different opinion on a controversial national issue than we do as daniel patrick moynihan once famously said one is entitled to his own opinion but not his own facts what we have here is obama simply telling a lie and knowingly doing so will the old media continue to cover up for him like they have done for the last four years
4094933 i guess for me it was probably the people i met at central when i was looking at schools the people i met at central just made a great first impression on me everybody was really nice and that was the biggest thing that brought me to central the students faculty and professors all felt like they were there for all the time
4094934 they will be connected for a lifetime and challenged to do things they never dreamed theyd be able to do students at central have a community of people who know them and who will challenge them its that community that makes central different

4094938 i think that the best reason to come to centenary is probably because its a small school so instead of having these predestined paths laid in front of you like you want to be a communications major and this is what you have to do here you have to figure out what you want to do and make your own decisions and lay out your own path and because its a small school you have so many more opportunities to figure out your own path we have everything that a big school has a newspaper a radio station but because were small you get to do much more you get to put together your own future
4094939 superior preparation for graduate schools professional schools and careers its a small school and students feel like they are a vital part of a supportive community

4095050 our belief is that naked short selling was never a problem with these stocks
4095051 we think the sec are going to read into this data that a lot of short sellers exited positions
4095052 but we believe a careful look will show was that naked short selling was not ferreted out but that it was regular legitimate short sellers who were closing their positions

4095080 i think we should be okay now neither of us used an ability and even if that had happened they wouldnt be able to tell
4095081 only one guy followed teal im sure he can handle whatever hes got i know hes not supposed to be a fighter but he can do something right i just wish we had some way to communicate with him hes got that little voice box on him right maybe we could use that
4095082 then in turn he could call teal from the radio on his waist
4095083 i dont either and its not like theres a lot of payphones around these days
4095084 teal made a lot of mistakes back there this is precisely the reason i didnt want to go out tonight its too risky
4095085 i thought the kid had a little more common sense than this he panicked from what i heard roalds got a definite interest in teal but after tonight i cant see why hanging off the side of the building would only draw more suspicion and the guy were after if that was actually him doesnt know who we are or what were here for does he always act like this
4095086 look he seems like a good person but possibly the wrong type of person for this mission hes been compromised by the media and possibly us as well so were going to either report back to chicago or completely alter our looks
4095087 changing our looks would probably be harder than dealing with roald
4095088 were closing in twenty minutes so if youre going to order something nows the time
4095089 my name is jake this is my daughter were on vacation
4095090 new york really for vacation maybe if you still had a wife around youd have a little more sense than to come to this pit for fun you dont have a wife do you thats fine im sure youre doing a good job being a dad and all
4095091 if you want you can start closing up now well only be a minute more
4095092 whats the hurry i have no plans tonight does she talk
4095093 are you waiting for anybody you seem like youre waiting for something or maybe someone
4095094 oh so she does talk thats amusing whos this teal
4095095 he wasnt interested in a musical so we told him to meet us around here
4095096 if you tell me what he looks like i can point him in your direction after the diner closes
4095097 dont worry about it im sure well find him soon enough this place is lighted hell see it we can stay here until he comes theres no problem with that right
4095098 yes i wouldnt mind if the two of you stayed
4095099 well put it back you can do that right damn i never knew you could do this much
4095100 the kind that can make you act like a fish for the rest of your pathetic life if you dont do exactly what we say
4095101 well then well have to just be careful then wont we
4095102 id prefer that you simply forgot everything you are thinking right now
4095103 father daughter eh you think the government would like to meet the rest of your family its probably an interesting one by the likes of you two
4095104 dont worry im not going to tell on you youre those people that can do all the special things right you really need a name
4095105 so this teal hes another one of you what can he do disappear
4095106 oh yes you can make me do what you wish is that it is that your power
4095107 you seem too happy with yourself maybe we should do something about that
4095108 maybe you should papa bear but dont worry about little old me im just the simple son of a restaurant owner but if i were the two of you id worry more about how thick my spandex was for this cold new york or maybe about how i could spread out with my colleagues to save the world fastest
4095109 youre done now just give me some of that coffee
4095110 nah this is my only one homes kinda far from here
4095111 we can get out of here in a moment psi i hope you do realize that you did this
4095112 we have to go right now is there a back door to this place
4095113 this guy knows who we are hes coming with us
4095114 didnt you see that psi of course im going to take this little bastard with us
4095115 the protesters and a few other people saw me when i went back to look for you it wasnt a very good idea i think
4095116 but theres about forty people a few blocks back i dont know how ive been able to run faster than them this far
4095117 i know im really sorry i saw him though i really did i just panicked is all
4095118 no its not at least we know hes still here right

4095177 either enter jordan without religious objects or go back to israel
4095178 they seemed to know exactly what they were looking for
4095179 it was very demeaning to have such a negative experience in what is billed as a friendly country people in the group including the tour guides were quite shocked no one had ever heard that jordan imposed religious restrictions
4095180 what made it worse was that the whole thing seemed to be directed solely at jews i saw christians walking through into jordan openly wearing crosses apparently christian religious symbols did not seem to be a problem for the jordanians i can well imagine the international outcry if islamic tourists were to encounter such restrictions on their entry into israel
4095181 the jordanian security authorities are responsible for the safety of all visitors to the kingdom and it is our duty to take all measures required in this regard

4095201 i had to go down there and im glad i had the chance
4095202 on a course like mine you really need the chance to sell yourself and to prove your enthusiasm for the subject it was a very worthwhile process to be able to go to the university and do just that
4095203 you can get the grades but thats just a piece of paper im glad i could show them that id sick with it and not drop out which is something a lot of unis unfortunately experience
4095204 i didnt have an interview but i think it would be a great way of sorting out the people with high grades it lets the university people get a vibe and feel the students passion if its there
4095205 itd be scary probably but worth it after all this is something thats going to affect your whole life if its something you really want to do youve got to jump at every chance to show that

4095211 its part of our focus on those cold winter places where phoenix is very attractive
4095212 were very pleased with phoenix mesa gateway we have an especially good working relationship with the airport administration and the new routes weve just announced reflect that
4095213 we continue to work with gateway management and its possible well have more to announce but it would be premature to talk about that now
4095214 while different industry events could affect where we grow we believe our business model is so different that to some extent well be able to find opportunity at least for the foreseeable future within reason no matter what happens
4095215 in terms of a different type of aircraft its something that we constantly evaluate for years now
4095216 up until now more md 80s has always come up as the right answer but the price of other types of aircraft have dropped a lot recently and the price of fuel has gone up
4095217 clearly theres a tipping point where another aircraft type probably makes sense but were not convinced were there yet
4095218 the airport is anticipating more traffic than ever this holiday season
4095219 well be putting up the modules in the next couple of months when allegiant starts doing multiple flights at the same time we wouldnt be able to handle them without the expansion theyll be temporary until we can put up a permanent structure

4095223 the credibility of the female witnesses all of whom have faced multiple felony counts of drug and other offenses will play a crucial role in the trial we have a lot of evidence to present
4095224 most of these offenses are aggravating especially when they come from any public official who had imposed upon them the duty of care and trust
4095225 i just tried to black out the whole thing it was bad
4095226 i understand they have put puryear in the controversial category
4095227 its very rare for a district court nominee to become controversial usually they just fly through
4095228 groups can attack a nominee but youll never see the nominee respond to anything except at hearings
4095229 as far as his qualifications go he was at the top of his class in law school he clerked on the u s court of appeals he has legislative experience in the u s senate he manages litigation for a big fortune 500 company and the aba american bar association rated him as qualified
4095230 gus realizes this is a lame duck year in politics
4095231 its true for all nominees whether youre in the deal or not is beyond your control

4095242 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible

4095286 i honestly never imagined i would be able to make a living doing something that was so much fun i am very glad i was wrong
4095287 i certainly dont want to be losing one of my best players
4095288 but the quota system means difficult decisions have to be taken at the right time he has been very supportive of both the club and myself
4095289 i have been in london now for four years and feel it is about time i returned home my mum has been trying to get me back home ever since i left and you can only say no to your mum for so long
4095290 my experience here has been the best of my life and i have the players staff and our supporters to thank for making my time so enjoyable
4095291 although i return to my family and friends in australia i feel that i will always be welcome back at the stoop and look forward to visiting in the future
4095292 on behalf of everyone at harlequins rugby league i wish mark all the best for the future and thank him for all he has done for our club
4095293 i know that everyone associated with the club has appreciated what he can do on a rugby pitch and has enjoyed his company off the pitch
4095294 he returns to australia with a tremendous reputation and should be very proud of what he has achieved during his time in london
4095295 pride in the projects teens building identities in urban contexts
4095296 cause you wouldnt usually see people think of the projects as bad
4095297 and that you wouldnt see birds or anything over here so thats why i took that
4095298 bj does not speak for all teens growing up in americas inner city public housing
4095299 but she and her peers at the east side boys and girls club provide us a glimpse of how settings become sites for resistance and reconstruction for recognition and relationships their narratives demonstrate the active contextual and relational nature of adolescent identity in todays complex world understanding the ways in which adolescents make meaning in and of their contexts both local and societal is key to understanding the process of adolescent development in 21st century america
4095300 this is the most powerful and original book on adolescent development i have read in recent years
4095301 friendship cliques and gangs young black men coming of age in urban america
4095302 first and primarily i seek to push forward developmental theory specifically in the area of adolescent identity development
4095303 second i seek to inform youth practice and policy particularly in the realm of after school programs examining how youth negotiate and build identities in after school contexts settings in which they voluntarily choose to participate can help researchers understand how youth use their social contexts and relationships in their construction of self and thereby how these and other settings can best support youth development

4095305 oh you think lightning is just a form of electricity where does hail come from then its all very well to say electricity explains lightning but i dont see how electricity has anything to do with hail
4095306 how can we rationalize the fact that the real world fails to lead us to god
4095307 i recognized that unless you understood both languages you would not fully understand the conditions under which people live in contemporary tibet and their hopes and fears
4095308 in the past people have tended to see tibet in a vacuum we want to show its embedded in complex economic social and political frameworks
4095309 the university of virginia is a global nexus for tibetan studies
4095310 the center will expand u va s profile by moving into public policy law and the contemporary arena to create a continuum of teaching research community services and dialogue we see it as a meeting place for people from many perspectives
4095311 people are drawn to tibet because of the himalayan mountains
4095312 also we have been fascinated by buddhism since the 1960s and tibet is one of the great strongholds of buddhist culture this interest has expanded with the emergence of the dalai lama as a global figure of spirituality and peace
4095313 we think of this library not as just a repository of books images maps audio video and other forms of knowledge but as a profoundly social institution just like the library in the rotunda in u va s early history
4095314 he was extremely impressed with the jefferson legacy and u va s digital prowess
4095315 the idea is to create a continuum of knowledge knowledge doesnt just involve scholars but includes videographers tourists local residents and children
4095316 u va thus becomes a base enabling a broad spectrum of people to contribute to global knowledge about tibet
4095317 although the chungba kids had never gone to school before they led the county test scores in their very first year
4095318 as partners in this effort i think we all realize the tremendous opportunities this geotourism training offers for tibetan communities as well as for our own institutions and organizations
4095319 the word sherpa means from the east signifying their original roots in eastern tibet
4095320 we hope to create a new kind of space in the tibetan world
4095321 we want to have an institution where all kinds of different stakeholders can come together without antagonism but in a spirit of cooperation and reconciliation
4095322 it is an extraordinary privilege to be a jack kent cooke foundation scholar
4095323 when i got the phone call i was in shock
4095324 its extremely unusual to go to yale law and the kennedy school of government for a combined degree
4095325 daniel is the only person in the past six years to graduate with highest honors from the honors politics program he was an extraordinary student whose work was of the highest standards and went beyond the classroom
4095326 these experiences made me feel from a young age that government can be a place where dedicated individuals come together in service of a cause larger than themselves
4095327 i want to have a modest influence on public policy
4095328 he will be heavily recruited by top law firms and government agencies
4095329 this is the latest in a long string of awards for daniel
4095330 hes just as bright as they come he will make u va proud
4095331 he one of the most unassuming and congenial students and a pleasure to be with
4095332 the jack kent cooke graduate scholarship is extraordinarily generous and extremely competitive
4095333 i am so pleased that daniel has been recognized with this honor not only did he shine academically but he also made a lasting contribution through his work with the mock trial team he is an outstanding representative of the university
4095334 there seem to be a particularly large crop of books about obama
4095335 what is he like as a family man how he is able to capture the audience and what is the rock star persona that he has been able to create
4095336 this young audience all of which had grown up essentially with one president all of a sudden was paying attention to politics and to the world in a way that i thought was galvanizing
4095337 youd have to be quite a writer to do justice to this mans story and if you read
4095338 for tom with our love always mum dad andy maxine and all who love you xx
4095339 tom was an experienced scout so its a mystery why this happened
4095340 he had been in the scout movement since he was six and had been hiking in mountainous areas since he was 13 we think he slipped and fell
4095341 were a very close knit family and its the worst thing that could have happened
4095342 but we had to bear in mind that when he went off on these adventures we knew there was a possibility this could happen
4095343 but we know from texts and photos that he was having the time of his life
4095344 tom was the friendliest most outgoing person you could meet he knew lots of people and was into so much
4095345 he was passionately green and into recycling and although he could drive he would cycle everywhere
4095346 he also stood for the green party here in the may local elections representing pin green and martins wood and he was hoping he would become an mp for the green party
4095347 he had a fantastic future ahead of him and was planning on going to mongolia china and russia next year
4095348 tom has achieved everything he set out to do and would have gone on to achieve so much more
4095349 this is absolutely heartbreaking for his family and many friends
4095350 all our thoughts are with toms family at this sad time

4095354 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4095355 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4095356 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4095357 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4095358 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4095359 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4095360 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4095361 the international olympic committee is no stranger to overzealous protection of what they perceive to be their intellectual property weve covered their ridiculous attempts to
4095362 dijo asimismo a la mujer multiplicar tus trabajos y miserias en tus pre eces con dolor parir s los hijos y estar s bajo la potestad o mando de tu marido y l te dominar
4095363 we were very disappointed the evening of the match but we started to work as coaches have to do with players
4095364 but we were in the same situation in the algarve cup and we beat germany 2 0 in the third place match so were quite used to the situation i think weve handled it well
4095365 in both competitions norway collapsed by surrendering four goals in the second half in march it cost norway a chance for the algarve title
4095366 each of the teams in the quarterfinals is of high quality we beat the u s 2 0 and lost 5 1 to japan that shows me how even the teams are
4095367 we played very well against the united states and in the third game we played very badly in the second half
4095368 we have a very young team thats the price you pay for so young a side
4095369 the two powers havent faced off since the 2003 world cup when daniela rosana marta and katia scored a goal each and brazil won 4 1
4095370 theyre bigger than us and we cant put too much emphasis on things like speed
4095371 that does not make for a complete match the most important thing for us against norway is to make use of our technical ability
4095372 the teams wont be a complete surprise to one another
4095373 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4095374 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4095375 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4095376 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4095377 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4095378 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4095379 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4095380 mr j were really sorry and dont know what happened dr l would love to see you and she says shes really sorry she didnt get to see you today could you come in at 11 15 tomorrow
4095381 i dont know why they wouldnt see you yesterday it makes no sense of course dr p would have seen you
4095382 the magnitude of robin zander the charisma of rick neilsen
4095383 when these players go to europe they change they come back here and think that we cannot do without them
4095384 they mustnt be ball hogs football is not a show game it is business
4095385 were still a young team and sometimes we dont show maturity at the right times like when we were 2 0 ahead
4095386 thats the time when you just need to keep the ball you dont need to go forward in numbers or make rash challenges at the back
4095387 he siasia knows what he wants he knows his players and really tries to bring the best out of them
4095388 stefan und niko kommt ihr doch bitte rein und der rest hat bestanden ihr k nnt jetzt heim gehn
4095389 call the chamber back into session in order to deal with the serious problems facing the state
4095390 michigans elected officials need to recognize that their delay in passing clean energy is costing michigan jobs
4095391 the state has a great opportunity to diversify its economy but it is slipping away senate leaders need to stop playing politics and get to work on completing this package
4095392 our sole goal is to safely and rapidly deliver humanitarian aid to georgia to alleviate human suffering and save lives
4095393 we will continue to support this humanitarian mission until the host nation and the u s state department determine that it is no longer needed
4095394 thank you so much for helping us in this great time of need these supplies will surely save lives
4095395 im not co producing it and i wont be involved in any way the first i heard about it was when people sent me cuttings from us papers
4095396 to suggest ive given the project my seal of approval
4095397 i have no view on whether it should be remade but it doesnt have my blessing
4095398 the simulcast service will exploit the power of the itv1 brand the familiarity of the audience with the architecture of the schedule as well as the fact that itv invests circa 90 of the itv1 programme budget in the peak time schedule
4095399 should include ethernet ports and pvr hard drives to allow for the early introduction of a push video on demand service enabling more viewers to access public service broadcasting programming for viewing at a time to suit them
4095400 con had been holding sarahs hand but now he released it and stood up
4095401 god it would be nice to beat the u s
4095402 if you play against teams that are maybe tactically naive who are in their infancy that will work for a period of time
4095403 theyre more possession oriented theyre more willing to pass the ball around and make us chase
4095404 theres such a huge rivalry between us were always so close but they always manage to win it most teams who play the u s a say we can beat them but again they keep winning
4095405 i had a few friends on the u s team say you almost had us we really could have won the game
4095406 if it werent for an obvious march towards a police state steve would be a shoe in too bad the liberals and ndp arent worth voting for
4095407 what are the people the ones who have been forced from their homes saying about this conflict
4095408 you seen men of god and men who kill in gods name
4095409 the percentage of buyers of virtual goods is a lot lower than in asia
4095410 b ut another significant difference with asia is once americans become a buyer they buy a lot more than asian buyers
4095411 any driver that failed to pay the stipulated fine and attend the mandatory 45 minutes public enlightment to sensitize them on the essential of road safety and how to exhibit discipline on the high way would have his vehicle impounded
4095412 frsc has the instrument equaliser to determine the level of alcoholic in every driver and every truck driver must attend the test anyone found guilty will not be allowed to drive
4095413 the implication is that indian hemp is the most widely cultivated trafficked and abused drug in the country
4095414 what we are about to witness is a complete victory for humanity and a demonstration of the superiority of the state over organised crime and criminality
4095415 the key to a successful lead beginning is quite simple it must attract and hold readers by re creating in their minds the same curiosity that drove you to undertake the story in the first place
4095416 i have been amazed to discover how much time i have saved and how much anxiety i have avoided by having a clear structure in mind if not on paper

4095438 self medication may be the reason the blogosphere has taken off
4095439 scientists now hope to explore the neurological underpinnings at play especially considering the explosion of blogs
4095440 the healthy type the therapeutic value of blogging becomes a focus of study
4095441 in high school jeff was reborn as a christian when he went off to college he became the worship leader for the on campus christian fellowship jeff tells his story on how he ran into the bahai faith while at college
4095442 the relief and rehabilitation process might take longer than the security operations
4095443 our army engineers are ready to help in the rehabilitation efforts including in rebuilding hundreds of houses destroyed and damaged during the conflict
4095444 the next task would be to help civilian agencies in handling the displaced people
4095445 the security situation has improved but it will probably take a bit of time before people feel secure enough to return home en masse
4095446 we have to be looking ahead to people having to potentially rebuild their lives a lot of houses villages have been destroyed
4095447 some of them need a little counselling most do not a lot of them are used to it its not the first time that this has happened
4095448 we recognize that in america this is going after somebody who is more comfortable with technology
4095449 the truth is that in other countries its becoming a part of their culture the trend is coming and as a fashion company its very important to identify trends and get ahead of them
4095450 this is about someone whos interested in our brand and interested in technology and wherever the two meet thats whats appropriate

4095452 i certainly dont want to be losing one of my best players
4095453 but the quota system means difficult decisions have to be taken at the right time he has been very supportive of both the club and myself
4095454 i have been in london now for four years and feel it is about time i returned home my mum has been trying to get me back home ever since i left and you can only say no to your mum for so long
4095455 my experience here has been the best of my life and i have the players staff and our supporters to thank for making my time so enjoyable
4095456 although i return to my family and friends in australia i feel that i will always be welcome back at the stoop and look forward to visiting in the future
4095457 on behalf of everyone at harlequins rugby league i wish mark all the best for the future and thank him for all he has done for our club
4095458 i know that everyone associated with the club has appreciated what he can do on a rugby pitch and has enjoyed his company off the pitch
4095459 he returns to australia with a tremendous reputation and should be very proud of what he has achieved during his time in london
4095460 among those displaced most of whom headed towards kilinochchi are people who have had to abandon their homes several times in recent months
4095461 though ngos take responsibility to make large temporary shelters they take weeks of time to make them as a result poeple are compelled to stay shades of trees during the day time
4095462 kendra got a kitchen knife and cut me on my arm
4095463 got scared and he ran over here he was bleeding
4095464 i kept telling him you dont want to do this
4095465 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
4095466 it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does after the election in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee
4095467 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4095468 brooke is basically only turning to her friends for support
4095469 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4095470 russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4095471 this is an important signal the u s will keep georgian airport and seaports open
4095472 the first plane landed and thats a turning point this is an operation led by the pentagon
4095473 they are there to neutralize a huge arsenal of arms and military hardware which they found there totally abandoned it was necessary to neutralize them in order not to create a threat for civilians
4095474 various landmarks in the united states including new york city
4095475 chemical substances in gel and liquid form that were sealed in bottles and glass jars
4095476 i believe shes become a terrible embarrassment to them but shes not a terrorist
4095477 when the truth comes out people will see she did nothing wrong
4095478 we have been under siege for the last two years
4095479 the only thing left is for them to invade and kill us
4095480 if the cease fire is just a front for extremists in gaza to rearm and regroup of course we have the right to act
4095481 any arms buildup is a direct violation of the calm that was achieved
4095482 they control the gaza strip with quite an iron fist if you dont mind me saying and none of this activity with the other groups would be happening unless hamas was complicit and allowing it to happen
4095483 hey sorry man i cant make it for oral today
4095484 oh so youre standing me up fine its okay i planned my whole day around it nevermind you
4095485 my client will have to board a flight to london his ticket has been bought by the authorities here
4095486 after he lands in london hes free to go wherever he wants
4095487 when it is known that a sex offender convicted in another country is to be deported to the uk he is met at the port of entry by police who interview him and pass any relevant information to the police in the area in which the offender is proposing to live
4095488 offenders convicted of sexual offences whether in the uk or overseas may be monitored under multi agency public protection arrangements
4095489 we have to fight back the challenges of terrorism and extremism
4095490 the war against terrorism and extremism is the war of our own survival with the peoples cooperation we will fight this war and ensure the governments writ at all costs
4095491 let me reiterate pakistans commitment to peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes so that we can together usher in an era of peace progress and prosperity for our two peoples
4095492 to improve relations with india by resolving all outstanding disputes between the two countries in a just and peaceful manner
4095493 the world must open its eyes to the plight of us tibetans rather than focusing on the beijing olympics
4095494 i will continue to protest unless china guarantees human rights in tibet
4095495 we have arrested more than 500 as they were protesting in a restricted zone
4095496 we will now need to review the full range of our relations
4095497 has been very clear for a long time ive been very concerned about russian behavior in a broad variety of areas
4095498 address the future of the alliances relationship with russia and with our g7 partners we should discuss whether it makes sense for russia to continue its participation in the g8
4095499 we also need to review russias aspiration for membership in the world trade organization
4095500 i dont think were going to re ignite the cold war here with russia i dont see this is a return to nuclear standoffs
4095501 as the russians move into georgia as aggressors and if you read the statements from the beginning from senator mccain and senator obama one had a kind of moral neutrality to it that comes i think from inexperience
4095502 we have totally reclaimed the villages occupied by rebels but troops are still clearing the areas of land mines left behind by the milf forces
4095503 i am ready to work so hard for someone else on their terms and conditions then why not to work for myself on my own terms
4095504 when you are inspired by some great purpose some extraordinary project all of your thoughts breaks their bonds your mind transcends limitations your consciousness expands in every direction and you find yourself in a new great and wonderful world dormant forces faculties and talents become alive and you discover yourself to be a greater person than you ever dreamed yourself to be

4095524 the area of individual volition for commoners was severely foreclosed by prussian psychological training procedures drawn from the experience of animal husbandry and equestrian training and also taken from past military experience
4095525 prussian schools delivered everything they promised every important matter could now be confidently worked out in advance by leading families and institutional heads because well schooled masses would concur with a minimum of opposition

4095527 quite honestly we cannot afford to fight for principle at this point when the law is against us
4095528 more often than not get into the hands of people who are coming into the home to do bad things
4095529 i dont think any of us are thrilled with the supreme court decision but the decision is sufficiently vague that it does not have any prohibition against child safety locks
4095530 while the handgun ban has been in place evanston has experienced very low rates of gun violence gun related death and injury
4095531 bringing more guns into the city of evanston will lead to costs in other areas human costs
4095532 no person shall possess any handgun except when said handgun is kept at the residence for self protection
4095533 they say thats old music but to me thats our history
4095534 there was a great renaissance in the united states in the 20s 30s and 40s and all the way up to someone contemporary like stephen sondheim theres a high level of craft thats magnificent they can play around with words and you cant believe the level of intelligence and their words are matched by great music im more than convinced that maybe 40 or 50 years from now we will definitely acknowledge that thats americas classical music
4095535 i have a special pace in my heart for ravinia
4095536 i think ive played there 20 times or so through the years and last year we broke all records for the largest amount of people that showed up they sit under the trees on the lawn with their picnic baskets and the music flows out to them i know other performers who have performed at ravinia and they just adore it
4095537 i like the fred astaire quote if it doesnt swing im outta here
4095538 i wanna be around to pick up the pieces when somebody breaks your heart
4095539 i just wanted to make sure i could get a club on it
4095540 and then i heard liz white saying go in go in
4095541 it was so steady i think he missed only one or two greens
4095542 but thats how golf is i did drain a couple of par putts
4095543 i was hitting a lot of fairways but i missed every putt i missed 7 putts less than 15 feet
4095544 this would be a nice day even if i had shot a 90
4095545 but this a lot more fun than i thought it would be
4095546 hes the most consistent birdie and double bogey player ive ever seen
4095547 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right the democratic party also strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empower people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4095548 because we believe in the privacy and equality of women we stand proudly for a womans right to choose consistent with roe v wade and regardless of her ability to pay we stand firmly against republican efforts to undermine that right at the same time we strongly support family planning and adoption incentives abortion should be safe legal and rare
4095549 the democratic platform committee really reached out to moderate religious leaders from evangelical and catholic religious communities the resulting language on abortion is a real step forward that provides some sorely needed common ground around reducing the need for abortion
4095550 on the basis that more lives will be saved than if they had just taken a moral stand hoping to overturn roe v wade
4095551 cynical partisan profiteers will find fault with the tone of this plank but knowing the battle that went into the insertion of the new language i am very encouraged that democrats have widened their public support of mothers who choose life
4095552 in the end the interpretation of the platform lies in the hands of the candidate
4095553 affirming the good of childbirth and adoption does not justify or in any way soften the partys official support for an intrinsic evil
4095554 offers an opportunity to put an end to this self destructive cycle otherwise known as regret depression and self denigration
4095555 get to work a manifesto for women of the world
4095556 cast the platform into purgatory and pick an antiabortion candidate for vice president the emancipation of women may once again become a legitimate political position
4095557 i t is time to revive the moral argument for protecting a womans right to choose abortion is about the value of womens lives

4095923 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
4095924 lin maokes voice didnt quite meet our standard the breadth and depth wasnt quite up to our standards so at last we decided from a sound perspective to use yang peiyi
4095925 the performer was lin miaoke but the sound was yang peiyi the reason is this one was for the benefit of the country the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression and lin miaoke meets our requirements in those aspects
4095926 however from a sound perspective our entire team unanimously agreed that yang peiyi fulfilled all of our requirements and more she is the best
4095927 the voice that lin miaoke heard was actually yang peiyis sound but she herself may not have realized this
4095928 it was played live at a rehearsal there were many different departments especially leaders from the politburo the central communist party leadership who all gave us their opinions that it must change so we had no choice
4095929 i think all of the listeners and audience should also understand this situation this is for the benefit of the country the national culture this is the face the image of the national music culture especially the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important extremely serious matter
4095930 i think this situation is fair for lin miaoke and yang peiyi its fair for both of them this is to say we have the best image and the best sound and we combined the two
4095931 why was the original girl not on stage because she was having dental work done
4095932 fake singing is not good but for the image and interests of the country fake singing now and again is acceptable
4095933 on a sidenote we should recognize that lip synching is in fact a form of art
4095934 lip synching has been happening for decades putting on the best performance we can is the most important plus two girls not just one got a chance to be famous their futures are very bright
4095935 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression
4095936 i was moved every time we did a rehearsal on this from the bottom of my heart
4095937 please save the last bit of trueness in our children
4095938 they think yang peiyis smile is not cute enough what we need is truth not some fake loveliness i hope the kids will not be hurt this is not their fault
4095939 after the recording we thought that lin miaokes voice was not very suitable
4095940 finally we made the decision that the voice we would use was yang peiyis
4095941 this is in the national interest it is the image of our national music national culture especially during the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important extremely serious matter
4095942 i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi
4095943 my voice was used in the performance i think thats enough

4095952 and while it would have sucked to have all those countries go red what we were really concerned about was india there are just too many people in india if they went red it would have been a brand new russia or china either way we didnt want to see it sadly history has proved us wrong but the logic was sound

4095957 you never found your weapons of mass destruction but your theory was sound its just
4095958 history has proven you wrong but the logic was sound
4095959 think that weapons of mass destruction are something that can fit in a truck you idiots honestly think that we went into iraq looking for an object when in fact the weapon of mass destruction was saddam hussein and his army
4095960 they invaded iran and a million died on either side two million dead they drained and destroyed the southern marshes and destroyed what could have been one of the oldest cultures in the world where the fuck are the marsh arabs gone they gassed the kurds they invaded kuwait waging a campaign of rape and murder and when they couldnt get what they wanted they set the oil fields on fire causing an ecological disaster the impact of which i shudder to imagine
4095961 did you ever stop to do the math and realize that less people are dieing since this

4095963 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4095964 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4095965 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4095966 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4095967 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4095968 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4095969 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4095970 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4095971 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4095972 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4095973 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4095974 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4095975 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4095976 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4095991 when the seventy two disciples returned they joyfully reported to him lord even the demons obey us when we use your name
4095992 at that same time jesus was filled with the joy of the holy spirit and he said
4095993 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss

4095999 so maybe later on in the campaign lets have a back and forth about who has comments or statements now lets devote all our energy to helping resolve a situation which is fraught with human tragedy
4096000 theres a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience that doesnt compare between the two on russia policy
4096001 you cant compare a 15 year historical record to three or four statements over the course of 15 months
4096002 we cannot act on the basis of ideology or preconceived notions when this crisis began barack obama the administration and all of our nato allies took a measured and reasoned approach because we were dealing with the facts as we knew them
4096003 after the events of the past six days no one should wonder why countries on russias periphery so ardently seek the security guarantees alliance membership represents
4096004 what about the equally important component of training young people to be successful at work you cant just send a 14 year old to a job site and expect him or her to know how to work showing up on time receiving instructions and knowing how to ask questions are skills that need to be taught
4096005 zomg is the best book series ever its the new harry potter but with vampires

4096014 hey everyone helped out everyone made the u s great
4096015 not only are we going to have a relatively small workforce but also one thats more diverse
4096016 we need to become very concerned about getting the proper education track for those in the pipeline
4096017 the challenge for policymakers is to make sure that especially for children they have all the opportunities and resources they need to become productive adults
4096018 more and more of the hispanic population is going to be native in the future
4096019 these are people who have grown up here gone to american schools and grown up speaking english
4096020 employers need to be mindful and aware of these changes and implement workplace policies that are non discriminatory
4096021 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
4096022 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
4096023 worries are far behind you theres even peace of mind too

4096034 ahhh im so tired and i have recurring stomach aches
4096035 theres a big bug with really long legs its right there
4096036 you were only in this ladys presence in order that you could help her and you did precisely the opposite
4096037 if it wasnt for the courage and good sense of one of your colleagues this would have been swept under the carpet
4096038 im talking about the impotence and inability of both europe and the united states to be unified and to exert leverage and to comprehend the level of the threat
4096039 he was saying its a difficult situation he said their tanks are 40 kilometers from tbilisi this is where we are
4096040 i think it was presented as you need to sign on to this
4096041 my guess is it was presented as this is the best i can get
4096042 we got some of our old strength back people started to respect us again
4096043 if that guy does not understand the situation well have to go farther
4096044 i go grocery shopping on wednesdays and clean house on thursdays
4096045 i feel the house is more together because she has the time to do things like in depth cleaning and can be more attentive to the garden
4096046 she also has more time to find good deals at secondhand stores garage sales and at grocery stores
4096047 all i do is take care of the house and yard do the shopping and the cooking serious honey works his butt off and i have all this free time because all i do is the things i used to do when i was working only now i dont have to go to an office
4096048 sh deserves to come home every day to a clean house clean clothes in his dresser a hot home cooked meal and me happy to see him that is what i try to do
4096049 if my wife had had that attitude i wouldnt be divorcing her

4096053 the temporary failure of an item of clothing to do its job in covering a part of the body that it would be advisable to keep covered
4096054 the new words we added to this 11th edition of the chambers dictionary paint a vivid picture of current interests and concerns
4096055 corso will definitely strengthen our team and he will fill an important role within our system
4096056 he is fast and a very good all round player
4096057 it is an indication of the strength and quality of australian higher education that we perform so well in world class competition
4096058 in the future we can expect to see chinese universities bulking larger in the top 200 and then the top 100 as the hyper investments in research and development of the past 10 years begin to bear fruit in stellar research performance
4096059 full funding of research currently under discussion is very important because it means research no longer has to be subsidised from resources generated by local and international students

4096064 met belangstelling heb ik de vista praktijkgids gelezen inmiddels heb ik een dell desktop met vista business edition uk deze pc maakt onderdeel uit van een thuisnetwerk met daarin een laptop twee printers en een tweede dell desktop met xp professional uk
4096065 tot nu toe stelde ik altijd belangrijke bestanden veilig door deze via het netwerk te kopi ren van de ene pc naar de andere en omgekeerd hoewel dat altijd goed is gegaan is het een bewerkelijke en foutgevoelige methode de komst van de vista pc leek me een mooie gelegenheid om mijn back uproutine beter op te zetten in de vista praktijkgids staat een stukje over het veilig stellen van bestanden via vistas backupcentrum naar aanleiding daarvan ben ik dieper op de back upfunctie ingegaan maar ik ben tot de conclusie gekomen dat back uppen niet past bij mijn methode van werken er wordt er namelijk vanuit gegaan dat je op n pc werkt en dat automatisch veiligheidskopie n worden gemaakt op een andere pc een server een andere disk intern of extern of een cd of dvd mijn familieleden en ik met werken echter soms op de ene pc en soms op de andere dat veronderstelt dat de bestanden en de folderstructuur op beide pcs gelijk zijn die gelijkheid wordt niet bereikt door de back up maar mogelijk wel door de synchronisatiefunctie ik kom er niet goed achter of wat ik wil mogelijk is en hoe een en ander moet worden opgezet de windows helpfunctie gaat namelijk uitsluitend over het synchroniseren van laptops op een server mijn vraag is daarom of u in computer totaal aandacht wilt besteden aan het opzetten van een omgeving waarin folders en bestanden tussen twee gewone pcs met vista en xp kunnen worden gesynchroniseerd vooropgesteld dat dit mogelijk is
4096066 youve got to go back to 1982 in the midst of the stagflation that followed the second opec oil shock to see the last time american inflation was clocked at that kind of pace for any sustained period
4096067 i cant wait till the new lower prices take effect
4096068 our chief economist meant that 6 is too high its a bad thing not something to get happy about
4096069 on my calculator the inflation on those prices is between 100 and nearly 400 where does this rubin guy come up with a measly 6
4096070 cpi no longer meant consumer price index but something more like con artists purloining individuals out went simple measurements and in came substitution hedonics and other wizardry for example the venal vacillators kept the cpi low by assuming that consumers would switch from steak to chicken if the price of the red meat got too high soon moreover it was decided that food and energy should be omitted entirely because their prices are too volatile its all utterly bogus
4096071 everything thats because they would have you believe that inflation is generated by greedy businesses and employees who ask for raises when in fact it is the fed and congress that are the culprits since we went off the discipline of the gold standard congress can spend as much as it likes and the fed can print as much money as it wants and boy do they its those mountains of new dollars chasing a lesser amount of goods and services that are the real root cause of inflation
4096072 they just piggyback on the governments numbers and add a dash or two to make it look like they are being independent
4096073 es una pena porque como todo el mundo vio jefferson estaba en muy buen momento pero conf o en la fuerza del resto del equipo para superarlo
4096074 la sentencia contenida en la resoluci n del 12 de julio del 2008 que declara fundada la acci n constitucional de h beas corpus presentada por pelayo miranda ch varri
4096075 nulo el extremo que ordena el archivo definitivo de la investigaci n preliminar
4096076 los agentes de la dirandro continuar n su trabajo para esclarecer este caso relacionado con el narcotr fico
4096077 la acci n de h beas corpus se ha convertido en un arma peligrosa que se usa indebidamente para sustraerse de una investigaci n fiscal eso no se debe permitir
4096078 est n siendo prostituidos por los aparatos legales para frustrar una investigaci n preliminar y hasta un proceso
4096079 hay que estar alertas para que no sigan prosperando estas resoluciones aberrantes
4096080 a maioria das pessoas n o tem boa vontade para fazer o trabalho duro que necess rio para tornar a venda f cil
4096081 toda vez que voc visitar um cliente pergunte porque ele acredita em voc na sua empresa e no seu produto
4096082 o velho ditado de vendas diz eu disse que ele abandonou os velhos ditados de vendas quando tudo igual as pessoas v o querer fazer neg cios com os amigos e mesmo quando as coisas n o s o iguais pre os qualidade etc os clientes preferem fazer neg cios com os amigos

4096087 ein spitzenkandidat der nicht bereit ist nach der wahl verantwortung zu bernehmen ist nicht nur unglaubw rdig sondern auch eine w hlert uschung die klar durchschaubar ist
4096088 die k rntnerinnen und k rntner haben jetzt die wahl entweder sie stimmen f r einen bz spitzenkandidaten der nicht einmal bereit ist nach der wahl in den nationalrat einzuziehen oder sie entscheiden sich f r den liberalen rudi vouk einen engagierten k mpfer f r rechtsstaat und grundrechte der sich auch nach der wahl f r k rnten im parlament einsetzten wird
4096089 die g tezeichen sind eine best tigung f r berdurchschnittliche laborleistungen und beweisen die hohe analytische qualit t die im lkh labor erzielt wird
4096090 das labor ist zu einer schl sselstelle f r alle medizinischen abteilungen des hauses geworden die sich rund um die uhr auf eine rasche und qualitativ hochwertige analyse der angeforderten parameter sowohl im bereich der klinischen chemie und immunologie wie auch der gerinnung und h matologie verlassen k nnen
4096091 die allmachtsphantasien des bz machen auch vor dem k rntner gesundheitswesen nicht halt sollen nun doch auch hier orange g nstlinge eingesetzt werden um die chaospolitik des bz zu sichern welche dazu f hrte dass k rnten zum wirtschaftlichen schlusslicht sterreichs wurde
4096092 es kann nicht sein dass angehende studierende vom studium abgehalten werden nur weil er oder sie bei der anmeldung auf eine kopie eines dokuments vergessen hat
4096093 buchstabenklauberei und das starre festhalten an verordnungen ist in einem solchen fall absurd

4096102 punch and judy went through the doldrums a few years ago and you dont see so many shows on beaches and street corners
4096103 we get a lot of negative publicity you have got to get permission from the council but some councils dont want shows it is just political correctness
4096104 but it is making a comeback up until this year people have always gone abroad for their holidays but now there is a big increase in staying in this country

4096111 right now in the us in particular we have a really strong concentration of the industry
4096112 so a lot of people are really concerned about this do we really want all of our traffic all of our editorial control of the internet all being piped through one two or three companies
4096113 i dont think we do i think we want to have a broader marketplace than that
4096114 all of the existing search engines are proprietary black boxes
4096115 you have no idea how things are ranked and whats going on
4096116 been very very intelligent about understanding the new media and actually involving people in new ways
4096117 i actually think this is something that is going to be really really important for a lot of politicians
4096118 i dont know exactly whats going to happen but i am generally optimistic because i see that ordinary people actually do love to engage with the issues and actually talk about things in detail
4096119 these people are very irresponsible they have disrupted the peace and order of the city and must be condemned
4096120 we are pumping gas again into the south caucasus pipeline
4096121 the baku supsa pipeline remains suspended for the time being it goes through the middle of the country
4096122 its a different route from scp so were still assessing the security implications and that remains suspended
4096123 while the conflict in georgia may have been the main source of attention for us the most significant supply event was the attack on the btc line in turkey and the implication that it may continue to be a target and one the length of which makes it virtually impossible to defend comfortably
4096124 recent escalation in military engagement between russia and georgia poses a threat to certain key oil and gas pipelines which transit georgia
4096125 do you think that a dead mans plea can still be reviewed by a court it is unconstitutional
4096126 the story of our people is your story mahmoud and by our meeting it was made more complete and more beautiful
4096127 you remain with us mahmoud because you represent everything that unites us
4096128 the flag he raised so high with his poems will one day fly high over the minarets of jerusalem its churches and walls the eternal capital of our inevitable palestinian state
4096129 given the recent nature of the cats death and where it was found it is reasonable to assume that those responsible for the two murders also killed the cat
4096130 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4096131 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4096132 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbour occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4096133 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
4096134 buddy theres no easy way to say this so im just going to spell it out arif you have only six more months to live were in the middle of august six months later this year say end feb you will breathe your last its not a might its not maybe but you will breathe your last breath in the end of february i thought it best that i tell you that now then you finding it out later im really sorry arif i strongly recommend getting all your affairs in order now
4096135 oh son it seems as if i have just closed my eyes and opened it amp my entire life can be fitted in that minute time frame
4096136 oh come on mum youre over 50 years old fifty whole years you are married with two kids one of whom whos married there were so many ups and downs during life earlier we were based in dubai now weve moved to india so much has happened so many memories does it really seem so short
4096137 oh it seems so short only and keep talking in a few years you too will see how short life is
4096138 what if you had only six months to live what would you spend your maximum time doing
4096139 building internal competencies which enable you to maintain a sustainable competitive advantage
4096140 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns
4096141 what theyre proposing is to create the worlds biggest airline with american airlines
4096142 but we know what dominant players do they snuff out competition they raise prices and they become even more dominant
4096143 it was ricky who helped make history in the house of pain
4096144 personally i think ricky has proved himself as south africas leading scrumhalf
4096145 is it fouries world cup status that now elevates him above ricky in my view fourie has done nothing to justify a place in the starting lineup
4096146 conrad jantjes is on present form the no 1 fullback it is worrying that people make decisions with their heart to give someone montgomery his 100thttest cap
4096147 i know peter wants to win the tri nations but he must realise he will be measured according to his ability to transform the team and to make it representative of the countrys population for the 2011 world cup
4096148 we have also seen nothing of the new type of rugby that peter has spoken of
4096149 it is interesting that coloureds and blacks traditionally support the all blacks when they play at newlands
4096150 is the team that has been selected of such a nature that it will ensure the support of most south africans
4096151 we cannot repeat the cycle of the white era we must build for 2011
4096152 it is easy to fall into a comfort zone peter should be reminded of his mandate
4096153 its not all about transformation but it transformation is an important part of it not one black player has let south africa down this year
4096154 south african coach peter de villiers said overnight that habana shoulder and burger neck were being rested ahead of the home leg of the tri nations
4096155 we are definitely going to miss bakkies hes a special player i think bakkies plays in his own way but i will bring my own physical edge to the game
4096156 but im really happy im starting against the all blacks at newlands what more can i ask for
4096157 i see the game as a big challenge especially now with bakkies out if i dont step up this weekend i think i will have ruined my chances to start again so its a big one for me
4096158 i think they are a more well rounded side now i think they have improved a lot since they lost to australia and of course richie makes a huge difference
4096159 i think fitness is starting to play a big role now under the new laws especially with the quick taps we run more and especially for the locks we have to tackle more
4096160 im quite happy with my fitness weve done a lot of fitness work during the last week

4096167 but we know what dominant players do they snuff out competition they raise prices and they become even more dominant

4096169 we cant travel without passports theres no point in any case the plane has left and tsvangirai has already gone back he has no patience for this
4096170 a galion man agreed to meet someone in lancaster to buy some construction equipment but it was all a set up to a robbery
4096171 there was a verbal agreement of 7 000 cash for the bobcat and the customer showed up with the cash and found out it was actually a robbery ambush
4096172 he was in fear for his life he felt that he was going to be shot and killed and he actually did pull his gun and shot several times at the robber
4096173 an east price hill delicatessen owner took matters into his own hands during an attempted robbery on tuesday police said officers said two men walked into dons deli on beech street just before 8 p m and pointed a gun at the owner demanding money instead police said the owner pulled out his own gun and fired at least once at the men who fled from the deli the men were last seen leaving the area in a tan sedan no arrests have been made so far
4096174 beware of what the democrats are saying about guns in their party platform a second amendment group says
4096175 utopian fantasy that gun control laws will somehow make neighborhoods safer
4096176 while promising to preserve our second amendment rights the party platform demonizes semiautomatic sport utility rifles and wants them banned calls for anti gun show legislation and proposes so called common sense gun laws
4096177 boiled down all it really means is that the democrats are still the party of gun control no matter how they try to re package the rhetoric
4096178 that was the first game in the super 14 and lots of things have changed since then by the end of the competition it was much better
4096179 it was all about a mental change and we had to accept it which we have now done i suppose the initial resentment was because the boks had just won the world cup under the old rules and we thought why would you want to change but now we are coming to grips with them
4096180 all tests against new zealand old rules or new rules will always be a tactical battle with lots of good kicking needed we saw how jimmy cowan and dan carter kicked for the all blacks in the last test against australia but with the elvs there is always room for a little bit of everything
4096181 its a very big compliment to receive that from coaches of that calibre you cant really read much into it though that was probably based on last years form all i want to do is work my way into my best form and to make the best decisions for the team
4096182 lord jesus i repent of all my sins come into my heart and be my lord and saviour
4096183 a novel that since its publication in 1932 has probably been read by only two people namely james wood and joseph roth

4096185 yeah i know it sounds crazy but i think we can make it work
4096186 drive ahead of my actual position because only the brakes worked immediately
4096187 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4096188 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4096189 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town
4096190 do multiroom systems just do mp3s what about my cds
4096191 s vejo o meu umbigo e quero falar sobre ele
4096192 the cheapest car to run is the car you already own
4096193 id like to explain how a dashingly youthful 59 year old came to be driving a geezermobile in the first place
4096194 fords panther line of cars which consists of the crown victoria lincoln town car and grand marquis is designed with the fuel tank located outside the protection of the rear axle and within the cars
4096195 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4096196 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4096197 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf
4096198 the vermont college writers community is so caring and the faculty amazing you cant help but dig in
4096199 it seemed like there was an unmet need in two situations
4096200 recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs and we had children dying whose family wanted to donate and we werent able to do it
4096201 it is a much more common scenario today that it would have been even five years ago
4096202 in my opinion its an open and shut case they dont have irreversibility and they dont have death
4096203 as difficult as that was to hear this opportunity provided us with a ray of hope
4096204 at that point zachary was so sick we did have him at home but we knew it wasnt much longer
4096205 hes just a crazy little kid who loves to play and swim and throw rocks
4096206 a r ssia n o pode amea ar seus vizinhos ocupar uma capital e sair impune
4096207 similar but similar enough that they could probably slip this into a cable re airing of

4096211 a lot of younger people go to the site and its amazing that they hear songs today that originally were recorded 75 years ago its pretty cool that people get to listen to this stuff as far as copyrights apparently im okay because nobodys come to shut me down or anything

4096232 the knife violence in britain has reached epidemic proportions according to an article at dailymail co uk an online news agency in england americans recognize the sensational headlines and use of the term epidemic to describe the actions of common criminals because of articles by the u s media that use the same format but vilify guns instead of knives the nature of this type of news reporting makes it obvious they are used to sway public opinion against guns or knives or the use of self defense by the average citizen when britain outlawed guns and self defense their elected officials claimed that the impending domestic tranquility would make them the envy of the world

4096307 in a cooling device besides temperature change you also need to know how much heat it can absorb from places you need to cool
4096308 in a ceramic atoms are more rigid so its harder to move them
4096309 atoms can be moved in polymers much more easily using an electric field so the electrocaloric effect in polymer is much better than ceramics
4096310 in a cooling device a voltage would be applied to the material which would then be brought in contact with whatever its intended to cool the material would heat up passing its energy to a heat sink or releasing it into the atmosphere reducing the electric field would bring the polymer back to a low temperature so that it could be reused

4096341 please just start anywhere in the circle here at my left will do
4096342 well i hate to go first but in answer to your question um professor i figured we lost it for good sometime during the state of emergency
4096343 id have to say 1968 maybe 1967 if you look at the co statistics they had a good chance to choke it all back right there and they knew full well they were screwing the environment there was definitely revolutionary potential in the period and even some political will but they squandered the opportunity in the drugs and the marxism and the mystical crap and they never regained the momentum nineteen sixty eight definitely ive said enough
4096344 im with ed on that one except there was one last chance in 1989 too maybe even as late as 91 after the first gulf war well that one was actually the second gulf war strictly speaking but after they blew their big chance at genuine new world order in 89 and 91 they were definitely trashed ive said enough
4096345 well you hear this question quite bit of course call me romantic but i always figured 1914 the first world war i mean you look at that long peace in europe before the slaughter and it looks mediation might have had a chance to stick and if we hadnt blown most of the twentieth century on fascism and communism and the rest of the ism bullshit maybe we could have built something decent and besides no matter what janey says art nouveau was the last really truly decent looking graphic art movement ive said enough
4096346 late 1980s there were some congressional hearings on global warming that everybody ignored also the montreal accords on chlorofluorocarbons they should have passed those with some serious teeth about co and methane and things would be a lot better today still heavy weather probably but not insanely heavy late eighties definitely ive said enough
4096347 maybe its just me but i always felt like if personal computers had come along in the 1950s instead of the 1970s everybody would have saved a lot of time well never mind
4096348 i think they blew it with the league of nations in the twenties that was a pretty good idea and it was strictly pig stupid isolationism on the part of the usa that scragged that whole thing also the early days of aviation should have worked a lot better kind of a real wings over the world opportunity a big shame that charles lindbergh liked fascists so much ive said enough
4096349 nineteen forty five united nations could have rebuilt everything they tried too some pretty good declarations but no good follow through though too bad ive said enough
4096350 im with joanne on the 1940s thing i dont think humanity ever really recovered from the death camps and hiroshima too after the camps and the bomb any horror was possible and nothing was certain anymore people never straightened up again after that they always walked around bent and shivering and scared sometimes i think id rather be scared of the sky than that scared about other human beings maybe it was even worth heavy weather to miss nuclear armageddon and genocide i wouldnt mind discussing this matter with you later professor logan but for the meantime ive said enough
4096351 me if i gotta blame somebody i blame columbus five hundred thirty nine years of oppression and genocide i blame columbus and that bastard who designed the repeating rifle youd never find an f 6 on any plain that was still covered with buffalo but ive said this before and ive said it enough
4096352 funny thing but i think the french revolution had a very good chance and blew it europe wasted the next two centuries trying to do what the revolution had right in its grasp in 1789 but once you stumble into that public execution nonsense hell that was when i knew the regime had lost it during the state of emergency when they started cablecasting their goddamn executions give em to madame guillotine and the revolution will eat its young just as sure as hell yeah put me down for 1789 ive said enough
4096353 i think we lost it when we didnt go for nuclear power they coulda designed much better plants than they did and a hell of a lot better disposal system but they didnt because of that moral taint from the bomb people were scared to death of any kind of radiation even when a few extra curies arent really dangerous id say 1950s when the atomic energy people hid behind the military security bullshit instead of really trying to make fission work safely for real people in real life so we got all natural co instead and the co ruined everything ive said enough
4096354 i think its fruitless to look for first causes or to try to assign blame the atmosphere is a chaotic system humanity might have avoided all those mistakes and still found itself in this conjunction that begs the question of when we lost control of our destiny we have none now i doubt we ever had any
4096355 only more so i mean if you look back at the glacial records for the eemian period the one before the last set of ice ages there were no people around to speak of and yet the weather was completely crazy global temps used to soar and dip eight nine ten degrees within a single century the climate was highly unstable but that was a completely natural state and then right after that most of europe asia and america were covered with giant cliffs of ice that smashed and froze everything in their path even worse than agriculture and urbanization and a lot worse than heavy weather is now im real sorry that we did this to ourselves and that were in the fix we are in now but so called mother earth herself has done worse things to the planet and believe it or not the human race has actually had things worse
4096356 an online petition signed by thousands is asking the university of san diego to again change its position and re invite
4096357 upon review of the specific purpose of the monsignor john r portman chair in roman catholic theology the university of san diego is no longer considering the appointment of dr rosemary radford ruether as the 2009 2010 chair holder
4096358 the petition in support of ruether was sponsored by the
4096359 a national organization that works for catholic women to be priests and for a more inclusive roman catholic church
4096360 aisha taylor the new executive director of the womens ordination conference
4096361 many of those signing the petition said that usd had lost status in the academic world by dis inviting ruether because it signified a violation of academic freedom or worse gender discrimination
4096362 some of the signers identified themselves as faculty members at usd
4096363 i am a member of the department in question the administration made an end run around the faculty half of whom are out of the city and simply made a decision without consultation with the department of theology and religious studies it is a first in the long history of administrators working with our department
4096364 ruether has said she thinks that god can be called
4096365 an arm of the abortion lobby in the united states and throughout the world
4096366 christianity is not necessarily worse than other religions but it is the vehicle of western civilization
4096367 in regard to faculty members at catholic colleges universities i wish to reaffirm the great value of academic freedom in virtue of this freedom
4096368 teachers and administrators whether in universities or schools have the duty and privilege to ensure that students receive instruction in catholic doctrine and practice this requires that public witness to the way of christ as found in the gospel and upheld by the churchs magisterium shapes all aspects of an institutions life both inside and outside the classroom divergence from this vision weakens catholic identity and far from advancing freedom inevitably leads to confusion whether moral intellectual or spiritual

4096373 theres no educational crisis in the north east of england
4096374 it cant be all down to the government or all down to schools parents have a huge role to play in raising the aspirations of children
4096375 schools have a much bigger job to do in getting good a level results where parental aspirations are low
4096376 i had personal experience of low aspirations of parents in much of the north east not all of the north east
4096377 theres nothing like parental aspiration for improving childrens a level results if you could quantify it i have no doubt that would be the major factor
4096378 teachers and heads in many parts of the north east have to work much harder to raise the aspirations of their students when they are working against a background of low parental aspiration
4096379 there are plenty of parents in london and the south east that have low aspirations for their children but maybe a higher proportion in the north east

4096402 the problem with running a campaign thats based on cult of personality is that cracks in the grandiose facade of obamas life become very damaging
4096403 thats where you can get a readers attention and have substantial impact
4096404 is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited
4096405 the reality is there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off a presidential campaign
4096406 the book is going to change a lot of opinions
4096407 its a different version of the man than hes been presenting
4096408 this is an attempt to perpetuate those politics for four more years
4096409 one of the reasons i wrote this book is to keep obama from getting elected
4096410 as it became clear that he was going to win the democratic nomination for president it seemed irresponsible to stand by as so many were offering admiration piety even worship to of all things a politician because the idea of barack obama as a reformer is a great lie

4096502 they seemed to know exactly what they were looking for
4096503 it was very demeaning to have such a negative experience in what is billed as a friendly country people in the group including the tour guides were quite shocked no one had ever heard that jordan imposed religious restrictions
4096504 what made it worse was that the whole thing seemed to be directed solely at jews i saw christians walking through into jordan openly wearing crosses apparently christian religious symbols did not seem to be a problem for the jordanians i can well imagine the international outcry if islamic tourists were to encounter such restrictions on their entry into israel

4096521 chinese citizens in accordance with the law enjoy the freedom of speech and other kinds of rights and freedoms
4096522 its clear to us that the protest zones are just a cynical public relations ploy on the part of the chinese authorities
4096523 we can see that the petitioners who made this attempt to speak have now suffered the consequences

4096541 you can get the grades but thats just a piece of paper im glad i could show them that id sick with it and not drop out which is something a lot of unis unfortunately experience
4096542 i didnt have an interview but i think it would be a great way of sorting out the people with high grades it lets the university people get a vibe and feel the students passion if its there
4096543 itd be scary probably but worth it after all this is something thats going to affect your whole life if its something you really want to do youve got to jump at every chance to show that
4096544 shes an immensely talented and gifted young lady hard working and everything a student should be just a pleasure to teach
4096545 we cant take it for granted even in katarinas case but shes shown all the character and determination which i think theyll be looking for and shell get the chance to show that when she goes down there for interview
4096546 whatever is happening i dont think it is attributable to rogue elements
4096547 in any intelligence service especially for covert operations you often try to maintain a level of deniability so that the top decision makers are not fully informed about what is going on
4096548 there are still huge differences between the military and the politicians as to how to combat terrorism what to do about it the military is really controlling the policy the civilians dont have much of a say
4096549 this is one of the reasons why pakistan has not been able to fight the war on terror decisively and why there are so many differences with the americans on this not everyone is reading from the same page
4096550 formally the director general of the isi reports to the prime minister the director general of the isi however is a three star general appointed by the chief of army staff who reports to the president the eight departments of the isi are headed by eight two star generals who are chosen by the director general of the isi and the budget comes out of the defense and intelligence budget which is not subject to civilian review in pakistan
4096551 so while formally the isi reports to the prime minister the control is effectively lodged with the military
4096552 now how that actually works that is who finally makes decisions i dont know
4096553 isi is heavily manned by people from the armed forces so it is not an organization which is a purely civilian organization
4096554 it would be correct to say that it has not been controlled really by the prime minister the way it should be technically and constitutionally it is under the control of the prime minister but operationally speaking and substantively speaking the prime ministers have not really even strengthened the defense cabinet committees
4096555 as the isi stands today it pretty much doesnt function under these kind of parliament related civilian controls
4096556 past that period the isi strategy that has flowered the training that was given was really essentially
4096557 and the tools the assets that were developed by the intelligence agency were subsequently used to reach the goals of pakistans own security interests and for battling pakistans own security threats as perceived by intelligence agencies in pakistan
4096558 this country has been under military rule quite a lot when it has been under military rule one section of the isi has been used by military rulers to engineer the political situation in the country
4096559 and for that it has earned a very bad reputation
4096560 internally obviously there has always been a big question that we need to have an organization which reports to the executive and the reporting lines are stringent and there is oversight thats the concern within the country
4096561 there has been an effort in the past under general musharraf the question of growing a nexus between the executive authority and the isi so that there is unity of command general musharraf has been very keen that the intelligence agency would come completely under his control
4096562 now the question of course is with an elected government how do you arrange this control of the isi
4096563 diese medaille bedeutet mir nichts ich wollte hier gold holen
4096564 ich denke meine niederlage im halbfinale war total ungerecht die strittigen regeln zeigen dass die fila nicht fair handelt
4096565 now its kind of down but weve got a great leader in moose the panthers as we have mentioned in the past are dying to find a wide receiver and returner
4096566 you cant help but think he wont be here for long hes on the same path as a mike tomlin hes not a guy whos going to stick around and wallow in the same job for a long time
4096567 i know where my check down receivers are at all times and thats something i didnt fully understand last year
4096568 it would be one less thing to worry about or even think about were getting closer closer than we have been so thats a good sign that were taking steps in the right direction
4096569 id still like to wait but im not ruling him out
4096570 ill know more today because were going to work on our list and just talk those things through it may be just a pregame deal again where he gets ready and we shut him down

4096730 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat

4096768 we take the slightly more optimistic opinion that the economy will improve by the end of the year
4096769 the decline reflects a backlash from the strong first quarter as well as a cyclical economic downturn
4096770 high oil prices the euros strength and the weakness in global demand are all clouding the outlook
4096771 its bound to be the case that there is the possibility of a quarter or two of negative growth
4096772 they have taken our passports this is a reflection of their insincerity they want to talk to us yet they behave like hooligans
4096773 the less you have to do on the site but more time you have to waste on it
4096774 we wish marlon all the best he is a good pro and he made a contribution last season
4096775 he has worked hard in pre season and has made an impact but he has chosen to move on for the time being
4096776 america is focused on china right now and its good for all of us
4096777 the first thing we always think about is are we serving our viewers and customers and we unequivocally are
4096778 that makes so much sense why hadnt i thought of that before
4096779 once again our students have demonstrated what can be achieved with determination enthusiasm and good teaching and learning
4096780 results for science and maths are especially strong as reflects our specialist school status
4096781 its the largest number of students we ve ever had taking a levels and the success rate s been fantastic everyone s done really well
4096782 it has been an exciting and encouraging year for the shcool particularly since it was my final year
4096783 i couldnt believe it when i opened them up i was quite confident but i wasnt sure what i was going to get i worked really really hard
4096784 these arrests are a significant development in our fight against the organised criminal gangs responsible for this type of fraud
4096785 chip and pin remains the safest method of payment for goods and services and in the unlikely event a cardholder is an innocent victim of this or any type of fraud they enjoy excellent protection under the banking code which means that they will not suffer any financial loss
4096786 because ive been there done that ill be able to relate to the housemates in a more empathetic way because i can imagine what theyre going through at that point in time
4096787 sincerely regretted the level of offence caused by events in this series
4096788 im not racist but i can see why it has had the impact its had
4096789 i am sorry for the hurt and pain that my actions caused
4096790 there are silly ways of criticizing works by cls scholars and there are intelligent ways
4096791 a complex and subtle depiction of a highly irregular conceptual terrain
4096792 george shers book is a comprehensive and constructive account of our pre reflective intuitions of desert
4096793 although i realize it has become a clich to praise a book by saying that it should be required reading i believe that from now on those who would write on desert either pro or con or who would presuppose some notions of desert in their writings on other topics have an obligation to study shers book
4096794 this is a most timely intelligent well written and absorbing essay on a central and painful social and political problem of out time
4096795 the major achievement of this remarkable book is a critical theory of nationalism worked through historical and contemporary examples explaining the value of national commitments and defining their moral limits
4096796 as this century staggers to its balkanized end it is harder than ever to believe with mazzini that liberal principle can be reconciled with nationalism or that national liberation can ever have liberal results
4096797 tamir constructs a philosophical ideal of nationalism but in leading the reader to questions such as this she also performs a valuable service for those who try to understand its reality
4096798 one hopes that her argument here will lead liberal states to reexamine their obligations to all citizens of the world not just those within their borders
4096799 yael tamir has made an important theoretical contribution to a crucial debate that should interest anyone trying to come to terms with contemporary politics
4096800 tamirs case for a liberal nationalism would save liberalism from a shallow universalism and save nationalism from its darkest impulses
4096801 simmons densely argued and heavily referenced work he reveals deep knowledge of both the primary and secondary literature and overturns many a famous name in a footnote provides us with a powerful analysis of what is probably the central moral concept of lockes political philosophy namely his theory of rights
4096802 simmons succeeds triumphantly in showing that the issues are still alive and that even if locke cannot solve our problems he has much to contribute to an understanding of them
4096803 anyone who thinks philosophical debates are irrelevant to the problems of the real world should read this book
4096804 the best writings on hobbes have always been those that boldly sought to unify the warring elements in his thought
4096805 se i miei bambini volessero far carriera nello showbusiness non glielo impedirei ma preferirei facesso altro nella vita e avessero uninfanzia normale

4096811 mackenzies daddy makes books and he has eighty people working for him
4096812 well mackenzies daddy makes books and he has eighty people working for him
4096813 i want to hear the answer to this myself ive often asked myself what it is you fellows do exactly campbell thats an excellent question
4096814 well honey bonds are a bond is well let me see whats the best way to explain it to you
4096815 i must have done five thousand leveraged purchase contracts and i always fell asleep before i could figure out why anyone wanted the bonds
4096816 a bond is a way of loaning people money lets say you want to build a road and its not a little road but a big highway like the highway we took up to maine last summer or you want to build a big hostpital well that requires a lot of money more money than you could ever get by just going to a bank so what you do is you issue what are called bonds
4096817 you build roads and hosptials daddy thats what you do
4096818 daddy doesnt build roads or hospitals and he doesnt help build them but he does handle the bonds for the people who raise the money
4096819 yes just imagine that a bond is a slice of cake and you didnt bake the cake but every time you hand somebody a slice of the cake a tiny little bit comes off like a little crumb and you can keep that
4096820 or you have to imagine little crumbs but a lot of little crumbs if you pass around enough slices of cake then pretty soon you have enough crumbs to make a gigantic cake
4096821 no not for real life you just have to imagine that
4096822 im not sure youre making it any clearer for campbell

4096835 i really have to find out what is the time limitation for pulling someone off a ticket you cant tell someone that morning the morning of the meeting usually you give a two week notice to someone if youre going to fire them from the job
4096836 its just a vindictive thing because i had a couple good meetings and i think thigpen feels that way because he didnt do it first

4096840 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4096841 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4096842 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed

4096849 to call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mind set that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past

4096855 we recognize that in america this is going after somebody who is more comfortable with technology
4096856 the truth is that in other countries its becoming a part of their culture the trend is coming and as a fashion company its very important to identify trends and get ahead of them
4096857 this is about someone whos interested in our brand and interested in technology and wherever the two meet thats whats appropriate
4096858 youll see us work in practice on turning the ball over and creating scores on defense
4096859 but its not reasonable to think youre going to score 12 times on defense
4096860 its not a goal we stress its something that just happens
4096861 if the defense needs to go for the big hit you go for the big hit if it needs a big play you go for the big play
4096862 you have to understand the defense and know when you can be aggressive and when you have to be safe
4096863 sometimes coach lambert allows the corners to be aggressive it depends on the defensive play call and offensive play recognition

4096897 no great movement designed to change the world can bear to be laughed at or belittled mockery is a rust that corrodes all it touches
4096898 yikes he cant deal with the fact that he has a hump i in danger of humiliating him not by making fun of the hump but merely by stating that i noticed that he has it if i insist that he really has a hump he might humiliate me by insisting that my name is really frankenstein that would be intolerable oh well if he is deep enough in denial to say what hump maybe i can just move on and we can just pretend nothing happened here and ignore all these lies and misconceptions and proceed

4096909 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
4096910 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
4096911 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers

4096927 there is a powerful human impulse known as the rule of rescue to attempt to help an identifiable person whose life is in danger no matter how much it costs
4096928 nice recognises that when it is making its decisions it should consider the needs of present and future patients of the nhs who are anonymous and who do not necessarily have people to argue their case on their behalf the institute has not therefore adopted an additional rule of rescue
4096929 we would be opposed to ignoring a rule of rescue when it introduces a degree of flexibility around extreme cases so what if you waste a few pounds if you are doing your best for humanity
4096930 were convinced that belmonts opportunity to host the 2008 town hall presidential debate is also a nashville opportunity it presents a valuable and unusual opportunity for colleges and universities in nashville to draw their students attention to the privilege and responsibilities of citizenship the your voice your choice event kicks off belmonts year long celebration of debate related programming under the theme the art of being free and it also marks the beginning of focused student voter registration campaigns and collaborative programming at educational institutions across the city
4096931 cmt one country is proud to partner with belmont university to urge students and nashville residents alike to register to vote and make their voices heard with this your voice your choice concert

4096933 it is such a surreal feeling to look behind the bus and see semi trucks with my name on them

4096935 autism has become part of the national dialogue and with so many families either directly or indirectly affected by this disorder we believe this storyline will truly resonate with night shift viewers
4096936 we are pleased to be working with autism speaks to ensure that the experiences and information we convey are factually accurate and truly reflective of the experiences and emotions real families are dealing with every day
4096937 night shift viewers will see a very realistic portrayal of the emotional trauma families face when their child is diagnosed with autism but they will also see how a sense of hope and determination eventually brings those families closer
4096938 we applaud night shift for tackling this issue and helping to foster greater understanding and compassion for families affected by autism
4096939 its fantastic to be on setanta sports again and fighting in such a massive fight against roy jones jr
4096940 its no secret that this will probably be my last fight so what better way to go out than by fighting one of the best fighters of the past 25 years and at madison square garden too so its fantastic
4096941 theres just over 12 weeks to go now so ill start serious training from monday on
4096942 so im really looking forward to the fight its going to be a tremendous night and i want to go out and make sure i fight a brilliant fight
4096943 i wasnt that happy with my last fight the win over bernard hopkins styles make fights that that clash didnt make for a good fight
4096944 but roy jones doesnt like to hold and i dont like to hold so i think that therell be fireworks
4096945 there are always question marks but as long as i go out and produce a performance and win this fight well then ill feel like ive achieved everything i want to achieve in boxing
4096946 its a mistake many fighters make just fighting for the money they eventually get beaten but how many fighters retire undefeated very very few
4096947 you play a virgin in the light but need no urgin in the night
4096948 disperse anyone standing in a large group drawing attention to themselves
4096949 thirteen of us braved a downpour to sing give readings and contemplate hiroshima as we do every year
4096950 we were hassled by staff for being in an area allocated to fringe activity we explained our understanding that it is a public gathering place we were careful not to form an obstruction
4096951 they said that it was for performers only we pointed out that there was not a performer in sight because the area was awash with rainwater
4096952 its totally over the top the mound is a traditional public place for speeches and protests
4096953 i will be asking serious questions of the snp lib dem administration about this unacceptable attitude as it is they who in the end have responsibility for this
4096954 weve basically been told to disperse anyone standing in a large group drawing attention to themselves
4096955 if anyone wants to organise an event on the mound or the high street during the fringe all they have to do is contact the fringe office in advance
4096956 the fringe holds a temporary public entertainment licence so that everyone can enjoy the fantastic fringe atmosphere in a safe and organised manner our stewards manage the performances spaces and timetable all the outdoor action over the festival so everyone who wants to take part gets the opportunity to do so
4096957 this is an unfortunate situation but the cnd did not give notification of their event to the fringe or to the council and as a result were asked to move a few feet
4096958 if however the cnd would like to gather at any time in the future we will be able to accommodate them and inform them of any diary clashes that might occur

4096961 si no lleva a cabo una singular rebaja del impuesto de sociedades

4096964 movie fans in australia and new zealand can choose from a great selection of over 700 films for purchase and rent on the itunes store
4096965 itunes provides an incredibly easy and fun way for people to discover and enjoy movies and has quickly become the worlds most popular online movie store with customers renting and purchasing over 50 000 movies everyday
4096966 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4096967 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4096968 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4096969 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4096970 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4096971 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4096972 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4096973 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4096974 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4096975 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4096976 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4096977 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4096978 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4096979 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4096980 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4096981 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4096982 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4096983 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4096984 who are open to doing something on the production side
4096985 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4096986 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4096987 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4096988 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4096989 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4096990 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4096991 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4096992 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4096993 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4096994 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4096995 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4096996 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4096997 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4096998 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4096999 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4097000 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4097001 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4097002 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4097003 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4097004 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4097005 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4097006 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4097007 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4097008 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4097009 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4097010 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4097011 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4097012 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4097013 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4097014 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4097015 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4097016 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4097017 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4097018 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4097019 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4097020 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4097021 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4097022 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4097023 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4097024 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4097025 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4097026 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4097027 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4097028 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4097029 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4097030 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4097031 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4097032 police booked his ticket from ho chi minh city to london and i have already paid for the ticket on his behalf
4097033 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4097034 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4097035 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4097036 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4097037 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4097038 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4097039 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4097040 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4097041 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

4097043 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4097044 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4097045 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4097046 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4097047 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4097048 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4097049 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4097050 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4097051 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4097052 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4097053 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
4097054 i think hes undisputedly the greatest swimmer of all time
4097055 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
4097056 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
4097057 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
4097058 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
4097059 he is not from another planet he is from the future

4097076 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4097077 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4097078 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4097079 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4097080 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4097081 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4097082 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4097083 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4097084 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4097085 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4097086 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4097087 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4097094 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4097095 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4097392 its fantastic to be on setanta sports again and fighting in such a massive fight against roy jones jr
4097393 its no secret that this will probably be my last fight so what better way to go out than by fighting one of the best fighters of the past 25 years and at madison square garden too so its fantastic
4097394 theres just over 12 weeks to go now so ill start serious training from monday on
4097395 so im really looking forward to the fight its going to be a tremendous night and i want to go out and make sure i fight a brilliant fight
4097396 i wasnt that happy with my last fight the win over bernard hopkins styles make fights that that clash didnt make for a good fight
4097397 but roy jones doesnt like to hold and i dont like to hold so i think that therell be fireworks
4097398 there are always question marks but as long as i go out and produce a performance and win this fight well then ill feel like ive achieved everything i want to achieve in boxing
4097399 its a mistake many fighters make just fighting for the money they eventually get beaten but how many fighters retire undefeated very very few
4097400 to get out undefeated means more to me than money it will be my last fight
4097401 to be honest hes one of my favourite ever fighters hes a tremendous fighter a four weight world champion what hes achieved is incredible
4097402 obviously he had a few defeats against tarver twice and glen johnson but he came back like all great fighters do and proved a lot of people wrong including myself
4097403 hes had three good wins including an excellent win against trinidad so this is redemption for him and believe me hes going to come into this fight with a tremendous will to win
4097404 we believe that this will save substantial sums of money that we now spend on police details
4097405 i advocate federalism as a way to gain lasting peace in mindanao
4097406 this concentration of such enormous powers in manila has created only one center of finance and development in the country resulting in a highly centralized system of government
4097407 is the absence or utter lack of consultation of stakeholders including christian leaders indigenous peoples in mindanao and peace advocates themselves
4097408 contravenes the very essence of any peace process which is participative of the stakeholders
4097409 there is nothing in the track record of this government that says it can be trusted with amending the constitution
4097410 nothing it can be proposed in the committee in the plenary
4097411 we must disassociate the principle of federalism from any rumors of term extension for the president
4097412 21 positions are being eliminated in the austin office of ncsoft in the area of product development primarily this is related to products which we have not previously announced and were in prototype phases
4097413 experiments indicate that the advantages of these devices are such that human operators will be greatly enhanced for things like photo reconnaissance and so on
4097414 bringing down inflation from the current high levels and stabilising inflation expectations assume the highest priority in the stance of monetary policy the rbi said in its quarterly review
4097415 there is an understanding between the pakistan peoples party led coalition and musharraf on the president resigning before impeachment proceedings begin in earnest against him
4097416 that concepts such as human rights democracy and science are historically linked together through similar foundations and assumptions
4097417 all nonscientific systems of thought accept intuition or personal insight as a valid source of ultimate knowledge indeed the egocentric belief that we can have direct intuitive knowledge of the external world is inherent in the human condition science on the other hand is the rejection of this belief and its replacement with the idea that knowledge of the external world can only come from objective investigation that is by methods accessible to all
4097418 a debate is a competition of minds in which contestants must counter one another with arguments designed to persuade their peers
4097419 dissent is the mark of freedom as originality is the mark of independence of mind and as originality and independence are private needs for the existence of science so dissent and freedom are its public needs

4097428 iraq was an unjust war based on false pretences and every soldier who refused to fight probably saved a lot of lives
4097429 this cowardly attack on unarmed aid workers yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent
4097430 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
4097431 they were driving in a land cruiser with a clear irc logo on it
4097432 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
4097433 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community help the poverty hit afghan people
4097434 reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted in this way
4097435 nothing can justify such an attack on people whose lives are devoted to helping the people of afghanistan
4097436 humanitarian workers should be protected by the principles of neutrality and impartiality and must not be targeted as they appear to be at present in afghanistan
4097437 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
4097438 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001
4097439 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups

4097449 the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century
4097450 we had to go or there would have been shooting
4097451 i dont know how they are going to isolate us
4097452 to show to russia that we can come to the aid of a european ally and that we can do it at will whenever and wherever we want
4097453 we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
4097454 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4097455 we were unhappy with the initial actions of the american officials because they were perceived by the russians as green lines basically but this one was very strong
4097456 we wont be protecting the airport or seaport but well certainly protect our assets if we need to
4097457 to continue our efforts to rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4097458 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can invade its neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4097459 if he doesnt understand the situation well have to go further
4097460 he doesnt seem to understand that the russian army is much stronger than the georgian army his tanks remain in their places his air force is dead his navy is also his army is demoralized
4097461 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states
4097462 but one day the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership
4097463 to leave it in such a condition would be unforgivable
4097464 russias ongoing actions raise serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
4097465 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century the united states has supported those efforts now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
4097466 i dont think that theres any doubt that russia has already in its actions called into question some of its desire to be integrated into these institutions
4097467 if iive virtuously all around me will be all right

4097486 to call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mind set that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past
4097487 this matter of kashmir is not indias internal affair it is as much a matter for pakistan as it is for kashmiris
4097488 when everything seems to be going against you remember that the airplane takes off against the wind not with it

4097494 the volumes of deals with shares included in the index representing list on august 14 compared to the previous trading day in kzt climbed by 28 9 and amounted kzt100 3 million usd835 1 thousand
4097495 frankly we were blown away by both the volume and quality of the names that were submitted
4097496 g8 st was one of the most popular suggestions plus we noticed a far broader trend toward simple easy to remember names
4097497 in the end we felt it was more appropriate to honor the el caminos unique place as part of chevys heritage and not use that nameplate on a pontiac
4097498 today we are celebrating the start of a new era for our fabulous ford motor company
4097499 the all new fiesta is an outstanding symbol for our one ford vision of a single global company designing and building cars for customers around the world be proud of what you have achieved and be proud of your contribution to a model that will get the world talking
4097500 the fiesta is special to us in ford of europe and to our customers
4097501 over the past 32 years it has consistently been at the top of the list of europes best selling cars
4097502 while appealing to existing customers the new vehicle will attract a new generation of fiesta owners with its dynamic bold design and high manufacturing quality
4097503 i am confident that the all new fiesta will build on the success of its predecessor
4097504 were proud of the cologne assembly plant and the vehicles produced here not only does the new fiesta bring innovative design and engineering to the small car market but it brings new manufacturing technologies as well
4097505 this new fiesta is tough strong and safe due to the body construction technologies which allow us to build a lightweight yet extremely strong body through the innovated use of high strength steel it is also built with care craftsmanship and precision by an efficient and dedicated workforce which is second to none

4097517 the ioc does disapprove of any attempts to hinder a journalist who is going about doing his job seemingly within the rules and regulations
4097518 this we hope has been addressed we dont want to see this happening again
4097519 the three parks being opened is based on the constitution of china that people are allowed to demonstrate if they have some issues
4097520 i think thats one step further for china to open up and i think its a very good gesture
4097521 after 30 years of reform china has developed greatly people enjoy more freedom they have a lot of say their economic welfare has improved greatly they are happy
4097522 but some people come to be critical to find fault with the small details but that does not mean we are not fulfilling our promises

4097525 donations received through conservative campaign headquarters used to support my office in my capacity as shadow secretary of state for children schools and families from harris ventures limited
4097526 we will make schools accountable to parents by allowing parents to choose the school they want for their child well give every parent the right to take the money currently allocated to their childs education and then deploy it in accordance with their priorities not the governments
4097527 the tories want to move to a swedish style system whereby most schools are independent
4097528 make sponsors reticent in engaging in the expansion of the programme
4097529 instead they were retained in the pierce county evidence room and were allowed to be removed by police officers and taken home for viewing

4097532 move forward secure in the knowledge that the images of these events were behind her and had been destroyed
4097533 police officers employed by the city of tacoma could not simply take the pornographic images home for their viewing
4097534 no systems procedures or protocols were in place or followed to protect victims of child sexual abuse from having these images viewed by others or brought back at later dates
4097535 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
4097536 not at the level expected from a silicon valley startup
4097537 only very large enterprises could afford it and it was hard to justify paying those prices for a product that simply automated what developers could already do for themselves with free tools
4097538 when i go into sites i would love to turn them on to the benefits of the testng test framework
4097539 but most organizations do so little unit testing if any that i stick with the simple well known xunit tools so as not to create confusion most organizations are just not ready to learn anything more than basic unit testing if that
4097540 the problem with unit testing is that it increases the cost of development before you know whether what you developed is what you needed afterwards when you have a working solution theres little interest in writing unit tests as what you have works and your management wants you to move on
4097541 many developers and managers mistakenly think that by cutting testing they well get feature x out faster what they dont realize is that you are robbing peter to pay paul
4097542 i am extremely concerned about the reports of illegal activities taking place at this albuquerque nightclub

4097544 my favorite spot at wawel hill is the dragons den legend has it that a dragon once lived in the cavern below the castle the kings son krakus fed him breakfast of sulfur hidden in cattle skins to rid the kingdom of the beast

4097555 rules governing economic transactions are the most important causal determinant of the incidence and depth of poverty in the modern world

4097557 were not trying to start a chapter of the guardian angels
4097558 but we feel that some of the things that they do some of the things we might be able to find out from them should help us either to recognize problems or to give us an idea of what we can do
4097559 we get a good response even from the kids just by being there
4097560 i cant go to a guys house and arrest him
4097561 if you start calling the police on these kids they dont want to listen to you
4097562 we have nothing to be proud of in terms of building democracy going slowly is fine as long as we are moving in the right direction but we are not just going slowly we are moving in the wrong direction
4097563 it is principally impossible to preserve democratic rhetoric and authoritarian style management for a long time we have a democratic fa ade just to demonstrate it to the west
4097564 dont think that the people here are not prepared to compromise and talk
4097565 georgia is changing its approach we understand that isolating abkhazia will only make matters worse and push them into the hands of the russians
4097566 within the georgian state but with a vast amount of autonomy
4097567 we must spare no effort and mobilize all our internal resources
4097568 we georgian patriots people who love their motherland people who have a special sense of pride and dignity we will certainly achieve our cherished goal
4097569 the political elites are supported by washington and this helps to keep them in power and arrests democratization
4097570 a bit more pressure from the united states and the american media would go a long way
4097571 we know how to change behavior and attitudes that is what we do
4097572 we know what messages will work and what will not
4097573 people know outside is going to feel much better for them but underpredict how happy theyre going to feel after being outside in nature even 15 minutes
4097574 the people inside overestimate their happiness about being inside its this error in judgment people have about how happy they are in a different environment that may explain why people dont spend more time in nature
4097575 rather than changing their ways to protect the environment the results of this study suggest that these people may give up on their efforts to protect the environment
4097576 i think most people recognize we face a severe environmental crisis but its hard to deal with that head on because most people feel helpless to do anything about it
4097577 if we look at the nature of the problem it is so big its hard to know what any individual can do in their own life to make a difference
4097578 the tendency when people are confronted with an overwhelming problem is to run away from it so psychologists are very experienced in dealing with that
4097579 one of the first things you think of is turning off lights when you leave a room or changing the thermostat settings in the house they dont think first of caulking windows or upgrading your furnace
4097580 more insulation in the attic and tight windows make more difference than changing the thermostat setting having a more fuel efficient car makes more difference than any amount youre likely to decrease driving
4097581 people showed strong approval for other students who recycled you would hope to see people disapprove of people who dont recycle but they didnt disapprove
4097582 we are recognizing that environmental problems have a tremendous impact on many aspects of our lives but we need a lot more work
4097583 we cant afford to let this increased environmental concern become just another fashionable trend

4097592 je vous demande de laisser de c t votre avis personnel et darr ter d tre sourd vous le pouvez si vous tes le pr sident de tous les fran ais
4097593 das war ganz klar unangemessen aber soweit wir wissen hat sich das team entschuldigt
4097594 komm geh wieder dran du kannst immer noch eine ganz gute punktzahl bekommen
4097595 nein ich denke wir sind wirklich deprimiert davon wie langweilig wir wirklich sind und wie unaufregend selbst die schlimmsten fabrikationen und bertreibungen sind wenn man die liest nichts scheint da wie rock amp roll also finden wir das etwas traurig da es wahrscheinlich bessere geschichten gibt die ber uns und die branche bzw das medium geschrieben werden k nnten keine haie groupies oder massig kokain oder irgendwas spa iges berhaupt wir kommen da wie zornige deppen r ber was vielleicht wahr aber sicherlich nicht sehr aufregend ist

4097605 i didnt do what i wanted to i couldnt use any of my techniques i have nothing left
4097606 if i step onto the tatami again i may probably be thrown again im really empty now
4097607 ill go home amd closely look back at myself and what i have been doing thats what i would do first
4097608 if i feel like doing it again i may start with running or something like that but for now i am empty
4097609 i could see he was trying to tackle me on the inside from the very beginning and i intended to stop him from tackling me
4097610 having said that i think its fool who is thrown down again
4097611 no he didnt ive improved only in the last year
4097612 i know i was feeling down after the relay but i didnt want to get beaten
4097613 it really affected my performance because the rain made my gun slippery and i missed several targets
4097614 we stood up well because we were so young in the middle of the park
4097615 of course for a game of that level you could be worried but i have confidence in them and i must say i have been paid back very well
4097616 we expected a difficult game and we were not disappointed they man marked us all over the pitch and we needed to be patient and not make any mistakes at the back
4097617 we changed a bit tactically at half time but most important they dropped their level a bit to do what they did in the first half to tackle for every ball is of course very difficult and from then on we looked a bit more comfortable
4097618 its a massive mountain to climb its bigger than everest but we take heart from the performance
4097619 i said before that this game isnt just about now but also the future i like what i see of this team we showed we are a good team who can compete with the likes of arsenal
4097620 we go away thinking 2 0 is an unbelievable result because of the performance we put in
4097621 thats what happens in europe against the top teams the inexperience in the dressing room showed and we have to learn from it but i cant fault the performance we had arsenal rattled especially in the first half
4097622 with income being squeezed in so many ways those looking to raise some extra money may find that their spare room could provide the answer demand for rooms is likely to be fairly high too and with the government providing tax free incentives for landlords now is certainly a good time for those considering taking in a lodger
4097623 we have just enough religion to make us hate but not enough to make us love one another
4097624 edwards is running for president on moral values his wife has been diagnosed with cancer and yet this is a man that were going to trust of leading the free world thats why this is an issue

4097658 as a few mobile experts are starting to point out twitter could have charged heavy users a premium bundling package to recieve their twitters via sms
4097659 in europe there is mainstream adoption of premium sms services so introducing charges would not have deterred too many twitter users
4097660 in many respects twitter took off in the uk precisely because it had an sms service

4097665 one of the top 25 film festivals worth the entry fee
4097666 we had films screened and filmmakers attend from all over the world
4097667 audience feedback has been equally strong a clear indication that we were able to achieve the right programming mix of course this is only due to the exceptionally strong films submitted to the festival so the kudos really belong to the filmmakers who made this years event happen we also had an exceptional staff in place that was filmmaker centric and worked together as a team making a clear difference in how this festival was produced
4097668 we have improved customer traffic and ticket and overall sales growth in our markets

4097677 i saw the vargas sisters come on they competed on the brazilian olympic team we are not in their league at all
4097678 dr von madd must have seen something in us he liked
4097679 i think we were invited because were infamous not because were any good
4097680 when has that ever stopped us look weve been kicked out of the georgia beach volleyball association were not playing competitive beach volleyball at all this summer were stuck on the sidelines i dont know about you but i find that fucking depressing

4097693 im over the moon to come out of college and find yourself on rte i never expected it
4097694 definitely the broadcast media is want i wanted it reaches so many more people and it always appealed to me
4097695 i was doing my thesis and one of the lecturers in college got an e mail from rte who were looking for a presenter reporter for news2day so i lashed off a cv and thought no more about it
4097696 then i was called for an audition then another audition and then told i got the job it was brilliant
4097697 it is important that people who are in the whole of their health think of those who are less fortunate and are sick in bed particularly when those who are sick are children
4097698 if whitewater were really serious about this proposal they would have submitted the information before now
4097699 lets not talk about that and just hope it continues
4097700 we got good hitting both games and really good pitching
4097701 our bullpen came in and did a good job what else can i say
4097702 we were behind 4 0 by the second inning both games
4097703 its frustrating to play so poorly today we just didnt do anything good
4097704 i apologized to him and i apologized to my teammates
4097705 i told him that hes one of our leaders here and theres no reason for that
4097706 weve got pitchers who can do that to the other team too
4097707 they do that to us why cant we do that to them
4097708 you have to live with that stuff its been around since the beginning of the game
4097709 because of the downturn in the building sector there is less demand for slates and we have sufficient stock made to last for the remainder of the year
4097710 we are continuing to work with the unions in order to find a possible solution and deal with the issues we are now faced with
4097711 the desecration of such a sacred monument that means so much to the families of the deceased is a despicable act of vandalism and one that must be condemned
4097712 it must be devastating for families when they visit a loved ones grave and discover it has been vandalised in such a heartless way
4097713 it is definitely the lowest you can go when you go and do something like that
4097714 i am extremely concerned that this theft of information could cause anxiety to our customers particularly our pensioners i am also very concerned that this volume of information was put on a laptop
4097715 i view the loss of information and time very seriously
4097716 i t is the policy of the council not to permit development within this aap area which is not in accordance with this plan
4097717 would be premature pending the preparation and adoption of the action area plan and if permitted would be contrary to the proper planning and sustainable development of the area
4097718 is contrary to the future development of a coherent and strategic urban structure plan
4097719 it is considered that the proposed development has not been addressed within the context of an action area plan and would therefore appear to be premature pending the preparation and adoption of the action area plan and if permitted would be contrary to the proper planning and sustainable development of the area
4097720 is contrary to the future development of a coherent and strategic urban structure plan
4097721 it is considered that the proposed development has not been addressed within the context of an action area plan and would therefore appear to be premature pending the preparation and adoption of same
4097722 any proposals layout and design for the site will be therefore be required to form a successful part of an overall final action are plan being prepared for the area
4097723 kildare town is experiencing substantial leakage of customers to other nearby centres due to inadequate retail provision in the town
4097724 is compatible with the development of the rest of the aap site and can be successfully integrated into the overall emerging vision of the aap area
4097725 accordingly the proposed development would materially contravene the development plan
4097726 the site is located in an area zoned town centre with the objective of providing for multi use two to three storey development with a strong urban form the proposed single storey monofunctional development with extensive surface car parking as a dominant feature of the layout would not accord with the zoning objective and would be contrary to the proper planning and sustainable development of the area
4097727 while the back to school clothing and footwear allowance bscfa does contribute towards some of the costs the payment is still not reflective of the true costs of uniforms and footwear
4097728 the bscfa is aimed at families in need yet the income guidelines governing eligibility results in some families in low paid employment particularly lone parent families being ineligible
4097729 a lot of people would not necessarily have sat down and planned for it and it is only when they actually get to the shops to buy the pieces that they realise the cost of it
4097730 there is another issue that has crept in the peer pressure that is put on children and parents
4097731 they should sit down with the child and explain that this is the situation this is what we have available
4097732 the fact is that people have to realise that everybody has a choice
4097733 we actually start planning about four or five months in advance
4097734 every year i think theres a little bit of things that are unforeseen that i think helps us prepare better for the years to come
4097735 i am disgusted and shocked at the councils request i feel we have been misled by the officials and i am calling on the council to resolve these issues immediately
4097736 the development in its current format would be detrimental to the urban fabric and structure of athy in order to reduce the bulk and scale of the development it is recommended that two floors are omitted along the new street and one floor along the pedestrian route
4097737 furthermore in relation to the architectural treat ment revised elevations should be submitted which provide for a more ordered and coherent expression and avoids an arbitrary variety of styles
4097738 arent you glad you got at least half of my genes
4097739 there is no answer there never has been an answer there never will be an answer that is the answer
4097740 godfrey nwodo has all of the ingredients to be a 2008 fight of the year candidate
4097741 this show has the equivalent of two main events with godfrey nwodo and borquez remillard borquez is a champion coming here from mexico with 17 knockouts in his 18 wins fighting a young undefeated champion in remillard add heavyweight jason estrada the 2004 u s olympian along with some of the top new england prospects on the undercard and we have a great overall card from top to bottom
4097742 this is a big fight for me to get back into the cruiserweight championship picture
4097743 ill also be defending by nabf belt on espn nwodo is tall and he has a lot of power hes a little one dimensional but has a lot of experience i know that im going to be in a tough fight
4097744 mr client we spent most of your billable time this week forging relationships with key media
4097745 every day i am deluged with hundreds of pr pitches they come from everywhere startups big companies competing pr firms and occasionally from people inside edelman where i work i read all the emails but delete 99 99 of them i dont even respond i feel bad about it but theyre so off base i cant even begin to tell you how bad they are
4097746 we are here to serve the media not the other way round
4097747 we have to make sure that companies and products are easy and a joy to discover thats no easy feat further it means giving up control however in a google age where self discovery rules its becoming a must
4097748 all the mawassi people used to work in the settlements and make good money now there is nothing to do even our own agricultural land is barren
4097749 perceptions of which foods should be eaten in moderation and an understanding of balancing a diet appear to be weak
4097750 we know that families in some communities still use the corner shop on a daily basis for their food and household goods
4097751 it is therefore essential that we take healthy eating options to these stores and reach those families who are at the greatest risk of poor health due to a poor diet
4097752 this basic intervention implementing a household smoking ban has the potential to promote antismoking norms and to prevent adolescent smoking
4097753 adolescents are faced with so many influences that contribute to smoking attitudes and behaviors to find that a simple household rule that bans smoking in the home has a meaningful impact on smoking attitudes and behaviors is somewhat surprising
4097754 this study provides evidence that even in a smoke free home environment parental behavior remains a strong influence on teen smoking attitudes and behavior
4097755 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
4097756 joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat

4097851 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
4097852 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated
4097853 i am concerned when there are comments made about the misuse of taxpayer money
4097854 a comment was made that our fire trucks are left idling when they exercise but that has not happened since i became chief also the rec center is approximately one mile from downtown and in an emergency situation it would take only a minute or two to get to our station downtown not four minutes
4097855 firefighting is very labor intensive and a lot of firefighters die of heart attacks and i want them to be in the best shape possible
4097856 i dont think i would be doing my job if i didnt encourage them to work out
4097857 they need to be able to climb ladders and carry a person out of a fire if necessary
4097858 if thats the case i want them to be in the best shape possible
4097859 they go through a respiratory test every year and staying in shape is something that is part of their job
4097860 sure it would be great if we had the facilities to work out at the station downtown but i dont feel the rec center causes any problems
4097861 we had it looked at and there is a possibility that some of it can be saved and if thats the case then it will not cost us as much but were not sure about that
4097862 but our best estimate on the cost is around 20 000
4097863 it would be dire because it would be a very chilling effect on volunteers which is what many many of our small communities rely on to provide fire services
4097864 we were begging for more help the whole time and they wouldnt do nothing about it

4097879 although by the second century ad the elephant headed yak a form exists it cannot be presumed to represent ga apati vin yaka
4097880 he is a non vedic god his origin is to be traced to the four vin yakas evil spirits of the m navag hyas tra 7th 4th century bce who cause various types of evil and suffering
4097881 clearly refers to b haspati who is the deity of the hymn and b haspati only
4097882 we cannot resist to accept his full identification with this vedic dantin
4097883 the references to the elephant headed deity in the maitr ya sa hit have been proven to be very late interpolations and thus are not very helpful for determining the early formation of the deity
4097884 it seems likely that the core of the ganesha purana appeared around the twelfth and thirteenth centuries

4097899 the new words paint a vivid picture of current interests
4097900 weve been watching words like wag for a long time but we dont want words that are ephemeral or just the buzz words of the moment

4097907 as far as we are concerned there was no obstacle in the process we did not bribe anybody we applied like others and submit our proposal when the biding was opened we were announced as the winner the process had been most trans
4097908 what really helped me was to travel to a lot of the agencies and to see all the kids and all the adults given a chance because of united way and the resources that so many people give
4097909 i even took our team to some of the agencies
4097910 i want to encourage you all to come watch us this year and support our team
4097911 this year well finally have to start doing what we probably should have been doing all along thats carpooling not having so many cars going trying to ride together
4097912 thats more of a concern with the kids getting their homework done because theyre going to have to be leaving at 3 oclock and getting home at sometimes 11 oclock or midnight
4097913 so we dont because of the conference changes have students leaving the school any more than when they were in the badger overall we were able to work things out where the early releases would be about the same from last year
4097914 im hoping our spartan pride will carry through and support all our sports on away games but im sure it will have a factor in the travel especially with fuel costs i think that might be the single biggest factor when youre paying 3 75 to 4 a gallon to travel thats going to be a factor for some families
4097915 it puts us with teams that are more evenly matched with student athlete enrollment
4097916 were a division 3 football team and were playing against division 3 team
4097917 the balance of teams were going to be playing in conference and out of conference is a little better size wise than what we had before
4097918 a school of 650 kids is only going to have so many kids that want to play football
4097919 a school of 1 500 kids is obviously going to have more athletes or student athletes to choose from
4097920 you kind of have the same crop of kids to pick from
4097921 theres no doubt that in high school athletics a lot is based on rivalries
4097922 one thing we look forward to is making new rivalries
4097923 we have more than 300 students in sports out of 650 right now and we have sports that the rock valley doesnt offer so were in the badger conference for those
4097924 it the shares now trades at a premium to peers and with no specific catalyst in view we expect a period of share price consolidation

4098013 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4098014 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4098015 either ridge or sen joe lieberman would be a transformative vp pick who could help open up the republican party and deliver moderate voters and independents some mccain advisers believe mccain is seriously weighing that option sources say
4098016 but its a tough calculus a pro choice nominee would infuriate the anti abortion element of the conservative base and potentially be a bitter divorce from the religious right

4098032 the development of these larger components along with their special handling and maintenance equipment is probably one of the most difficult and costly phases of msbr development
4098033 the salt valves for large msbrs represent another development problem although the freeze valve concept which was employed successfully in the msre could likely be scaled up in size and utilized for many msbr applications
4098034 requirement for remote maintenance will significantly affect the ultimate design and performance of the plant system
4098035 the removal and replacement of core internals such as graphite might pose difficult maintenance problems because of the high radiation levels involved and the contamination protection which would be required whenever the primary system is opened

4098096 were going to be non violent protesters going to confront a war machine the only people who could possibly recreate that situation is the denver police and we hope they choose not to
4098097 were not here to incite a riot or anything else

4098129 there were a number of animal studies suggesting that if you somehow could avoid the skin say by injections or orally you could induce tolerance to the resin
4098130 could roll around in poison ivy and not have problems
4098131 this one subject who had always gotten bad poison ivy every summer was sure that he had gotten the active pill
4098132 when the study was over and we checked to see whod gotten what we learned that indeed hed been on the placebo
4098133 i tell patients that the skin is armed and dangerous

4098144 were closely monitoring the situation but its unlikely to be cut as our rating has factored in the cyclicality of the industry
4098145 the agencys support argument is based on the companys strategic importance within singapores electronics and technology sector and prior track record of financial support from controlling shareholder temasek fitch said
4098146 based on the view that some form of financial support would be available from temasek should it be required
4098147 rating agencies form a view on the creditworthiness of companies they assess and they may make certain assumptions on what temasek might or might not do with regard to our portfolio companies temasek said
4098148 it is not our practice to comment on such assumptions made
4098149 oh no that would be completely wrong i profoundly disagree with them but i profoundly believe in their right to do it i think they have made the wrong judgment but i think it is right that they can that they are above me not me above them

4098193 la denominaci n de origen del pisco es nuestra as ha sido siempre

4098195 per trata de confundir a la gente diciendo que el producto chileno no se llama pisco han estado en una pol tica de intento de destrucci n de nuestro posicionamiento
4098196 el per tiene su nombre pisco por historia por legalidad y por cultura lo viene obteniendo en diferentes pa ses
4098197 aqu no se gana la legalidad del nombre pisco para ver quien exporta m s sino que por un tema de historia por legalidad y cultura en per el gran consumo de pisco se realiza ac el pisco peruano est a la altura en calidad de un co ac un brandy o un whisky nosotros no estamos en el orden de los destilados de ca a como los rones o aguardientes
4098198 nos gustar a que el pisco fuese puesto en el tapete de las negociaciones bilaterales chileno peruanas para darle una soluci n negociada
4098199 yo creo que somos pa ses hermanos y no podemos hablar de agresividades cada uno tiene su historia no es materia de una pol mica industrial ni comercial sino que a nivel de gobierno y canciller a se puede mejorar
4098200 el per tiene su uva ya que la calidad del producto del pisco peruano es por la calidad de la uva chile tiene otras caracter sticas de uva que hace que cuando los productos se destilan salen diferentes entonces no estamos entrando en el mismo mercado la destilaci n es diferente y tan s lo la regi n donde se cultiva y cosecha la uva peruana es diferente en suelos y en climas chile tiene un clima y sueldo diferente y se cosechan uvas diferentes y por ende el resultado es distinto
4098201 no hay que tomarlo de una forma de batalla sino que cada uno tiene su mercado y el tiempo dir que pasa hay pa ses que reconocen el pisco peruano otros reconocen a los dos

4098228 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4098229 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4098230 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4098231 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

4098281 nu172 has the potential to address many of the limitations of currently available anticoagulants given the profile we have seen to date in preclinical and phase 1 testing including its ability to produce rapid and predictable onset and offset of anticoagulation without the need for an antidote its potential ability to work in stagnant blood its predominately non renal clearance and the option to stop and restart anticoagulation as needed during or after surgery
4098282 because of these characteristics nu172 could potentially offer an improved approach to anticoagulation for procedures such as coronary artery bypass graft cabg surgery kidney dialysis and percutaneous coronary intervention pci
4098283 in this study we were able to identify a dose that meets or exceeds the level of anticoagulation needed for the indications we plan to evaluate including cabg surgery
4098284 in addition to supporting our previous proof of concept data the phase 1b study shows that anticoagulation with nu172 can be maintained for four hours which is longer than a typical cabg procedure we are on track to launch a phase 2 study evaluating nu172 in the fourth quarter of 2008 or the first quarter of 2009

4098295 the reason i had to write this book is the veterinarian choosing collegiality over fixing their vaccination protocols the legislation drafts are already written making companion animals living property rather than a couch which they are by law and also would be a deterrent to over vaccination through loss of companionship damages it all boils down to this over vaccination has caused physical and fiscal harm knowingly due to their business model and the failure of veterinary ethics

4098363 although by the second century ad the elephant headed yak a form exists it cannot be presumed to represent ga apati vin yaka

4098675 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4098676 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4098677 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades

4098682 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones

4098684 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4098685 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4098686 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos

4098691 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

4098836 the new york city food bank is a very important organization that deserves our attention and funding our short term goal is to raise 1000 for them by thanksgiving and we have long term goals that are still being discussed with the nyc food bank
4098837 were discussing a charity fund raising cruise which would take place during 4th of july week in 2010 aboard princess cruise lines what makes this special and unique is that we already have our pricing locked in and all people have to do is book this specific cruise through us and between us and princess cruise lines who will match dollar for dollar up to 50 per cabin that means we can make donations of up to 100 per cabin and we have 100 cabins secured so we can potentially raise 10 000 for the new york city food bank and that in turn can feed a lot of hungry needy people
4098838 its going to be a wonderful cruise we will be departing out of brooklyn ny and while the itinerary is tentative it looks like ports of call will include bermuda and several stops in the caribbean the best part is since we already locked in our pricing and have it under deposit our pricing for 2010 is lower than 2009 pricing
4098839 oh its gone off the screen now you must have missed it

4098842 i want to impact individuals in the way i am impacted spiritually in the best of all possible worlds i would like my work to bring comfort to others and help them move forward on their own spiritual journey
4098843 i spent my days as a child wandering main st in disneyland enjoying the magical world walt disney created
4098844 i have been blessed with the unique opportunity to create art that helps carry on the legacy and heritage of walt disneys dream my goal is to continue to impact the lives of both young and old with the magic i have been so fortunate to take part in
4098845 i like to mix photorealism with drips and texture it contradicts itself and works to the very end the organic and natural contrasts beautifully with the structure of the airbrush and photorealism its a nice marriage of techniques that gives the work more depth the effect is almost trompe loeil french for trick the eye which is an art technique involving extremely realistic imagery in order to create the optical illusion that the depicted objects appear in three dimensions this is especially true of the water drops on the flowers
4098846 i believe i bring the spontaneity of his chuck jones original drawing to the forefront of my paintings where the viewer can see the action up close the backgrounds reflect the age and use of the original drawings grounding them in history
4098847 i spent my days as a child wandering main st in disneyland enjoying the magical world walt disney created i have been blessed with the unique opportunity to create art that helps carry on the legacy and heritage of walt disneys dream my goal is to continue to impact the lives of both young and old with the magic i have been so fortunate to take part in
4098848 my personal style has emerged and i break down the composition into simple shapes with each shape having its own palette its a jigsaw puzzle of color to form an image
4098849 i keep the backgrounds simple so as not detract from the main focus and so i can concentrate on the details of the central image
4098850 alvin brings emotion into his artwork that can only be captured in an illustration we call it alvinizing
4098851 up until this point i had been painting trees with black gray and brown trunks and green leaves
4098852 and then i came across the fauves who were only in existence a few years and their intense use of color they had done something i really enjoyed and appreciated so i began to paint far more colorfully than i had in the past today i enjoy painting as much as ever and i enjoy doing things that are really colorful the great thing is that now with the giclee process of making prints you can match the colors perfectly
4098853 my artwork is meant to recall the beauty majesty and mystery of the life we live and the world we live it in painting the small delicacy of the light on a child s face or the overwhelming power and grace of the sky at sunrise is my attempt to capture some of that wonder through my work i hope to remind you and myself how truly wonderful complex and vivid life is whether we are looking into the eyes of someone we love or struggling just to breath life is a priceless gift

4098856 this new suit technology has a lot to do with it but its more than that

4098858 and i think each time a pool is built something is learned
4098859 this pool is 3 meters deep its an incredibly fast pool its got good gutters if you know what to look for you can tell even from tv its a fast pool
4098860 they are definitely hyper mobile and also have big paws and all of that helps
4098861 i think the world is getting faster but at the same time im really proud of what the u s is doing
4098862 it is something we stress in our program the sport is fast enough now where you need to pay attention to detail and you cant get away with mistakes they will catch up to you
4098863 i just think that the swimmers are getting bigger and stronger more flexible and their hidden training is better and better
4098864 its fun to see the innovations in terms of stroke technique and stuff come to the forefront its fun to watch what its producing
4098865 they are really talented its not necessarily just the swimsuits the lzrs the pool is fast because its deep its deep smooth water you dont have a lot of turbulence the swimmers are in great shape they are well trained the suits are very very very good the suits are very helpful
4098866 each quadrennial it does at the same time its a brutal sport

4098869 lo m s dif cil de separar el agua en sus componentes no es el hidr geno el platino funciona muy bien como catalizador con el hidr geno sino el ox geno ya que el platino funciona de forma muy poco eficiente con l lo cual obliga a usar mucha m s energ a
4098870 lo que hemos hecho es conseguir un catalizador para el ox geno que no necesite una adici n de energ a extra de hecho con nuestro catalizador casi se consigue emplear el 100 de energ a requerida por la electrolisis en descomponer el agua en ox geno e hidr geno
4098871 el xido de n quel no puede usarse en todas partes y mucho menos al aire libre por el peligro de corrosi n incluso el di xido de carbono en el aire reacciona con l para crear carbonatos
4098872 pero nuestro catalizador usa materiales abundantes que no reaccionan con el medio ambiente
4098873 como nuestro catalizador es ecol gico las m quinas que realizan la electrolisis pueden ser mucho m s baratas que las empleadas en la actualidad ya que no necesitan ninguna protecci n para evitar contaminantes medioambientales
4098874 los fabricantes de c lulas solares pueden a adir electrolizadores super baratos a sus sistemas para lograr que funcionen las 24 horas del d a durante el d a descomponiendo el exceso en hidr geno y ox geno y durante la noche recombin ndolos en pilas de combustible para generar electricidad

4098895 observers estimate that this year alone people will buy 32million digital televisions the old televisions will then get dumped in countries such as ghana
4098896 my research shows that about 90 of the computers are junk they just dont work they are obsolete not functional and they contain an array of toxic materials including lead mercury and brominated flame retardants and they are destined for disposal in their countries of origin but they are sent here where only about 10 are put to good use the rest go straight to the agbogbloshie dump site and other dump sites around the country where they contaminate ground water surface water the rivers and the streams this is simply dumping and nothing more

4098899 e waste exportation and dumping in ghana is a clear violation of european and international law it is simply prohibited to export hazardous wastes to non eu countries and there is the need for member states of the eu to better implement and apply european law on e waste dumping we have a responsibility to clean up because we shouldnt let this e waste to remain here for our future generation the impunity must stop

4099011 when hardworking taxpayers cant even get health care in california
4099012 you feel like youre in this deep dark hole and you cant get out
4099013 they talked to me and i remember that for the first time i didnt feel so alone
4099014 i felt so much better knowing that these folks had been through a similar experience and they were now helping others
4099015 i especially love working with patients in the emergency room and the crisis unit
4099016 you have a chance to have an impact on them right away sometimes we just sit with patients other times people want to talk about their pain and trauma i feel so privileged when people want to do that and that i can be there for them
4099017 their job is to provide support comfort hope and compassion to patients while they are in the hospital
4099018 their experience is unique someone who has been through a mental health crisis really has the ability to help someone else going through the same thing its a powerful message of hope and comfort
4099019 they might be hallucinating or confused the peer advocates can meet with them and give them companionship and comfort they have the time to spend with patients
4099020 its a biological disorder it doesnt mean people are weak it doesnt mean there is something wrong with who you are it just means you are challenged in that area people recover all the time
4099021 traditionally people with mental illness have been told they dont need to work or they are not capable of working
4099022 we are trying to increase the percentage of people in our community with mental illness who work even part time
4099023 its something people really struggle with especially people with depression it feels like hopelessness but the reality is that almost everyone will recover at some point
4099024 sometimes you go in and people will say no said kathleen
4099025 thats fine but when they start telling you their story i listen i try to listen more than talk
4099026 they have so much wisdom they teach me and hopefully i teach them
4099027 i saw i had something to offer and that i was good at it
4099028 it gave me a sense of purpose and encouragement that i could make a difference
4099029 it gave me back a whole lot more than i gave to the patients
4099030 this isnt a day we can celebrate but it is an important day and we need to get the information out
4099031 when you have to take somebody to dallas for instance for treatment you cant keep up constant care his family cant even keep contact
4099032 there are a lot of notions that this is the way college has to be this is the way ive planned on it to be my whole life
4099033 some people are quite vulnerable to depression but it doesnt emerge until the highly stressful years of separation and trying to grow into adulthood
4099034 kids with depression and anxiety disorders should be able to succeed with good treatment
4099035 i think its harder but it shouldnt be a block to their being successful

4099050 the lack of criticism of the fed tells you all you need to know it is the one sacrosanct institution because it is the most necessary institution to modern statecraft without it we wouldnt fund both welfare and warfare we wouldnt dream of a world empire and debate policy the way we debate art as merely a matter of preference there would be strict physical limits on what the state could and could not do

4099065 being 2 0 down in three and a half minutes the other day it was time to ante up and show what youve got in your locker
4099066 nach dem fulminanten jahresauftakt wurde die deutsche wirtschaft im zweiten quartal von der realit t eingeholt neben der generellen konjunkturschw che die derzeit in allen industriel ndern zu beobachten ist litt deutschland dabei unter besonders schweren umst nden die kumulierten sondereffekte die die wirtschaftsleistung von januar bis m rz um 1 3 expandieren lie en schlugen nun mit voller wucht zur ck
4099067 wir gehen davon aus dass es im zweiten quartal negative wachstumsbeitr ge vom privaten verbrauch und den anlageinvestitionen gegeben hat positive beitr ge d rften hingegen von den nettoexporten und dem staatsverbrauch gekommen sein
4099068 wir sehen die deutsche wirtschaft nach wie vor nicht auf rezessionskurs sondern gehen vielmehr davon aus dass die konjunktur nach der wachstumspause im sommerhalbjahr bereits im vierten quartal wieder fahrt aufnehmen wird hintergrund dieser einsch tzung ist die annahme dass sich die gegenw rtige korrektur beim lpreis weiter fortsetzt dieser preisr ckgang d rfte sich als regelrechtes konjunkturprogramm erweisen von dem vor allem der private verbrauch profitiert
4099069 die daten f r die wirtschaftsleistung im zweiten quartal liegen im rahmen der wenig optimistischen erwartungen der aufschwung in deutschland geht allm hlich zu ende 2 wachstum im gesamtjahr d rfte das maximum sein zudem besteht mit einem schwachen dritten quartal die reelle gefahr einer technischen rezession in deutschland
4099070 der konjunkturhimmel hat sich merklich verfinstert und die ersten sturmausl ufer sind mit schwachen exporten und einem wieder sinkenden privaten konsum in deutschland angekommen alles in allem stellt sich die konjunkturelle situation zur jahresmitte 2008 schlecht dar denn eine weitere schrumpfung der wirtschaftsleistung im folgequartal ist wahrscheinlich
4099071 die besten zeiten f r die deutsche wirtschaft sind vorerst vorbei f r unsere bip prognose von 2 3 in diesem jahr sehen wir nach den heutigen daten auf jeden fall ein abw rtsrisiko
4099072 alles in allem wird sich der abschwung der deutschen wirtschaft in den kommenden quartalen fortsetzen die risiken weisen klar nach unten mit 0 7 ist unsere wachstumsprognose f r 2009 vorsichtiger als die der meisten volkswirte
4099073 unter strich bleibt eine wachstumsdelle in diesem jahr unser hauptszenario das risiko einer harten landung hat auf kurze sicht aber zugenommen
4099074 nimmt man die ersten beiden quartale zusammen ist die wirtschaft der eurozone annualisiert um 1 und damit unterhalb des trends gewachsen besorgnis erregend ist das die fr hindikatoren auf ein noch schw cheres wachstum im zweiten halbjahr hindeuten eine technische rezession k nnte allerdings vermieden werden
4099075 trotz der j ngsten schlechten stimmungsindikatoren rechnen wir f r das dritte quartal nicht mit einem erneuten bip r ckgang sondern mit einer positiven verlaufsrate von 0 2 das hei t der euroraum wird unseres erachtens knapp an einer rezession vorbeischlittern unsere jahresdurchschnittsprognose f r das wirtschaftswachstum haben wir von bisher 1 7 auf 1 4 nach unten korrigiert
4099076 die wirtschaft im euroraum befindet sich am rand einer rezession zwar ist der r ckgang des bip teilweise eine gegenbewegung auf das durch sonderfaktoren nach oben verzerrte wachstum im ersten vierteljahr aber auch bereinigt um diese effekte hat sich das wachstum markant abgeschw cht
4099077 die stimmungsindikatoren deuten auf ein weiterhin schwaches wachstum hin auch ein neuerlicher r ckgang des bip im dritten quartal und damit eine rezession ist nicht ausgeschlossen auch wenn dies von uns im moment nicht erwartet wird
4099078 angesichts der abrupten abflachung des wachstums und einer inflation die ihren gipfel gesehen hat sind kurzfristige zinserh hungen durch die europ ische zentralbank vom tisch
4099079 basically the same bunch of goons and thugs theyve been for the last 50 years

4099085 the need is for a great foreign policy president of the quality of truman or reagan to win a long war begun by our enemies we are going to need more than an attractive but essentially empty vessel
4099086 america is no longer what it could be what it once was and i say to myself i dont want that future for my children
4099087 political pollsters would like us to believe theyve got a bead on voter preference for sen barack obama and john mccain with regard to who is likely to win the presidency in novembers general election this sort of thing is of course their stock in trade
4099088 the fact remains that the 4 to 10 point leads polls have been reporting for the last month or so dont mean anything with respect to the election and are far enough within the margins for error to give pause at this stage of the game acknowledging this even the overwhelmingly pro obama
4099089 it also appears and i tend to believe this based on reader mail that some savvy individuals who had leaned toward obama actually decided to do some cursory research on the candidate
4099090 that he is not what he seems has indeed become apparent to some likely voters to these he is becoming more transparent
4099091 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky and did i mention hes black
4099092 times new viking and no age are two bands that over the past year we ve attempted to stalk from as far afield as la s the smell austin texas and back to camber sands they are undoubtedly two of the best most exhilarating live bands in the world right now and to have the chance to tour on such a brilliant line up is as intimidating as it is exciting it promises to be incredible
4099093 well if youre heading towards a cliff do you want to be going 100 mph or 60 mph
4099094 to sit back hoping that someday someway someone will make things right is to go on feeding the crocodile hoping he will eat you last but eat you he will
4099095 life liberty and property do not exist because men have made laws on the contrary it was the fact that life liberty and property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first place
4099096 if you will not fight for the right when you can easily win without bloodshed if you will not fight when your victory will be sure and not too costly you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all the odds against you and only a small chance of survival there may even be a worse case you may have to fight when there is no hope of victory because it is better to perish than to live as slaves
4099097 if ye love wealth better than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom go home from us in peace we ask not your counsels or your arms crouch down and lick the hands which feed you may your chains set lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
4099098 no man thinks more highly than i do of the patriotism as well as abilities of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the house
4099099 for my part whatever anguish of spirit it may cost i am willing to know the whole truth to know the worst and to provide for it
4099100 is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received
4099101 we have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable but it has been all in vain shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication what terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted let us not i beseech you sir deceive ourselves longer
4099102 sir we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on
4099103 our petitions have been slighted our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult our supplications have been disregarded and we have been spurned with contempt from the foot of the throne
4099104 if we wish to be free if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained we must fight
4099105 they tell us sir that we are weak unable to cope with so formidable an adversary
4099106 sir we are not weak if we make a proper use of the means which the god of nature hath placed in our power
4099107 the battle sir is not to the strong alone it is to the vigilant the active the brave

4099122 that must be one of those fill in noun here s ive heard them talk about so much lately
4099123 do i have enough time to beat up the band
4099124 if were ever going to beat germany the time is now
4099125 weve lost two finals and a bronze medal to them and weve got to put a stop to that run
4099126 at this tournament though its not the germany that were used to so were a lot more confident
4099127 our problem at the moment is that we are very solid at the back and get a lot of possession but then we seem to give the ball away straight away
4099128 we keep fluffing our passes during the build up and a mere two goals in three games isnt much to write home about
4099129 its obviously a great feeling when you come on and are then involved in a goal
4099130 if i do get to start then i would of course be really pleased but thats up to the coach to decide
4099131 the chinese tell me that 8 is a lucky number which is why i had the tattoo done

4099134 swap prices have come down this week so we can pass on the benefits to hard pressed borrowers
4099135 not only are these best buy products they also offer 500 cashback and a free valuation and legal service for re mortgage customers
4099136 the west seems to be willing to give in instead of saying no were not going to be intimidated by violence were not going to kowtow were going to do what we believe to be right and were going to defend ourselves
4099137 in this case just the possible threat of violence no actual threats at all
4099138 it portrays ashia the nine year old girl as being very happy with the marriage to the 54 year old mohammed
4099139 maybe she was but there is a moral problem here and that is that child marriage has become very common in some areas of the islamic world in imitation of mohammed
4099140 were not here just to put up a good fight were here to win because winning is how the killing stops
4099141 positive step forward in establishing common ground that will lead to abortion reduction
4099142 some of these people youve mentioned and others that are like them trot around the country telling people theyre pro life and if we believe that and if we count on them when the time comes that we really need them then were going to be sorely misled and sorely let down
4099143 so i think that whats happening right now is that god is showing us who the people are that we can count on and obviously these pro aborts like the ones youre mentioning here are not people that can be counted on

4099150 they operation peace were very open to the idea of having this projects assistance and having computers play a role in the childrens education
4099151 at this point we cannot say for sure that we brought radical social change in these kids but we hope that we bridged the technology gap that exists between them and the rest of the world
4099152 you think of all these ideas then to have the students explore it for free and come up with some sort of product is super valuable especially for us with limited resources

4099156 we deny this the bank did not buy its shares on themarket
4099157 we believe one possible explanation is the bank buying itsshares from the market which if true would be positive in theshort term but could lead to a sharp decline after any suchbuying ends

4099170 die discovery edition eliminiert dieses risiko indem es entwicklern analysem glichkeiten und damit das wissen zur verf gung stellt das bei modernisierungsprojekten erforderlich ist
4099171 if we were to more strongly pool the strengths in germany of the existing know how in battery management and energy management in the medium term we could definitely also take a leading position in the field of rechargeable batteries similar to that in todays solar technology the required technical knowledge for this is already available
4099172 in the past eight years incredible progress has been made in cells and rechargeable battery technology as well as in the field of power electronics in the meantime lithium ion rechargeable batteries have achieved an energy density and a power density that not too long ago was considered unthinkable and also nowadays the energy management can be controlled much more accurately therefore we are confident that our project will lead to tangible commercially usable results
4099173 we anticipate that more powerful energy storage in combination with an efficient energy management system will significantly widen the range of applications for lift trucks in the industry

4099250 the wind rushes out of the valleys and as it hits the ridge the higher the ridge the more speed it gains as it goes up
4099251 by reducing the ridge altitude by hundreds of feet you change the wind patterns and therefore impact the wind speed
4099252 taking the wind map in gis software i placed the turbines along every part of the ridge at class 4 or higher wind speeds
4099253 using a spacing of three rotor diameters between turbines i found that 220 turbines could fit along the ridges
4099254 a lot of developers are wary of west virginia because most of the places where they propose wind arent in the coal fields theyre in the non coal producing counties where theres a lot of people with summer or winter homes or ski resorts and theres a lot of opposition
4099255 they know what the alternative is here and they know the community members would prefer a wind farm

4099310 e mail is not secure just as random pedestrians could easily reach into your mailbox and intercept the envelopes that you send and receive through the post office a curious hacker a malicious criminal or the fbi can easily intercept your e mail in some companies the e mail administrator has the ability to read any and all e mail messages and may fire you if you write anything inappropriate
4099311 be aware that when you send an email in rich text or html format the sender might only be able to receive plain text emails if this is the case the recipient will receive your message as a txt attachment most email clients however including microsoft outlook are able to receive html and rich text messages

4099314 auto complete this is another keyboard shortcut but its not commonly known and very useful go to the address bar control l and type the name of the site without the www or the com lets say google then press control enter and it will automatically fill in the www and the com and take you there like magic for net addresses press shift enter and for org addresses press control shift enter

4099320 consider masking your e mail address masking involves putting a word or phrase in your e mail address so that it will trick a harvesting computer program but not a person for example if your e mail address is johndoe myisp com you could mask it as johndoe spamaway myisp com be aware that some newsgroup services or message boards wont allow you to mask your email address and some harvesting programs may be able to pick out common masks
4099321 word definitions if you need to quickly look up the definition of a word or phrase simply use the

4099344 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4099345 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4099346 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4099347 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4099348 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4099349 they feel like if they can put more people on the street they can gain a lot of market share

4099352 we do not think mccormick is overvalued we just no longer believe it is undervalued
4099353 given that total u s internet users increased 5 percent year over year in the month it is clear that amazon continues to take market share and we believe amazons momentum of increasing transactions and third party sellers continues
4099354 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4099355 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4099356 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4099357 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4099358 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4099359 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4099360 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4099361 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4099362 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4099363 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4099364 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4099365 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4099366 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4099367 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4099368 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4099369 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4099370 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4099371 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4099372 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4099373 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4099374 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4099375 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4099376 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4099377 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4099378 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4099379 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4099380 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

4099384 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4099385 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

4099388 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4099389 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4099390 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4099391 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4099392 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4099393 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4099394 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4099395 i said from the very beginning that if any such facts prove true we will react in the most serious way the peaceful population should be protected we are investigating all these reports and will not allow any such actions
4099396 for another two days russian troops will stay in the region to carry out procedures of handing over control functions to georgian law enforcement bodies after which they will leave
4099397 georgia is a democratic government in the caucasus that has elected leaders to call it a project of anyplace of anybody perhaps belies more about what russia thinks about its neighbours that what it thinks about us policy
4099398 disperse anyone standing in a large group drawing attention to themselves
4099399 thirteen of us braved a downpour to sing give readings and contemplate hiroshima as we do every year
4099400 we were hassled by staff for being in an area allocated to fringe activity we explained our understanding that it is a public gathering place we were careful not to form an obstruction
4099401 they said that it was for performers only we pointed out that there was not a performer in sight because the area was awash with rainwater
4099402 its totally over the top the mound is a traditional public place for speeches and protests
4099403 i will be asking serious questions of the snp lib dem administration about this unacceptable attitude as it is they who in the end have responsibility for this
4099404 weve basically been told to disperse anyone standing in a large group drawing attention to themselves
4099405 if anyone wants to organise an event on the mound or the high street during the fringe all they have to do is contact the fringe office in advance
4099406 the fringe holds a temporary public entertainment licence so that everyone can enjoy the fantastic fringe atmosphere in a safe and organised manner our stewards manage the performances spaces and timetable all the outdoor action over the festival so everyone who wants to take part gets the opportunity to do so
4099407 this is an unfortunate situation but the cnd did not give notification of their event to the fringe or to the council and as a result were asked to move a few feet
4099408 if however the cnd would like to gather at any time in the future we will be able to accommodate them and inform them of any diary clashes that might occur
4099409 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4099410 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4099411 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4099412 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4099413 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4099414 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4099415 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4099416 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4099417 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4099418 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4099419 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4099420 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4099421 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4099422 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

4099461 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4099462 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4099463 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

4099467 im extremely proud of our employees who have worked so hard to ensure compliance and make this a reality
4099468 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4099469 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4099492 the global war on terror and the conflict in georgia
4099493 for anyone who thought that stark international aggression was a thing of the past the last week must have come as a startling wake up call after all georgia is a small remote and obscure place
4099494 a cease fire that holds is a vital first step but only one
4099495 u s credibility is on the line as the bush administration stumbles to respond to the russian invasion of georgia so far the administration has been missing in action
4099496 set the record straight on reports of the press adjustments more often applied to the reporting of say
4099497 president bush and his administration have taken aggressive action both public and non public to manage this crisis the white house reported last night
4099498 several times with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov and issued a statement calling for an immediate ceasefire
4099499 pre positioned disaster packages valued at 1 2 million to help those in need the packages include basic medical supplies tents blankets bedding hygiene items clothing beds and cots
4099500 this situation can be resolved peacefully weve been in contact with leaders in both georgia and russia at all levels of government georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of august the 6th
4099501 a disaster due to the effects of armed conflict in georgia and usaid provided an initial 250 000 for the local procurement and distribution of emergency relief supplies
4099502 i said this violence is unacceptable i not only said it to vladimir putin ive said it to the president of the country dmitriy medvedev and my administration has been engaged with both sides in this trying to get a cease fire and saying that the status quo ante for all troops should be august 6th and look i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
4099503 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russians relations russias relations with the united states and europe it is time for russia to be true to its word and to act to end this crisis
4099504 i want to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and its people we are reviewing our options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop we will continue to work diplomatically on this matter and will continue our discussions with all the parties involved
4099505 we expect russia to honor its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4099506 which will provide clean water for 20 000 people and medicine for about 400 wounded
4099507 as russian tanks and troops moved through the roki tunnel and across the internationally recognized border into georgia the russian government stated that it was acting only to protect ossetians
4099508 russian claims of humanitarian motives were further belied by a bombing campaign that encompassed the whole of georgia destroying military bases apartment buildings and other infrastructure and leaving innocent civilians wounded and killed
4099509 despite a french brokered cease fire which worryingly does not refer to georgias territorial integrity russian attacks have continued there are credible reports of civilian killings and even ethnic cleansing as russian troops move deeper into georgian territory
4099510 moscows foreign minister revealed at least part of his governments aim when he stated that
4099511 can no longer be our partner it would be better if he went
4099512 in the wake of this crisis there are the stirrings of a new trans atlantic consensus about the way we should approach russia and its neighbors
4099513 the world has learned at great cost the price of allowing aggression against free nations to go unchecked
4099514 we should work toward the establishment of an independent international peacekeeping force in the separatist regions and stand ready to help our georgian partners put their country back together
4099515 at the same time we must make clear to russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world

4099573 when we put a dent in the oil smuggling and insurgency operations we thereby lay a dent in al qaida of iraq

4099641 during the last olympics i was acutely aware that i had accomplished comparatively zilch in my life and yet was older than nearly all the athletes so the games made for kind of sucky viewing thankfully ive gotten past that stage and now just lust after the young male athletes especially the swimmers

4099739 permasalahan kesehatan di jabar yang disoroti pada perbincangan saya dengan dubes as di antaranya masalah harapan hidup masyarakat angka kematian bayi pelayanan kesehatan puskesmas dan angka kematian ibu melahirkan di jabar
4099740 beasiswa kepada para bidan ini agar bidan yang berasal dari kabupaten kota tertentu di jabar bisa kembali ke tempat asalnya dengan harapan bisa membantu menyelesaikan masalah kesehatan yang ada di tempat asalnya jadi nanti juga kita akan buat konsep agar perekrutan bidan itu benar benar berasal dari desa agar setelah menjadi bidan yang handal ia bisa praktek di desanya
4099741 berdasarkan data kesehatan tahun 2005 2007 sekitar 38 77 persen penolong kelahiran bayi di jabar adalah penolong non medis sehingga berisiko tinggi pada kematian bayi dan ibu melahirkan
4099742 tapi yang terpenting saat ini kesepahaman awalnya sudah ada kita tinggal mengajukan proposal bantuannya dan dubes as sudah menyanggupi untuk menindaklanjutinya

4099757 dengan tarif politis ini tidak memungkinkan pengusaha angkutan membeli bus pengganti pengusaha tidak bisa meremajakan bus
4099758 usia pakai bus kota seharusnya lebih muda dari taksi jika usia operasional taksi tujuh tahun dan harus segera diremajakan peremajaan bus kota harus dilakukan pada usia lima atau enam tahun
4099759 tetapi bagaimana pengusaha angkutan bus kota mau meremajakan bus jika kenaikan tarif selalu memberlakukan tarif politis
4099760 saya masuk pdip sejak tahun 2003 saat ini saya merasa resah dengan kondisi bangsa sekarang dan ingin berbuat bagi rakyat dengan mengedepankan kompetensi bukan hanya sekadar mengandalkan kepopuleran

4099768 the three parks being opened is based on the constitution of china that people are allowed to demonstrate if they have some issues
4099769 i think thats one step further for china to open up and i think its very good gesture
4099770 in china nobody will be persecuted or placed under house arrest because of their speech only those who break laws will be punished in accordance with the law
4099771 chinese citizens in accordance with the law enjoy the freedom of speech and other kinds of rights and freedoms
4099772 its clear to us that the protest zones are just a cynical public relations ploy on the part of the chinese authorities
4099773 we can see that the petitioners who made this attempt to speak have now suffered the consequences
4099774 sadly i think the protest zones are just a trap at some level
4099775 i have money in my checking account so i might as well spend it
4099776 if i get extra cash id better save it in case of an emergency

4099788 my father was a colleague of known muslim league leaders like fazlul haq and husyn shaheed suhrawardy when they visited rajshahi they used to stay at our residence so i grew up in a dense political environment
4099789 my father could never have agreed to send me there
4099790 there was freedom and a lot of work to do transport was cheap there was a tram service and there were friendly people all around i cannot recall a single calcutta street lane or by lane where i did not leave my footprints
4099791 calcutta and assam which we had always considered a part of the eastern wing of our new country pakistan went to india
4099792 there was a feeling that we had been robbed of a part of our victory but not the entire victory we had achieved something too
4099793 but the secession of bangladesh in 1971 was a full blown shock in which we lost everything
4099794 i spent three years at the parliament trying to tell the rulers they should not spend all the east pakistani money for development in west pakistan i tried to warn them that there was already smoke in east pakistan and there would soon be fire
4099795 the first thing i noticed here was that men looked at women with lust something i had never experienced in bengal and then there was bonded labour due to the domination of feudal lords
4099796 first off dont hire pr help until the volume of inbound requests by press are simply too much to handle without help
4099797 until then take the time to start reading blogs and other publications that cover what youre doing
4099798 and best of all you arent sucked into the web of politics and intrigue that guides the relationships between pr firms and the press you can build your own relationships and bypass all the mess
4099799 do not disturb takes place in new york city at a swanky hotel i will be playing a guest checking into the hotel and i am going to film my scenes sometime next week i think jerry oconnell is hysterical have you guys seen his video on that web site funnyordie and i cant wait to meet niecy

4099801 ive met with some of the coaches during the spring and really
4099802 we have improved customer traffic and ticket and overall sales growth in our markets
4099803 while inflation and higher fuel costs are pressuring suppliers retailers and customers worldwide were confident that wal mart is well positioned for this economy
4099804 that would also create ground for us to return to the negotiating table
4099805 no i dont but i do know the phillies did lose again to the dodgers in the 9th i didnt catch the final score sorry
4099806 in conjunction with the other selectors we decided to start a rebuilding process this year that involved the introduction of 10 players to senior inter county football and it proved a very difficult year for us
4099807 being an inter county manager is a full time job
4099808 while i felt i had the support of the players to continue with the rebuilding process for it to succeed i needed the support of everyone in the county from the top down and i felt i didnt have that support to continue on that basis i felt it best to step aside
4099809 there are unrealistic expectations in senior inter county management and that is there for all to see i suppose that is a reflection of the society we now live in success is demanded instant ly while patience and loyalty are in very short supply
4099810 so far this year eight managers have gone and there are still a couple of months left in the season i was very sad to see colm coyle and john maughan vacating their positions in very acrimonious circumstances
4099811 and when you see people like paddy crozier john omahony and micky harte who have had unbelievable success at national level having their ability being questioned it begs the question is it worth it
4099812 for me there is a far more serious danger coming down the tracks for the gaa and the laois county board the lure of australian football is causing major problems for all counties but laois seems to be the hardest hit
4099813 conor meredith has been offered a contract zach tuohy is going out to australia next week and donie kingston and others like him are also being courted by the australian clubs
4099814 when that kind of talent is being siphoned off a county it makes it next to impossible for that county to achieve success its very disheartening for those people who are bringing players through from under 12 right up to senior
4099815 actually i think we should have stopped two kids ago
4099816 because honey sometimes it feels like you are three or four kids
4099817 were going to share some ideas on how to move the process forward
4099818 all you have to do is a single definition of what your data looks like in a very simple way and then we can expose that to the rest of the world through multiple formats

4099844 in spite of remarkable progress over the past several decades our understanding of the complex physical chemical and biological earth system and its interactions with humans remains on many levels rudimentary
4099845 in order to monitor understand predict and adapt to climate change including the all important changes in extreme and impactful weather on local and regional scales where it really counts we have a long way to go now more than ever we need better earth observations increased computer power to process the observations and run the models improved weather and climate predictions and enhanced research on how weather and climate affect social order and life on the planet
4099846 calls for more funding are a familiar aspect of science what many observers may not realize is that in recent years the nations investments in the key areas listed above have been decreasing in real dollars
4099847 there is also no substitute for computing power to understand and predict weather and climate larger and faster computers allow scientists to effectively combine the suite of diverse global observations into a meaningful whole and to make predictions and warnings with increasing accuracy and detail for local areas ever more powerful computers will be needed to build and run earth system models that contain biological and chemical processes and human interactions these advanced models will be essential tools in both understanding and predicting climate change and in societal demands for information yet computing power at major climate modeling centers such as ncar is increasing in a business as usual way that does not reflect the importance of the science and the need for vastly improved decision support tools related to climate and weather
4099848 beyond the intellectual challenges they pose climate and weather changes stand to affect almost every part of our society public health and safety economic and social stability agriculture water supplies and management energy production and use transportation and military readiness in each of these areas policy and decision makers are clamoring for concrete guidance on what to expect as our climate and weather evolve and how to adapt to changes for example what kinds of crops are best suited to hotter more drought prone areas how might rising sea level intensified rainfall and changes in hurricanes affect cities along the gulf and atlantic coasts how long will it take for the arctic ocean to experience ice free conditions in summer how will energy and water demands and supplies change in my city state or region
4099849 in addressing these and other key questions scientists must provide quantitative as well as qualitative information at increasingly regional and local scales we need to work with users to understand what might happen what will almost certainly happen and where the science has yet to support firm conclusions with increased computing and modeling power we can expand the type of ensemble climate modeling systems that are beginning to tackle questions on the regional level such as what scenarios are possible most likely what are the worst and best cases what are the probabilities of the different scenarios how can we quantify the risks associated with various contemplated courses of action
4099850 our current ideas on how to deal with climate change rest on a scientific foundation that remains only partially built especially when it comes to large scale mitigation efforts we may know just enough to be dangerous people will inevitably make choices based on todays far from complete scientific knowledge society cannot stand still while we do our work but we must learn more
4099851 enhanced observations of earth are needed to validate and improve climate models support more accurate and precise predictions confirm or deny these predictions and detect surprises physical as well as social scientists must listen to stakeholders map out our vulnerabilities to extreme weather and learn how to increase societys flexibility and resilience in the face of a climate never before experienced by humans and we must develop the advanced models that can greatly improve our forecasting and warning systems and sharpen our look into the future
4099852 will we as a community be able to meet these national needs as a result of budget battles between the white house and congress federal funding for climate weather and other earth science research at nasa noaa and nsf will drop in real terms this year for the fourth year in a row while our ability to monitor earths vital signs begins to decline
4099853 future leaders in the white house and congress will be forced to juggle many priorities if climate change ranks among the top threats facing our planet as i and many others believe then it seems imperative that we invest in observing understanding and predicting our climate at a level commensurate with the risk we face while at the same time carrying out unprecedented mitigation and adaptation efforts on a local national and global basis
4099854 climate and weather changes stand to affect almost every part of our society public health and safety economic and social stability agriculture water supplies and management energy production and use transportation and military readiness
4099855 larger and faster computers allow scientists to effectively combine the suite of diverse global observations into a meaningful whole and to make predictions and warnings with increasing accuracy and detail for local areas
4099856 physical as well as social scientists must listen to stakeholders map out our vulnerabilities to extreme weather

4099858 the useful and yes hip israeli environmental blog in english
4099859 greening should be a project we can all engage in for this to be the case we need legislation that will place the proper incentives on environmentally sound decisions help people pay for the high up front costs of energy efficiency and make polluters pay for environmentally damaging activities and for that we need an abundance of genuine environmental advocates sitting in the knesset whose concerns are for the long term well being of the land and people of israel
4099860 the grist and treehugger books reflect the ethos of an environmental movement that has undergone profound changes since its inception in the 1970s
4099861 so this book is best read by the already environmentally converted who want to cut straight to what they should be doing it features a consumption centerfold advice on what to do with animal poop israelis should first remove it from the sidewalk and then consider the other options and an answer to whether a slice of lime in your beer bottle threatens its recyclability it doesnt overall grists focus gives the impression that to paraphrase the grateful dead we may be going to hell in a bucket but at least we can enjoy the ride

4099922 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
4099923 after the events of the past six days no one should wonder why countries on russias periphery so ardently seek the security guarantees alliance membership represents
4099924 the situation is still unstable and russia must back up its commitment to stop its violence and violation of georgias sovereignty with actions not just words
4099925 the united states should now join our european partners in direct high level diplomacy with both georgia and russia to seek immediate implementation of a cease fire and to achieve a lasting resolution to this crisis
4099926 for all sides to show restraint and to stop this armed conflict
4099927 i know the people of georgia have enjoyed an unprecedented period of prosperity and freedom and i know that at this time theyre suffering mightily

4099989 we used to think air pollution was a problem that primarily affects the lungs we now know it is also bad for the heart
4099990 there doesnt have to be an environmental catastrophe for air pollution to cause injury
4099991 were talking about very modest increases air pollution can be dangerous at levels that are within the accepted air quality standards
4099992 patients with cardiovascular disease shouldnt exercise outside on days with increased air pollution levels on very polluted days they should consider staying inside and during the winter they should limit exposure to fireplace smoke
4099993 of course the real solution is to reduce air pollution
4099994 the review by dr simkhovich and his fellow authors make it quite clear that air pollution is linked to cardiovascular disease
4099995 they suggest that this is another compelling reason to campaign for improved air quality while at the same time studying therapies to minimize the risk of exposures
