820045 we attribute much to chance meetings refer to them as turning points in our life but these encounters could never have occurred had we not made ourselves ready for them if we possessed more awareness these fortuitous encounters would yield still greater rewards it is only at certain unpredictable times that we are fully attuned fully expectant and thus in a position to receive the favors of fortune the man who is fully awake knows that every happening is packed with significance
820046 the relief she felt at finding rolfs book a few years ago and thinking there really are people who think like me cannot be described
820047 the car was picked up by the water and washed under the fence
820048 there was a hollow under the fence his car was sucked through that and 200 300 metres out into paddocks by the time we got there some bystanders had got him out of the car and he was sitting on a grassy nob just beyond it
820049 three quarters of his car was under water if they hadnt got him out he mightnt have made it
820050 we went in there with a scoop stretcher and a couple of guys and brought him back through the water to the road
820051 he was swept into the paddock and stayed in the car until some locals and the fire service got him out they were standing in water that was at least waist deep

820067 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function
820068 he has a compulsive tendency to see both sides of an issue and yet this style is surely the antidote to the politics of the past several years it is surely true that a president who brings a deliberative style to the white house will multiply his knowledge not divide it
820069 people are saying that senator obamas recent changes of position have made him a flip flopper hes not flip floppers only hold one position at a time senator obama is different he holds two positions at the same time

820080 project out and to then try to plant a flag on a particular date
820081 we know how we think we need to try to get there with our iraqi partners and increasingly with them in the lead and shouldering more of the burden as they are
820082 but there are a lot of storm clouds out there there are lots of these possible lightning bolts you just dont know what it could be you try to anticipate them and you try to react very quickly its all there but its not something you want to lay out publicly
820083 on july 3 news reports said senator john mccain worried that he might lose the election before it truly started opened his doors to disciples of karl rove from the 2004 campaign and the bush white house less than a month later the results are on full display the candidate who started out talking about high minded civil debate has wholeheartedly adopted mr roves low minded and uncivil playbook
820084 used to pride himself on being above this ugly brand of politics which killed his own 2000 presidential bid but he clearly tossed his inhibitions aside earlier this month when he put day to day management of his campaign in the hands of one acolyte of mr rove and gave top positions to two others the r sum s of the new teams members included stints in mr bushs white house and in his 2004 re election campaign one of the most negative and divisive in memory
820085 suppose everybody stopped smoking and tobacco farmers grew food instead

820091 if theres a sink full of dirty dishes he knows im going to take care of that before i want to get intimate if he wasnt helping with the housework i would not find that very attractive
820092 when a man does housework it feels to the woman like an expression of caring and concern
820093 a guy can be completely stressed out and want to have sex to burn it off but women are not wired like that
820094 as mens housework goes up womens marital satisfaction also goes up but mens marital satisfaction goes down

820096 i think the world is keenly interested in this election and i think theyre hungry for a sense of where america is going

820101 i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
820102 and when one man is enslaved all are not free
820103 we in the west stand ready to cooperate with the east to promote true openness to break down barriers that separate people to create a safe freer world
820104 in europe the view that america is part of what has gone wrong in our world rather than a force to help make it right has become all too common in america there are voices that deride and deny the importance of europes role in our security and our future
820105 both views miss the truth that europeans today are bearing new burdens and taking more responsibility in critical parts of the world and that just as american bases built in the last century still help to defend the security of this continent so does our country still sacrifice greatly for freedom around the globe
820106 partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice it is the one way the only way to protect our common security and advance our common humanity
820107 that is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another
820108 if i could get it down to 2 percent or 1 percent i would go there
820109 if you could get it right we might stay in the business

820114 even mr obamas advisers say they are uneasy about his difficulty so far in breaking the 50 percent barrier a reminder in poll after poll that there are many americans who are not yet ready to cast their lot with him and may never be
820115 it took a long while for the american public to test and look at ronald reagan before they were willing to go with him

820119 im running for president of the united states because i want to help with family values and i think that family values are important when we have two parent families that are of parents that are the traditional family
820120 what i want to see is that you are fully engaged with an issue and that youve broken some sweat trying to figure out the problem in all it wonderful complexity
820121 more specifically ill be looking for a focused tightly crafted argument and analytic rigor in working through the legal or policy problems raised by your argument a thorough examination of the diversity of opinion that exists on the issue or theme a willingness after having looked at the various facets of the topic to take a stand and offer concrete proposals or approaches to the problem
820122 hey im supposed to be filled with the holy spirit and a fruit of the spirit is joy god actually commands us to rejoice great im definitely not the picture of joy today not only am i paralyzed by melancholy but im disobeying too
820123 yeh i used to have a hard time with that but now praise god i dont
820124 should someone ask me whether i would indicate the west such as it is today as a model to my country frankly i would have to answer negatively through intense suffering our country has now achieved a spiritual development of such intensity that the western system in its present state of spiritual exhaustion does not look attractive
820125 solzhenitsyn anticipated that communism would disintegrate that the criminal element nurtured in the gulag would take control of russias economy that members of the kgb and the criminal elements were actually the same people and that it would take 100 years for russia to recover from communism
820126 soviet experts in the west scoffed at these prognostications whos laughing now
820127 als student heb ik twee jaar lang elke week bij wijze van corvee al deze trappen schoongemaakt om mijn studie en verblijfskosten te drukken dat was me een werk
820128 ik zal het verdriet in hun ogen nooit vergeten toen ik vertelde dat ik wegging het eerste jaar konden ze het niet opbrengen mij te schrijven pas na een jaar kwam hun eerste brief gelukkig hebben ze zich er uiteindelijk mee verzoend dat dit gods weg met mij was
820129 ik weet nog goed dat ik me echt in een soort heiligdom waande toen ik de eerste keer deze bijbelschool binnenwandelde in suriname waren er helemaal geen bijbelscholen later zou hij er zelf een stichten red dus dit was voor mij heel bijzonder
820130 vroeger keek ik tegen een blinde muur aan het is nu veel lichter maar het ruikt nog steeds muf
820131 als ik s avonds te laat binnen was op dat punt was men best streng
820132 afgezien van de warme maaltijden hadden wij ltijd jam en bruine suiker we kregen n keer per week een plakje kaas per student geen fruit geen melk en n keer per maand een potje pindakaas dat was altijd feest
820133 het is hier nog precies zoals toen in deze zaal de kapel waren ook geregeld diensten en bezinningsmomenten en in het tweede jaar heb ik hier oefenpreken gehouden
820134 het waren echte godsmannen ik had misschien mede vanuit mijn surinaamse achtergrond een groot ontzag voor leiders nu ik er zelf n ben merk ik dat ik nog steeds respect heb voor leidinggevenden in de kerk ik denk dat ik daardoor ook anders omga met leiderschap naar anderen toe ik ben absoluut geen autoritair leider integendeel dat heeft waarschijnlijk te maken met het feit dat zij zo enorm veel in mij hebben ge nvesteerd investeren in nieuwe leiders zie ik nu op mijn beurt als mijn belangrijkste taak in drachten
820135 het eerste halfjaar moest ik op de bijbelschool blijven nelleke zou in amsterdam worden gedoopt maar ik mocht niet weg het kwam niet eens in mij op om toch toestemming te vragen regels zijn regels dus pech ik maakte geen verwijt het was nu eenmaal zo
820136 het waren soms complete theologische verhandelingen bijvoorbeeld over het verbond of over de uitverkiezing waar we allebei in suriname nog nooit van hadden gehoord
820137 ik heb wel eens postzegels naar orlando opgestuurd zodat hij brieven aan mij kon frankeren want geld was een voortdurend probleem hij had geen studiebeurs zoals ik
820138 er waren maanden bij dat de penningmeester van de school me bij zich riep nog een week te gaan en je hebt nog niet betaald god zal voorzien antwoordde ik ik sprak het uit maar geloofde het eigenlijk zelf niet toch gebeurde het echt maand na maand dat was een les in vertrouwen die ik nooit ben vergeten vandaar dat ik ook een envelop met geld heb meegenomen in de knapzak van het overgrote deel van alle giften die ik twee jaar lang heb ontvangen ook vanuit nederland trouwens weet ik niet van wie het geld afkomstig was ik leefde van de raven zeg ik wel eens net zoals elia bij de beek krith en het grappige is dat deze giftenstroom meteen stopte toen ik mijn diploma in ontvangst had genomen en we gingen trouwen
820139 onze directeur george winston had na afloop van zijn prediking tegen ons studenten gezegd ga naar je kamertje pak pen en schrijfpapier neem de tijd en laat de heilige geest je te binnen brengen wat er nog in jouw leven veranderen moet en schrijf dat op
820140 ik wist het meteen er was een bepaalde zonde in mijn leven waar ik zo vaak voor had gebeden heer neem hem weg maar tegelijk koesterde ik deze zonde die middag zei ik uit de grond van mijn hart alstublieft met wortel en al wil ik deze boezemzonde uitroeien uit mijn leven op dat moment gebeurde er iets wat ik nauwelijks kan omschrijven de kamer werd zo ongelofelijk vol van de aanwezigheid van de heilige geest ik hoorde een soort wind waaien dat ik begon te zingen maar ik hield het er niet lang uit en kon gewoon niet langer in mijn kamertje blijven ik r nde naar buiten alle trappen af de straat op en liep naar een heel uitgebreid kantorencomplex verderop springend en zingend
820141 ik was blij dat het zes uur was anders hadden de mensen me allemaal voor gek verklaard als ze me daar zo zagen dit was mijn eerste ervaring met vol zijn van de heilige geest vanaf die dag heb ik geleerd dat ik god echt onvoorwaardelijk wilde dienen en dat alle aspecten van mijn leven onder de heerschappij van christus moesten komen te staan
820142 deze aanraking door gods geest gaf mij een diepe innerlijke heling veel christenen zijn op zoek naar spectaculaire dingen dat zie je ook nu rond lakeland de omstreden opwekking in florida red en bij een beweging als trin in nederland ik heb daar mijn reserves bij we moeten oppassen dat accenten niet verkeerd worden gelegd karakterverandering is het grootste wonder
820143 de gemeenschap heeft hier voor mij zon diepe betekenis gekregen wat het betekent om samen als studenten en docenten christen te zijn het was natuurlijk geen gemeente maar de beleving van hoe je dingen met elkaar deelt is voor mij heel rijk geweest
820144 destijds begonnen de vrijzinnige denkbeelden van invloedrijke theologen als wiersinga en kuitert volop te spelen in deze opleiding waren de liefde voor gods woord en de bijbelgetrouwheid zo groot dat dit mijn hele leven gestempeld heeft
820145 ik kan met volle overtuiging zeggen dat ik nu honderd procent sta in de roeping die god voor mij heeft ik ben een gemeenteman geworden in hart en nieren
820146 wij denken het wel ja nelleke en ik hebben een aantal jaren geleden overwogen of we ons niet moesten richten op een nieuwe taak maar de uitdaging in drachten was en is zo enorm groot dat we toch hebben besloten te blijven omdat we hier door de omvang van deze gemeente het meest vruchtbaar kunnen zijn in gods koninkrijk de enige plek die s ms een rol speelt in mijn denken is de randstad die uitdaging zou ik enorm vinden
820147 if the choice is between a republican and a republican they will take the real republican every time
820148 first every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry
820149 the capital which an amsterdam merchant employs in carrying corn from konigsberg to lisbon and fruit and wine from lisbon to konigsberg must generally be the one half of it at konigsberg and the other half at lisbon no part of it need ever come to amsterdam the natural residence of such a merchant should either be at konigsberg or lisbon and it can only be some very particular circumstances which can make him prefer the residence of amsterdam
820150 by preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry he intends only his own security and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value he intends only his own gain and he is in this as in many other cases led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention
820151 im running for president of the united states because i want to help with family values and i think that family values are important when we have two parent families that are of parents that are the traditional family

820156 het programma onthult informatie die de kijker versteld doet staan in de eerste aflevering testen we bijvoorbeeld openbare toiletten in nederland op hygi ne het resultaat blijkt schrikbarend verder zien we in iedere aflevering hoe iemand zich laat testen op zijn gezondheid dat kan een gewone nederlander zijn maar ook een bner
820157 ik heb al hele interessante dingen ontdekt die voor de kijker heel interessant zijn we gaan er bijvoorbeeld vanuit dat kinderen geen contactlenzen mogen dragen maar dat blijkt helemaal niet waar te zijn verder volgen we in het programma alle nieuwe ontwikkelingen op de voet zitten er nu meer calorie n in een broodje kroket of een broodje kaas

820162 and i would have some other choice words if there werent so many cameras in here
820163 i was getting out of the car and was tossed a piece of paper that i picked up stuck it in with a whole bunch of things that i had been reading on my way in from the airport and handed it to media relations official bud ford to put in his briefcase and forgot about it
820164 about being in birmingham i wasnt trying to mislead anybody i hadnt looked at anything

820169 you cant say it has to be a certain number of wins

820171 in three or four years that will change youll have to say recruiting is part of it are the players here are they functioning well at this point all you can hope for is that the players play hard that they know what theyre doing and that there seems to be a good chemistry between them and the coaches those are the things that im hoping will come to pass
820172 exactly what the problem was i dont know whether it was talent approach to the game leadership within the team coaching leadership

820177 and there is little evidence to contradict their claims george w bush has already won the 2004 election
820178 after six years of technological research more than 4 billion spent by washington on new machinery and a widespread overhaul of the nations voting system this months midterm election revealed that the country is still far from able to ensure that every vote counts
820179 i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
820180 the problem with policies that favor the economic elite is that by themselves theyre not a winning electoral strategy because there arent enough elite voters
820181 are not really serious about making sure that voter id is free for those who cant afford it
820182 one of the things we can do to limit fraud is to limit the benefits to be gained by fraud under a direct popular vote system one fraudulent vote wins one vote in the return in the electoral college system one fraudulent vote could mean 45 electoral votes 28 electoral votes

820230 he can bring the attributes of the young stoner guy he needs for pineapple but underneath that is the scholar and the deep thinker and the guy who wants to learn about art and is interested in politics his performances are complex and layered

820232 we sent him pineapple for the role of dale the idea came up to switch roles

820257 que destacan y reivindican siempre en todas y cada una de las acciones nacionales proletarias los intereses comunes y peculiares de todo el proletariado independientes de su nacionalidad y en que cualquiera que sea la etapa hist rica en que se mueva la lucha entre el proletariado y la burgues a mantienen siempre el inter s del movimiento enfocado en su conjunto los comunistas son pues pr cticamente la parte m s decidida el acicate siempre en tensi n de todos los partidos obreros del mundo te ricamente llevan de ventaja a las grandes masas del proletariado su clara visi n de las condiciones los derroteros y los resultados generales a que ha de abocar el movimiento proletario
820258 hasta hoy toda sociedad descans como hemos visto en el antagonismo entre las clases oprimidas y las opresoras mas para poder oprimir a una clase es menester asegurarle por lo menos las condiciones indispensables de vida pues de otro modo se extinguir a y con ella su esclavizamiento la situaci n del obrero moderno es muy distinta pues lejos de mejorar conforme progresa la industria decae y empeora por debajo del nivel de su propia clase el obrero se depaupera y el pauperismo se desarrolla en proporciones mucho mayores que la poblaci n y la riqueza he ah una prueba palmaria de la incapacidad de la burgues a para seguir gobernando la sociedad e imponiendo a sta por norma las condiciones de su vida como clase es incapaz de gobernar porque es incapaz de garantizar a sus esclavos la existencia ni aun dentro de su esclavitud porque se ve forzada a dejarlos llegar hasta una situaci n de desamparo en que no tiene m s remedio que mantenerles cuando son ellos quienes debieran mantenerla a ella la sociedad no puede seguir viviendo bajo el imperio de esa clase la vida de la burgues a se ha hecho incompatible con la sociedad

820326 we as a group of representatives of independent entrepreneurs believe that the achievements of azerbaijan in the international arena and improvement of the welfare of the population are services of the current president ilham aliyev

820330 authorities should make evidence against mammadov public and azerbaijan should work to remedy not aggravate its record of jailing journalists on trumped up charges
820331 the means that are used to discredit one journalist to say that hes a homosexual are just shameful
820332 there is no justification to use that kind of method his credibility as a journalist is not affected by whether he is straight or a homosexual we know that the journalist has been threatened and blackmailed the real reason is not his purported homosexuality the real reason is because he is a threat to the authorities
820333 the police hit me on the back of my head and neck and then forced me into a car
820334 i really cant find the words to celebrate this result the best of our season we had a few difficulties in practice but during qualifying the drivers pushed themselves to the limit and things got better and better today timo did a fantastic race we saw immediately that his car was quick and and his third stint was almost perfect he was under threat from kimi but he was quick in the third sector and he was able to fend him off jarno was quick as well and pushed hard but he was blocked for most of the race he couldnt show his pace until briefly in the last stint so this is a stunning performance and my thanks go out to the whole team and everyone working in the factory im very appreciative of all their hard work and next we will aim for the centre of the podium
820335 what an incredible feeling i couldnt believe it when i saw felipes engine go and i was p2 to get such a good result in my first year is fantastic so a huge thank you to all the team including the engineers mechanics and everyone at the factory i knew from qualifying that we had good speed and weve looked strong all weekend today i made a good start and gained a place into the first corner i had a really good car and everything went perfectly until the last stint on the soft tyres i was struggling a lot and soon i had kimi behind me but i knew from last year here in gp2 when i was stuck in the midfield in a really good car how hard it is to pass here so when i saw him in the mirrors i knew i couldnt afford any mistakes this result more than makes up for hockenheim and now we must keep picking up regular points until the end of the season
820336 this is a very good result for us and to pick up ten points is great for the constructors championship im glad for timo because he has had a very good weekend and fully deserves this result this could have been better for me too despite my problems in qualifying i was quick today but i couldnt push because i only had one lap that was clear of traffic in the whole afternoon i gained one position early on but overtaking is practically impossible here around the second stops i was also stuck behind lewis holding me up further still im delighted that we are showing such strong form and i just hope we can carry on in good shape and with such good results
820337 what kind of racer are you do you stand around and analyze everything you did and beat yourself up because you could have done better

820359 since 2003 the number of california eighth graders taking algebra i has increased from 34 percent to 52 percent compared with just 30 percent of eighth graders nationwide
820360 the state board must choose whether we align the eighth grade mathematics test with our high expectations or perpetuate a two track system one for high achievers and one for those of whom we expect less
820361 this fork in the road is a choice between californias bold future and a status quo that is safe mediocre and unacceptable
820362 in 2007 californias eighth graders ranked 44th in the nation in mathematics achievement
820363 i am asking the state board to do away with the below grade level general mathematics test and designate the states existing algebra i exam as californias test to measure eighth grade mathematics for federal accountability purposes to do otherwise would lower our expectations and continue to divide our children between those we believe in and those we leave behind
820364 if we dont believe in every childs potential how can we ask children to believe in themselves

820375 about 350 years ago a shipload of travelers landed on the northeast coast of america the first year they established a town site the next year they elected a town government the third year the town government planned to build a road five miles westward into the wilderness in the fourth year the people tried to impeach their town government because they thought it was a waste of public funds to build a road five miles westward into a wilderness who needed to go there anyway here were people who had the vision to see three thousand miles across an ocean and overcome great hardships to get there but in just a few years they were not able to see even five miles out of town they had lost their pioneering vision with a clear vision of what we can become in christ no ocean of difficulty is too great without it we rarely move beyond our current boundaries

820508 the challenge hamdan v rumsfeld and the fight over presidential power
820509 the generic problem is the question of why people having useful knowledge cant be bribed to reveal it
820510 if you have to spend your life reading the talmud you are not very good at software
820511 the sacrifices get you social welfare but if you took a bribe your value outside of that club would be minuscule
820512 they thought of it as something they really enjoy and like to do but now they do it in order to get money and they think of the task as an instrument to get money and not an activity that has value in its own right
820513 human beings both want to and in a deeper way need to feel a sense of being autonomous when someone else begins to seduce you into behaving with an offer of a reward it takes away your sense of being autonomous now you are doing it for someone else
820514 a central tenet of economics is that individuals respond to incentives
820515 for psychologists and sociologists in contrast rewards and punishments are often counterproductive because they undermine intrinsic motivation
820516 if i pay my kids to do their homework i am saying you will get this if you do your homework but i am also saying homework is not likely to have intrinsic rewards
820517 you are such a smart kid you must be a whiz at math expert teachers said i can see you are really concentrating
820518 well mr vice president if it doesnt sing and dance we dont really have to worry much from a missionary point of view
820519 any discovery of extraterrestrial life would raise some challenging questions about the origin of life on earth as well as elsewhere about the centrality of humankind in the universe and about the creation story in the bible
820520 the group felt strongly that the general public needs to know more about this whole subject and what astrobiology is trying to do
820521 because the relationship of god and man is so central and the idea that man was made in gods image and put on earth is so strong
820522 a god that created the earth and life on other earths would still be majestic but the logic of him being someone to pray to and to get salvation from diminishes
820523 christians and others have debated this question for centuries and often more intently than today
820524 theyve argued over whether and how christ might go to other planets if life was there and then theres the whole question of how could life exist elsewhere if it isnt really mentioned in the bible
820525 its a problem for the club for sporting director pedja mijatovic and the coach we are players we only think about football
820526 but now wesley sneijder is injured and hes an important player for us maybe tomorrow there will be a meeting with the people in the club and maybe then theres going to be news about this
820527 we know cristiano ronaldo is an incredible player and we dont have any problem with him joining us
820528 if he came of course the players and the fans would be excited the supporters are used to watching the best players in the world at the bernabeu and cristiano ronaldo is one of the best players in the world
820529 i feel the best of real madrid is the squad and the dressing room and if cristiano is coming here we dont have room for him in the team but as i said before maybe with the injury to wesley sneijder maybe we need someone else
820530 since i have been here it has been stop start with a lot of injuries and it is probably the first time in my career it has been like that
820531 i had a few niggly problems early on with hamstrings but i have had big major things since i have been here it is six operations i think i have had and not one prior
820532 the end of the season was great when i get in a rhythm and start playing regularly i feel great
820533 i started scoring a few goals and that will continue as long as i get on the pitch and im fine
820534 we had a good time of it and there was a feel good factor about the club and we were buzzing as a group hopefully we can start the new season in the same way as we finished the last one
820535 we try to improve the squad every year we try to reduce the gap we try to be closer and we want to win every trophy
820536 we are improving the squad every year we are trying to be contenders in the premier league we are trying to progress in the champions league and in other competitions
820537 i was surprised when people were talking about us not having won anything in the last two years but to finish third or fourth in the premier league and to reach the final and the semi final in the champions league i think its good its important
820538 we want medals and trophies but were talking about united and chelsea playing in the final of the champions league and theyre at the top of the premier league so this is maybe the most difficult league but we will try to improve again
820539 this is a very physical superhero were talking about hes bound to get hungry
820540 its another pet peeve of mine how little the question of hunger or the need to eat is addressed in comics
820541 not now alfred first ive got to solve this case

820545 i thought that your blog was pretty interesting you did a good job
820546 it seemed like we needed a 12 step program to cure us of our addictions to buying beaten up stocks trading at large discounts to our assessment of their intrinsic value

820578 hi vale hows it going this is your circa 2000 intern rick wow that was nearly a decade ago ive been living in budapest for the last couple years being financially minimal and traveling around eastern europe whenever i get the chance so i was reading through your blog which is great but the way and got all excited when i came across your december 4 2007 entry where you mention goran bregovic if youre into that kind of music i wanted to recommend this incredible cd comp of balkan brass bands called golden brass summit http www cdroots com hm brass html which documents bands that play at this huge balkan brass festival in guca serbia i think it stretches back to the 1960s and maybe even earlier tens of thousands of people show up and theres dozens and dozens of bands playing all over the place i actually managed to get to guca twice and its insane i wrote an article about it at my blog with pictures if youre interested http thelittleblackegg blogspot com 2007 10 power and glory html i was gonna go this year too but the current political situation there has made me rethink that plan personally ive got mixed feelings about goran myself hes really talented but many of his songs are just arrangements of traditional tunes that he slaps writing credits on im not so high fiber that i cant still enjoy his stuff but some of my serbian acquaintances have had pretty horrible experiences with him claiming that hes stolen stuff theyve composed copyright law isnt priority number one in serbia right now that being said the underground soundtrack rules and if it hadnt been for that music i probably wouldnt be out here right now and when i saw him at guca in 2007 the crowd went nuts ok ive gone on too long just wanted to say hello i hope all is well rick

820672 that means having the ability to remove the virus from the body or to suppress it to the point where it can no long do any damage
820673 because the progress we are making against human immunodeficiency virus is much larger than in other comparable serious diseases at the moment we have medicines that are better than ever at treating patients and possibly even healing them
820674 when we look at the progress of the last four to six years and use it to extrapolate the future then we can imagine a cure

820679 japan in contrast to the united states has long suffered from a shortage of lawyers especially in the countryside if it was not unusual for towns with five times yakumos population to have no lawyer how could yakumo hope to secure one just for itself and yet thanks to a national campaign to raise the number of lawyers and to dispatch them to lawyerless corners of japan yakumo welcomed its first one in april the yakumo legal office opened shop behind gray blinds and under blue awnings in the square facing the train station
820680 half of japans lawyers are concentrated in tokyo leaving only one lawyer for every 30 000 japanese outside the capital according to the federation the japanese government is trying to increase the number of lawyers as part of broader judicial reforms that have included establishing 74 law schools since 2004 under the system that will be abolished in 2011 anyone could take the national bar exam though it was so difficult that the annual pass rate was about 3 percent

820704 its possible to give all these films a feminist reading in teeth and thelma and louise there is definite wish fulfilment for female audiences in seeing brutality addressed in direct and often inventive ways but in every case there is a bleakness that ultimately undermines any other message cumulatively they induce a sense of fear the sense that the footsteps behind you are growing louder and a recognition that while harassment proliferates justice does not this may be realistic but theres an inadvertent misogynist message one that encourages women to feel unsafe to stay at home

820709 it is with pride and pleasure that harriette and i pay tribute to the israel museum and enrich its holdings in photography with the gift of our collection on the occasion of the state of israels 60th anniversary
820710 one of my goals when i joined the tour was to win an event and i wasnt sure if it was going to happen since ill be stepping away after this season
820711 but the waves pumped this event this is what the dream tour should be like all the time im definitely stepping away from the asp tour at the end of this year but im not retiring im still planning on competing at pipeline and teahupoo and at venues that i can get into
820712 i was tripping out in the water when they kept announcing fred patacchia and i in the final you never hear that
820713 it was all business though this is only the second time ive ever made one on tour and i wasnt about to let it go i was trying my hardest out there
820714 my brother has won this event twice and all i could think about in the final is how i wanted that trophy
820715 the thing is sick it was a great event and were going to have a huge party tonight
820716 bruce irons and i are good friends but we were super competitive in that final
820717 both of us wanted to win and we were hassling and trash talking and everything i had one wave at the start but bruce got two bombs towards the end and i could tell he was really gunning for it
820718 it feels great to come back after a slow start to the year
820719 the waves were so good for this event and im bummed i didnt win but to have bruce irons there and since hes stepping away it feels good that we kept the title within hawaii
820720 if i had come out of that one barrel then i would have been in the final but ive had a great day and a 3rd place finish really helps me this year the next event is in my backyard lower trestles and im pretty confident out there ill be spending a lot of time preparing for that event but first i am going to enjoy this magical island and all the beautiful waves it has to offer
820721 this is the best result of my career and it takes the pressure off of me to get a 3rd at the halfway point this season
820722 i dont know what it will do to the ratings but it should help me and give me a better seed going into lower trestles i have a pretty busy summer i am doing all the asp wqs events in europe so it is a lot of surfing for me coming up

820743 without a doubt the most popular tickets are for tennis track and field and artistic gymnastics however team sports are also popular especially the quarter finals in basketball and volleyball many have asked about the availability of tickets for youth events unfortunately there are not many tickets to these matches interestingly there has been a strong demand for tickets to the olympic football tournament even though no russian team plays in either the mens or the womens division

820752 for we are gods workmanship created in christ jesus to do good works which god prepared in advance for us to do

820754 chris is blind and damn it he is certainly capable of sin
820755 you believe because you have seen blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe

820779 for instance the south korean team is very strong and performs reliably in the olympics even the brazilians who havent done much to date may give us a surprise
820780 our main rival is korea they are more disciplined in their game than other teams compared to us figuratively speaking they play with ease it is like each of them has a little motor inside of the teams in our subgroup the hungarians are no push overs we recently played brazil so we have to be careful with them their last match against the french team proved that they can compete against all comers so i cant say that we have any weak rivals
820781 the main thing for us is that we have faith in our abilities and a victorious attitude
820782 weve been in china before when we played in the youth championship so we are familiar with the specific conditions to be found there yes we were there in august and it was very hot and humid however there are going to be air conditioners in the arena so one can see that weather plays no role in our game everything will be good

820790 if senator barack obama ever needs a living symbol of change we can believe in and a hopeful way to transcend the dirty politics of our failed energy policies he should go and see the future of renewable energy in the coal river valley in west virginia
820791 beat out ashton kutcher and demi moore and fashion dont victoria and david beckham
820792 the idea that a mild mannered playboy actor like me would even know how to hit someone let alone have the courage to do it is absurd

820816 these really dangerous fats are in everyday foods that people eat and particularly in junk and processed foods

820824 he flagged he was thinking about the next phase of his professional life that he would do that with his family and im sure thats what hes doing
820825 its an important part of an opposition leaders role as the alternative prime minister to be in touch with global economic events

820852 the climate has made millions of americans who havent been involved in a political campaign ever in their lifetimes very active
820853 we estimate that 70 percent of our grass roots volunteers havent worked in a campaign before were somewhere just shy of 2 million volunteers and we think we can potentially triple that on election day
820854 we think the turnout will be beyond record turnout and if were effective we will have done two additional things brought in millions of new people who are registered to vote and we will increase the percentage of registered voters who will turn out
820855 this allows us to increase the volume of voters were talking to and have it be done with people who live in their community
820856 people tend to believe information delivered by people they know and who live in their neighborhood more than an ad they see on television or what some third party from out of their state is telling them
820857 hey got a virus download this program to scan for it we wont get rid of it well just re affirm that you do in fact have the virus
820858 the popularity and awareness of blogging in the us can partly be explained by cultural differences the american tradition of talk radio encourages people to speak their mind and blogs give an ideal platform for people who want to rant
820859 youd be hard pressed to find an american journalist who isnt reading blogs on a regular basis regardless of whether or not they keep one
820860 weve decided that were very comfortable in third place and if katie couric left the newscast we would see a ratings spike but were not prepared to do that
820861 we are extremely proud that the hard work of our publicity department convincing journalists around the country to write an unprecedented number of articles about a show that 99 of their readers have never seen
820862 its all part of our new strategy to blackmail the american people into watching mad men just so they wont feel like an idiot when reading their favorite newspapers and magazines
820863 we established a very successful pattern for our batman movies in the 90s of first producing two dark moody well respected films and then following them up with big budget debacles helmed by a hack director and starring good looking dull actors
820864 were very excited to have the opportunity to drive a new 21st century batman franchise into the ground in the same way
820865 at first when i asked if i could play a role in the dark knight warner bros told me no way
820866 but then my agents at hollywood extras casting said i fit the description for a tall white male they needed for a party that takes place in bruce waynes penthouse
820867 again you seek to free me to save me but not from religion no this time i am captive by the agents of light those who seek to imprison wonder replacing it with the biophysical because we know that what we know cannot be described only by the biophysical
820868 yes but we will not subscribe to your voodoo nor witchcraft either
820869 to free me you have to remind hume of spinoza present logic flows from the assumption that the mind and body are distinct entities that interact and while this is helpful to the biophysicist the model leaves no room for psychologist the experience of the mind
820870 but what if we view the world as one distinct entity if the island rapanui you and your mind are one and the same
820871 but perhaps you fail to see that we will never know the true world you will never find a end solution there
820872 but what you fail to see is that what you seek is happiness the reason you try to know the island perhaps that happiness is higher knowledge because it is a knowledge that we share independently of false ideas that arise from observation it is a knowledge within us
820873 and what if mind is simply the idea corresponding to the human body and more capable bodies are equivalent to more capable minds
820874 mind including imagination which includes memory and sense perception w e fool ourselves if we believe imagination and intellect to be the same while imagination is useful for us to travel about our world it is a distorted and incomplete picture of things in it
820875 yes through agents of light we learn that the external body interacts with sensory organ of ones own body and incurs changes
820876 but the changed state of ones body is a function of natures body and ones body the state contains the external and internal body
820877 unfortunately this means sense perception is grounded in the representation of the state of its own body the information about the external body is not pure
820878 a mode of extension and the idea of that mode are one and the same thing but expressed in two ways
820879 for this reason the imagination is confused and inadequate knowledge of the external body is further limited because we do not know all its causes and cannot contain all the causes of an object inds ideas of its body duration parts and even itself are all inadequate
820880 however we may know common things adequately things common to all bodies or certain bodies by which the human body is regularly affected some thing a which is present in the human body and another body affecting the human body this ensures the minds perception of a is neither confused nor mutilated and is adequate such ideas can serve as axioms in deductive systems reason and geometry
820881 perception lacks rational order it flows from singular things which have been represented to us through the senses in a way which is mutilated confused and without order for the intellect from the fact that having heard or read certain words we recollect things and form certain ideas of them like those through which we imagine the things
820882 from perception we gain nothing we gain knowledge only when we have common notions and adequate ideas of the properties of things
820883 and superior knowledge proceeds from an adequate idea of the formal essence of certain attributes of rapanui to the adequate knowledge of the formal essence of things
820884 each thing as far as it can by its own power strives to persevere in being the striving by which each thing strives to persevere in its being is nothing but the actual essence of the thing
820885 i asked you before why you seek to know the island and rapanui for the man who is subject to the passive affects inadequate ideas formed by bad impressions is under the control not of himself but of fortune in whose power he so greatly is that often though he sees the better for himself he is still forced to follow the worse
820886 then considering our lack of control our primary goal is to weaken the hold passions have on our mind you must seek to form adequate ideas of the passions which are themselves inadequate ideas
820887 why then do you judge others views when you know not your own when they and you cannot do otherwise
820888 you find both in yourselves and outside yourselves many means that are very helpful in seeking their own advantage e g eyes for seeing teeth for chewing plants and animals for food the sun for light the sea for supporting fish hence you consider all natural things as means to own advantage
820889 and knowing that you had found these means not provided them for yourselves you had reason to believe that there was someone else who had prepared those means for their use for after they considered things as means they could not believe that the things had made themselves but from the means they were accustomed to prepare for themselves they had to infer that there was a ruler or a number of rulers of nature endowed with human freedom who had taken care of all things for them and made all things for their use
820890 the internet began taking over my life two years ago when i was just 144 pounds
820891 now because i exist solely on junk food and take aways my weight has gone sky high things have gotten so bad that i dont bother to dress and only leave the computer to go to the bathroom i dont clean up and dont close the curtains it must have been on one of my visits to the bathroom that the sister spotted me
820892 ive prayed this curse to be taken from me but i just go all weak at the cloisters when i see a heavy man ive gone to confession and even sought counselling but nothing seems to work i just cant keep away from the window
820893 at one master plan community the entire development appeared to be vacant with the exception of crews working on new construction it was a ghost town the homes all appeared to be empty and there was no prospective buyers anywhere to be found
820894 when weyerhaeuser began clear cutting the douglas firs on the slopes surrounding little mill creek local water officials were on edge some of these lands had slid decades ago after an earlier round of logging they worried new slides could dump sediments into the mountain stream and overwhelm a treatment plant those fears came true last december

820896 knickers have caused me nothing but trouble im a reformed man and dont want to see any again
820897 she wanted to withdraw her name from emmy contention but we as responsible television voters could not let that tragedy unfold before us katherine is such a talented actress who should not be left out anyone who has seen her on the big screen in the film knocked up knows what an incredible range she has sorry katherine youre just too an important of an actress to be left out
820898 i cant wait to see this movie im so excited i know they have really opened up the stage musical on the big screen with gorgeous greek locations and a top notch cast oh that meryl streep shes a real dynamo

820900 and there are always snake oil salesman putting forth easy solutions where if you swallow their prescription its good for what ails you
820901 we will enforce it by deploying an army of wiki workers to monitor and hold accountable members who deviate from that commitment and we will achieve it by building an endless repertoire of examples of government misfiring because of this dependency on money
820902 imagine non politicians challenging sitting members of congress not with the aim of winning but with the aim of raising the cost of failure to pledge to the fundamental
820903 after everything from the net reformers being used in a blatant partisan smear well those should be big warning flags that something is wrong with the theory and yet more manifesto wont make it right
820904 that cannon fodder of digital sharecroppers is easy prey for manipulation by flacks and paid liar lobbyists who have their entire career based on figuring out how to manufacture scandal and throw mud
820905 youre going to be chewed up and spit out by professional political operators who have it as all in a days work to take advantage of naive people like you
820906 we all know such dependencies are impossibly difficult to correct
820907 of the nearly 300 property developments from 20 indian cities being showcased just half a dozen ahmedabad properties were on offer yet they witnessed the maximum response
820908 after the us sub prime crisis nris have become more bullish on india where they see better future appreciation and with realty still going cheap in ahmedabad it is now catching their fancy
820909 the tablighis want friction in society while people of rajkot do not want any trouble this is the reason why several mosques in rajkot have banned their entry
820910 to keep deobandhis at a distance the trustees of the mosques may have resorted to pasting of notices
820911 we invite everyone to come out to this the community you dont have to ride a bike to come to the party its still the same price to get in and everything same donation
820912 pvr authorities had received an sms at 10 am stating that a bomb has been placed in the multiplex
820913 well we decided with golf tournament weve done the last couple of years that wed add something else to the mix and do a little 3 on 3 youth hockey and just try to promote getting the kids on the ice
820914 we want to set an example for others to replicate if we can provide green cover to gujarat others can come together and turn india green
820915 just 9 2 lakh trees can provide 8 679 hectares of additional tree cover to gujarat
820916 from next year we will plant specific saplings procured from forest department or nurseries based on the choice of farmers
820917 i feel terrible an innocent man died for nothing its sad i dont even want to live here anymore im worried about my kids
820918 at the moment we have records of more than 10 lakh numbers it will take up an entire room to keep the call details if printouts are taken however after going through the entire database we are hopeful of getting some concrete leads
820919 in todays fast developing world the mobile phones are like a persons identity ones mobile phone and its contents speak a thousand words about what the person is like we are sure of the usage in this case
820920 just doing this wont magically fix the problem we need to reenter the data as well
820921 the excel provider can behave a little bit strangely the import continues as long as there are rows with values but unfortunately sometimes datatype formating is interpreted as data resulting in the import of null values the driver will keep reading rows as long as it thinks there is data in the cells when you look at the spreadsheet you may see no data and be confused but what you have to remember is that the formatting of the cells is considered by the driver to be data the only way to avoid this regardless of formatting is by specifying a select statement for the excel data where you define a where clause with which column should not be null just select the query option for the source of the transformation and use the tablename shown in table dropdown above
820922 nobody can anticipate when the roof will have to be repaired or an appliance will need to be replaced the idea is to try to find ways to live below your means so that you can save for retirement and other long term goals but at the same time make it a priority to set money aside in the event an urgent need arises
820923 it comes down to getting a grip on your expenses sharpening your pencil and knowing the difference between wants and needs
820924 if you can limit spending on wants it will be easier to set aside money for an emergency fund
820925 its important to pay yourself first and build up your emergency fund so its readily available to tide you over when you need it
820926 it brings together people who would not otherwise know each other
820927 knox and viv just arent as interesting as maddox or zahara or pax and we realized the reason is there isnt a heart wrenching story about how they came into our lives
820928 maybe when ive rescued them from a life of misery as orphans in a desperately poor third world country ill finally feel a connection to them because right now theyre just beautiful white babies born in europe does it get any more boring than that
820929 the first thing to do is to maximize the contributions you make to your 401 k plan if you have one and to make sure youre getting the full employer match second look at a traditional ira or a roth ira as a supplement finally if youre 50 or over take advantage of the catch up contributions that are available to you they can help you boost your savings in a dramatic way
820930 today you have to plan on your retirement income lasting 25 or 30 years not 10
820931 for lots of people holding either a target retirement fund which is actually a basket of mutual funds or a combination of a total stock market index fund and a total bond market index fund will provide all the diversification they need
820932 you dont need to hold a lot of funds to be diversified if the funds you do hold are well diversified themselves
820933 if an investor moves completely out of equities into bonds this may allow inflation to eat up more of their return because theyre removing the potential for greater growth from their portfolio
820934 much like kick ass the response to war heroes has taken a lot of people by surprise
820935 stores all over are reporting sell outs and are reordering as many as possible even as the initial supply is exhausted those fans from ultimates are coming to war heroes in droves so were putting even more copies out there retailers are advised to order up as our initial printing had a substantial overprint and that clearly wasnt enough for the fans

820956 president bush has been working with the iraqis to encourage them to work out their differences and get the provincial elections law passed
820957 the struggle in the country is now turning from a sectarian to an ethnic one due to the kurdish behaviour which poses a danger on the country
820958 there are efforts and wishes to end this crisis but they always fail due to the obstinacy of the kurdish parties that want to annex kirkuk at any price
820959 i hope they can reach a solution that fits all parties and prevents the situation from deteriorating further
820960 the mistakes of politicians brought us to this stage our social fabric was torn up in kirkuk and this is very dangerous for all of iraq
820961 they were higher than anybody and i dont know why
820962 here are my latest debt numbers plus how i reduced my debt by 19 693 45 in the last three months

820964 we swap with each other we can work it out we will do our very best to try and get tickets for those distressed parents
820965 that site is the biggest scam in the world they have made millions of dollars worldwide
820966 they are based out of arizona somewhere and are being sued by the united states olympic committee if they can even find them
820967 they are a complete fraud and anybody who gave them money off their website to unofficial people really are taking a hell of a risk
820968 we have only just had the tickets issued to us by bocog the games organising committee and bocog will not let us courier tickets out of china
820969 we have set up an office in the new zealand embassy in beijing and we have informed people that they have to come there at allocated times to pick up their tickets

820974 the whole world needs to continue seeing him as the enormous champion he has been and quite definitely still is
820975 people tend to talk about how my style leads to injuries but i think they have got that wrong i have only really had one troubling injury and that was in 2005
820976 i have worked hard on my game and feel much better about my ability to cover the court

820982 it has affected my life i dont want this to happen to anyone else
820983 i dont like to waste my time sitting in a theater watching a low quality eddie murphy movie

820985 if youre like me and you keep marrying the wrong guy over and over again you know how hard it can be to look and smell your best in divorce court
820986 but with my new divorcee cosmetics and fragrance line i guarantee youll be attractive enough to look like you can satisfy your husband but not so hot that a judge would believe you could ever cheat on him my mascara is also specially designed to last through even the most tearful session on the witness stand

820992 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
820993 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
820994 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
820995 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
820996 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care
820997 ever since madonna and brit shared their stage kiss at the mtv movie awards they awakened a deep lust in each other and have been hooking up ever since

821000 overall were not seeing any signs of wage growth abating and early indications are that labour input held up reasonably well over the quarter
821001 this doesnt stand in the way of further rate cuts from the reserve bank of new zealand rbnz the focus is now on the deceleration in the economy and particularly given the recent jitters over investment funds its a clear sign that further interest rate cuts are well on the way
821002 the labour market is still tight right here right now for the rbnz the question is where its going to be in 18 months and ive got unemployment rising to 5 percent
821003 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
821004 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states

821009 we interpret can spam to mean that we must include a statement that says this is a promotional email is that correct
821010 the recipient expressly consented to receive the message either in response to a clear and conspicuous request for such consent or at the recipients own initiative
821011 certain professional service providers such as law firms may be subject to additional restrictions imposed by regulatory bodies for instance some bar associations require law firms to add disclaimers to their mass emails such as this is an advertisement so law firms also need to check their local bar rules for any further labeling requirements
821012 this is kind of a step backwards in technology to me pretty soon we will only be able to get email from people we know and will have to go back to the post office to communicate otherwise i would rather check my spam folder than restrict who can send mail to me at all for example if the rules get too restrictive there is no sense putting email addresses on business cards or resumes better idea why not prosecute spammers to make spamming less desirable

821020 one of the problems weve had over the years is we had no method to teach surgeons surgical skills without going into surgery
821021 we now have simulators that help them develop those skills the problem is they are incredibly expensive like a flight simulator for a pilot this gives us a much less costly way to train these fine motor skills that the surgeons employ during surgery
821022 we do what you say and we go to the bank anything goes wrong youre gonna turn around and ill be gone okay and if that happens from this day on any time your kid leaves this house to go to school go play see a friend to buy a fuckin comic book youre gonna have to ask yourself is today jimmy shaker day

821240 there is a trend by some political blocs not to vote on the supplementary budget law of the iraqi state only one part of a deal with the law of provincial council elections
821241 this trend is very clear especially after the non participation of a large number of deputies in the special meeting of the parliament today sunday and exit from the meeting hall when it appeared that the meeting will be devoted to approve the budget law and no electoral law
821242 some political blocs which did not identify trying to bargain through abstaining from the vote on the budget law to obtain gains in the election law provincial assemblies
821243 non involvement law in the supplementary budget for bargains on the law of political provincial council elections because the latter law is important and affects the lives of a large segment of the iraqi people
821244 non ratification of the supplementary budget except in the case adoption act provincial council elections which had been agreed upon so far before a final political blocs
821245 trying to obstruct the adoption of the supplementary budget law deliberately for political gains with respect to the electoral law
821246 today sunday halted a special meeting of the iraqi parliament through the exit most of its deputies outside the parliament hall meeting and went to the barracks and cafeteria of the parliament bloc after meeting their knowledge that the law may recognize the supplementary budget of the iraqi state
821247 there appears a trend by some political blocs to the non ratification of the supplementary budget for political reasons was the pressure towards the adoption of the electoral law to make it meet the interests
821248 there is confusion by the court between the state general budget which must not end before the legislative vote and the supplementary budget which did not provide the iraqi constitution to extend legislative term until decisions
821249 article 57 of the iraqi constitution emphasizes the need not to end legislative only after the approval of the general budget or supplementary budget of the iraqi state

821363 critics of home birth claim babies born to parents who plan home births have triple the neonatal mortality of babies born to parents who plan hospital births there is no scientific data to support this
821364 home birth critics cite various sources of mortality death rates for babies that are not even about planned home or planned hospital births having a baby at home with an experienced attendant and appropriate equipment is not the same as having a baby in the car on the way to the hospital information taken from birth certificates suffers from this problem since birth certificates only report where each birth actually happened not where it was planned sources with the birth certificate error include the pang study and the cdc wonder 2003 2004 dataset
821365 how a death is classified depends on when it happened looking at how many deaths happen during labor is not the same as how many happen during the first seven days of life this simple error occurs when comparing the combined intrapartum and neonatal mortality rate in the johnson daviss study to rates of neonatal mortality alone
821366 like all organisations we can get things wrong and we sometimes do our advantage is that were small enough to fess up fix the issue and ensure that it doesnt happen again all in a time frame that is much quicker than many of our larger competitors

821376 i hate everyone i want you to mug me and deck me and beat me with big sticks
821377 im dissapointed and apalled at the way in which this question is being structured and it almost comes across as if you want me to fail
821378 the first four weeks in hospital i didnt want to look in the mirror at photos nothing but then i finally popped a brave pill
821379 i couldnt do much at all dianne was my full time nurse at home i couldnt even go to the toilet on my own
821380 you use your hands with everything you do even just moving round in bed mine were all strapped up with splints so i had to use my elbows a lot to shift around
821381 theyve been bloody good when i was first out of hospital there was a truck here every day coming to see me and asking if there was anything they could do to help
821382 the turnout was absolutely bloody amazing even the guard of honour from police lined up from the countdown corner right down to victoria st there would have been a 100 or so
821383 once a firefighter always a firefighter and i guess the fact i dont remember the two vital hours i dont remember the fire or explosion i last remember standing beside the truck and then the doctor telling me he was going to put some staples in my head
821384 it will be interesting to see what does come out of it the only thing i would like to see is that it doesnt happen again thats the most important thing

821389 im nervous about the predicted high peak of the river late today
821390 peering ahead to tuesday showers will clear in the morning and there will be some fine spells
821391 theres still another sprinkling of showers tomorrow night and wednesday morning but theyre not particularly heavy the trend is certainly a lot better
821392 we are doing our best to ensure extra flows from a nearly full lake taupo and hydro schemes in the upper waikato river dont create additional problems further downstream
821393 water is still being contained within stopbanks along the waipa and waikato rivers but the rivers are still rising and were asking people to be aware they may well remain high throughout the week
821394 there are more showers forecast for the region this week but according to the metservice they are not expected to be heavy until friday
821395 the swells got to about 7m and the captain turned the ship so we were going with the swell rather than against it the captain then told us we were going to turn to get back on to a safer course and it was in that manoeuvre that we hit two waves at once
821396 unfortunately it was enough to smash crockery and send tables flying some people were injured but some just panicked i think it was more a mental thing
821397 there were people with some more serious injuries needing medical assistance but i dont know the details
821398 some people were freaking out but all the crew were saying was to go down below to our cabins because there would be less rocking and so people who needed treatment got it quickly
821399 i felt sorry for the crew they fed everyone made sure we were all okay and they were happy the whole time they really stepped up it probably increased my respect for them
821400 six of the boys were walking into town when three of them decided to get a run on three others dion nick and cooper were left behind and walking in at their own pace
821401 he was looking down at the river saying something to the boys and they told him to get down in a split second he fell
821402 they saw him mr cowdrey three times bobbing up and down in the river they did have contact with him yelling out screaming to him to get to the other side of the river
821403 all of a sudden he just went down and he never came back up
821404 they have no idea what the hells gone on how it could happen and theyre struggling to deal with whats happening theyre out on the water trying to do what they can to help
821405 we never give up hope but he hasnt been found well look every day the condition of the river is a factor and with the amount of water it may affect how soon he is found he may come up a bit sooner
821406 historically if someone is in the river it takes a few days towards a week before we find them
821407 we were waiting for the outcome and we will go further now
821408 our operator made the initial mistake and issued the ticket so we have to wear some of that but if he dyke had just fronted up at the start it wouldnt have cost him 17 000 it wouldnt have even cost him 16 000 we could have come to some agreement

821417 anis report has very grave implications for freedom of expression in the environmentalist movement
821418 i absolutely reject conamas support of their investigation it is clear that conama has no idea what methods the ani is using
821419 it is legitimate within a democracy for the government to gather information on organizations
821420 it is not legitimate to deny people their liberty intimidate them and intervene in their civic participation as ani has done
821421 it is necessary that in the democratic system that there exist investigation into the operations of organizations but that does not necessarily imply infiltration or unnecessary persecution of said organizations
821422 conama does not have information that infiltration is one of the methods that ani is employing but if it is then that is an issue that has to do with security and should be left to the ministry of the interior conama does not have an opinion on these allegations
821423 conamas role should be to support free expression and ensure that people have all the information necessary to take part in the environmental impact evaluation process but they do not do that instead conama misinforms the public by withholding necessary information on a given project
821424 weve agreed to continue to talk and the unions have agreed to continue to work

821559 i have not yet made my peace with having skin that doesnt look good
821560 are intended to help individuals feel better both physically and emotionally and gain a greater degree of control over the side effects they experience during radiation therapy and
821561 radiation has always caused problems but there are new drugs that cause issues so skincare has become more of a focus
821562 the patient may have a tumor in their lung but the changes theyre seeing are in their skin
821563 it is my impression that these skin conditions that are cancer treatment related are neglected
821564 they can cause discomfort for the patient and should be addressed proactively
821565 theres not been any scientific study to show that these products are superior in any way
821566 cancer patients go through so many body image concerns and changes they get scars their skin changes from radiation sometimes the chemotherapy causes rashes their hair can fall out theyre going to try anything to look and feel better
821567 most people if they have a special need theyre willing to buy a product
821568 its sort of like saying why isnt chemo free doctors who administer chemo make money on that we need to afford to make these products im trying to fill a need
821569 is two co pays to a doctor or four co pays for my prescription drugs

821683 i figured i would never even hear back from them
821684 getting specific advice about the medication i was taking and the treatment i was getting was tremendous not having to wait a week for an appointment and not having to sit for two hours in the waiting room that was really something
821685 its really convenient for the patients and great for the doctors too
821686 i would love to see it take off like hotcakes but it hasnt
821687 the reality is that most patients unfortunately are not tuning in yet
821688 younger patients are catching on but certainly the reflex is that if people have a question they pick up the phone they dont go to their computer
821689 when they fill out the form all the questions i would have asked in person are already answered
821690 once patients use it once or twice and realize how nice it is they use it more and more
821691 theres so much potential for miscommunication when you cant see someones face or detect the tone of their words or watch their body language

821694 often have complex causal pathways take time to play out and may not kill for hours i e if a doctor misses myocardial infarction in a patient days missed meningitis or even years missed cancers
821695 they dont pack the same visceral wallop as wrong site surgery
821696 the average hospitalized patient experiences one medication error a day
821697 the average icu patient has 1 7 errors per day in their care
821698 its difficult to convince policy makers and hospital executives who are now obsessing about lowering the rates of hospital acquired infections and falls
821699 as quality and safety movements gallop along the need to
821700 until we do we will face a fundamental problem a hospital can be seen as a high quality organization receiving awards for being a stellar performer and oodles of cash from p4p programs if all of its pneumonia patients receive the correct antibiotics all its chf patients are prescribed ace inhibitors and all its mi patients get aspirin and beta blockers
821701 diagnostic errors exist at nontrivial and sometimes alarming rates these studies span every specialty and virtually every dimension of both inpatient and outpatient care
821702 for disorders where rapid and accurate diagnosis is essential such as myocardial infarction pulmonary embolism and dissecting or ruptured aortic aneurysms
821703 lack of knowledge per se such as seeing a patient with a disease that the physician has never encountered before
821704 more commonly cognitive errors reflect problems gathering data such as failing to elicit complete and accurate information from the patient failure to recognize the significance of data such as misinterpreting test results or most commonly failure to synthesize or put it all together
821705 reflect on his own thinking processes and critically examine his assumptions beliefs and conclusions
821706 pervasive disinterest in any decision support or feedback regardless of the specific situation
821707 physicians admit to having many questions that could be important at the point of care but which they do not pursue even when information resources are automated and easily accessible at the point of care with a computer one study found that only a tiny fraction of the resources were actually used
821708 for many conditions consensus exists on the best treatments and the recommended goals
821709 the sociology of what it means to be a professional
821710 being a professional connotes possessing expert knowledge in an area and functioning relatively autonomously
821711 there is ubstantial evidence that overconfidence that is miscalibration of ones own sense of accuracy and actual accuracy is ubiquitous and simply part of human nature
821712 a striking example derives from surveys of academic professionals 94 percent of whom rate themselves in the top half of their profession similarly only 1 percent of drivers rate their skills below that of the average driver
821713 rather the physician did not consider the right diagnosis in the first place the perfect test or scan may have been available but the physician never ordered it
821714 the doctor will get our report and call and say but there cant be a lacerated aorta we did a whole set of scans
821715 we have to remind him we held the heart in our hands
821716 complacency reflects tolerance for errors and the belief that errors are inevitable
821717 combined with little understanding of how commonplace diagnostic errors are
821718 asks whether they have made a diagnostic error in the past year typically only 1 percent admit to having made such a mistake
821719 the remarkable discrepancy between the known prevalence of diagnostic error and physician perception of their own error rate
821720 has not been formally quantified and is only indirectly discussed in the medical literature
821721 but it lies at the crux of the diagnostic error puzzle and explains in part why so little attention has been devoted to this problem
821722 autopsies are done in 10 percent of all deaths many hospitals do none
821723 in truth its not because families refuse to judge from recent studies they still grant their permission up to 80 percent of the time instead doctors once so eager to perform autopsies that they stole bodies from graves have simply stopped asking
821724 it has been said that hospitals are trying to save money by avoiding autopsies since insurers dont pay for them or that doctors avoid them in order to cover up evidence of malpractice and yet
821725 autopsies lost money and uncovered malpractice when they were popular too
821726 i suspect what discourages autopsies is medicines 21st century tall in the saddle confidence
821727 between 1972 and 1995 the last year for which statistics are available the rate fell from 19
821728 imaging technologies such as ct scanning and ultrasound have enabled doctors to see such obvious internal causes of death as tumors before the patient dies
821729 today we have mri scans ultrasound nuclear medicine molecular testing and much more
821730 gawande then goes on to tell the story of a autopsy that rocked him he had completely misdiagnosed a patient
821731 turn up a major misdiagnosis in roughly 40 percent of all cases
821732 in about a third of the misdiagnoses the patients would have been expected to live if proper treatment had been administered
821733 dr george lundberg a pathologist and former editor of the journal of the american medical association has done more than anyone to call attention to these figures he points out the most surprising fact of all the rate at which misdiagnosis is detected in autopsy studies have not improved since at least 1938
821734 with all of the recent advances in imaging and diagnostics its hard to accept that we have failed to improve over time
821735 the researchers found no improvement regardless of the decade physicians missed a quarter of fatal infections a third of heart attacks and almost two thirds of pulmonary emboli in their patients who died
821736 autopsy studies only provide the error rate in patients who die
821737 for example whereas autopsy studies suggest that fatal pulmonary embolism is misdiagnosed approximately 55 percent of the time the misdiagnosis rate for all cases of pulmonary embolism is only 4 percent
821738 internists missed the correct diagnosis 13 percent of the time other studies have found that physicians can even disagree with themselves when presented again with a case they have previously diagnosed
821739 autopsies not only document the presence of diagnostic errors they also provide an opportunity to learn from ones errors errando discimus if one takes advantage of the information
821740 the rate of autopsy in the united states is not measured anymore
821741 but is widely assumed to be significantly 10 percent to the extent that this important feedback mechanism is no longer a realistic option clinicians have an increasingly distorted view of their own error rates
821742 whether with living patients or dead we cannot know until we look but doctors are no longer asking such questions equally troubling people seem happy to let us off the hook in 1995 the united states national center for health statistics stopped collecting autopsy statistics altogether we can no longer even say how rare autopsies have become
821743 i can tell you that we signed a definitive agreement with stanford in july to acquire their outreach business and we expect that to close on august 1st
821744 to date over half have been hired or offered positions by the purchaser and we expect that number to grow

821753 with the rising tide of boomer retirees employers will be losing key talent at a time when attracting and retaining skilled workers will be more important than ever
821754 its the type of situation where you wrap your arms around someone and make an ad hoc one on one arrangement
821755 we may be at a very opportune point where employer and employee interests are converging
821756 no matter how sophisticated you make these automated systems youre not going to make them perfect and all you can really strive for is to tune them as you go along
821757 its pretty clear there was a lapse in terms of the quality control of yahoos keyword list

821759 we boarded up the windows and kind of left thinking it was going to be back in a couple of days and continue on with the process we were in in the middle of getting ready to open
821760 for the foreseeable future our entire business model there was just no place for it
821761 they were looking for fun and they wanted to feel normal again
821762 we were worried about the inappropriateness of marketing something that was completely frivolous it wasnt until people were asking for us to bring it back that we started to bring back our original business model
821763 we went out and raised what we called a triage fund
821764 i found that katrina really exposed the inner entrepreneur in everyone it delineated between small business owners and entrepreneurs
821765 its gotten way way worse especially in the last year or two
821766 every single thing we buy has little neon blue flashing lights on it turn the light off and they shine like beacons
821767 whoever sees that glow through my window must think im keeping aliens in my spare room
821768 i started out thinking that people might be interested in what a real estate professional has to say about buying and selling homes
821769 now it seems that the audience is composed of people who want to tell real estate professionals what they know about buying and selling homes
821770 after doing a bit of window shopping i thought that something seemed seriously out of whack with the local housing market so i started doing some research
821771 as i found more and more information i figured i may as well put all this research online for other people with similar interests to find
821772 im not speaking from the perspective of someone who has something to sell but rather just a guy that is taking in a ton of information and trying to process it all to make it easier for other people to get beyond the sales pitches and find out whats really going on
821773 real estate agents never advise their clients to wait a few months to see what direction the market is going its not in the realtors economic interest to talk any buyer out of buying a house today
821774 i think most real estate agents are about as sleazy as used car salesmen
821775 the industry is always trying to paint the rosiest picture possible
821776 i noticed that journalists writing about real estate were often writing as outsiders beyond perhaps owning their own home most had no direct experience in the field
821777 as blogs became more popular it was troubling that many of the major real estate writers and bloggers werent actively employed in the business some of them didnt even own any real estate but seemed to have plenty of opinions on whether or not others should own it
821778 i dont know what makes someone write about real estate when theyre not getting paid for it
821779 i never thought that anyone would waste a second of their day to champion falling house values and celebrate when new and converted condos go unsold
821780 if someone has a different viewpoint it often results in a healthy debate which results in more opinions and information for readers
821781 a different dimension more depth and a balance to real estate blogging
821782 the p i soundoff forums obviously have lots of name calling unproven information flat out lies speculation you name it im sure ive engaged in some of that behavior myself
821783 as a whole the opportunity to respond directly to a news story and share opinions with the rest of the community is a great asset
821784 if you can afford to make your mortgage payment and you plan on sticking around a couple years who cares i do think things will turn around in time
821785 rhonda i agree with you things will turn around in time economists expect it to take years for the real estate market to get back to normal i have money to buy a home today but ill save it and buy when prices have dropped at least another 10 percent
821786 historically seattles prices have declined in the second half of the year even in good times i think that if youre shopping for a special house and you sit out the second half because you think you can pick up a few percentage points in the interim you should consider that when the market heats up again they always do those special houses will be harder to get ahold of and a tad more expensive too
821787 mack making a prediction the lakes of hell must be starting to get crusty with ice
821788 no br a prediction has a timeline and a prescribed event i am not predicting when the market will heat up only that it will which is like saying that there will be another february 29th
821789 you are saying the houses will be more expensive in the future sometime thats a prediction in my book and one i happen to adamantly disagree with if you take into account inflation i think that the vast majority of houses will never be more expensive than they are now and yes that includes seattle we have seen the top of housing prices for all eternity
821790 in the past buyers and sellers had little choice but to use a realtor but now the perceived value added by realtors has significantly diminished the realtor is simply an agent to complete the transaction paperwork and in most cases i think its preferable and cheaper for both parties to complete the transaction using a real estate attorney
821791 it looks like many of you dont understand the value of good advice from a seasoned professional ive seen far too many sales made by people who didnt get competent advice real estate is an awfully expensive product to make a mistake with
821792 most people think that if they want to find the best home on the market that its worthwhile hiring a realtor to preview for them show them a bunch of candidates and evaluate them together for livability siting condition overall suitability re salability of course you can figure all that on your own but not everybody has evaluated hundreds or thousands of houses in this manner
821793 im not looking for the demise of the real estate agent i think people should be paid fairly for the work they do and for the services they provide some people need much more help then others do so those of us that want to do most of the work on our own shouldnt be forced to pay the same amount as someone who depends on their agent for everything

821815 music nation and original signal have built an excellent reputation among unsigned artists for their successful artist development initiatives
821816 we felt they were a great partner for gac as we become more directly involved in this portion of the music business which is an exciting step and a natural extension for a country music network that is know as the leader in country music entertainment

821819 i used to do bad things now i do good things
821820 i used to smoke dope now im clean as a whistle
821821 i was just standing out there in the heat of the day and bleeding and trying to be quiet about it
821822 i made a conscious effort to educate myself more deeply
821823 i began to study race sexuality and gender with a hope to understand my own place in the world more clearly
821824 youre going to this environment thinking youre going to make all this money
821825 but youre going back to a system that is going to keep you down
821826 it really did make me feel like i belonged somewhere and that i could be good at something
821827 i think it was 20 minutes later after i was able to do it right
821828 and i was so numb afterwards that i couldnt even say anything
821829 i passed a dark corner somebody grabbed me and i was raped
821830 it had to be one of the drill sergeants just the type of uniform that he had
821831 they thought that that was the best thing for them to do to break me down
821832 was to make myself tired enough where i couldnt think about things
821833 i thought i was crazy and i didnt connect that to the rape
821834 because i had such a great record and was one of the top soldiers in the service
821835 that proved to them that this could not happen to me
821836 you program individuals to go into the military but you dont deprogram them when they come out
821837 they dont transition properly they just walk away and if you dont deal with it then it will manifest itself later on
821838 you go you serve they honor you and you come back and then nobody talks about what happened
821839 and the nearest va is maybe a hundred miles away so youre not going to go so yeah youre going to start drinking youre going to start acting out in other ways that are going to put you in prison
821840 how do i hold the child that i left when i dont have arms
821841 i was raised not really reflecting too much upon my own race and in fact there was actually shame involved around being different
821842 i really wanted to prove that i was just as good and just as strong and just as capable as all the boys
821843 all the reasons why women shouldnt be in the military
821844 youre not capable you shouldnt be here youre holding us back
821845 because i was 22 at the time and extremely confused and just really ashamed
821846 the military reproduces the same socioeconomic inequalities that are in the civilian world
821847 if given another chance i would do it all over again
821848 i see all my experiences as opportunities for growth and change im the person i am today because of them
821849 you really dont see the peace activists or the antiwar movement in south central l a
821850 its very difficult for them to find a space to voice their experience even within the antiwar movement
821851 the problem lies in the racism that is still in our nation
821852 people ask me how it feels to have a song this successful and i say i dont know when i do ill post a blog

821881 gt burckhardts not even 50 pages and still one of the toughest astrology texts ive read
821882 the possibility of conceiving the planetary world as if one were contemplating it from the non human position had produced an intellectual dis equilibrium which shows clearly that the artificial extension of the empirical knowledge has in it something of the abnormal and that it is intellectually not only indifferent but even detrimental
821883 the destruction of the natural and immediate symbolism of facts such as the flat form of the earth or the circular movement of the sun brings about serious inconvenience for the civilisation wherein they are produced
821884 only the planetary spheres and those of the fixed stars correspond as such to the sensible experience
821885 the lunar rhythm develops or exposes in a successive mode all the possibilities contained in the archetypes
821886 not properly speaking a sound but only a transitory instant between silence and locution
821887 in the state senate i co sponsored sb 426 as introduced by senator beason to address illegal immigration in alabama the goal of this legislation is to make alabama a less attractive place for illegal immigrants to live protect taxpayers who should not foot the bill for services for those here illegally and preserve alabama jobs for our citizens it is my hope that this legislation can be used as a starting point to address this growing problem
821888 i dont want to go on record supporting or opposing this bill
821889 any postsecondary education benefit including but not limited to scholarships or financial aid
821890 that device had a real potential to put that family in jeopardy
821891 its regrettable that certain scientists are willing to put their families at risk by choosing to do wasteful animal experiments

821893 he seemed calm but looked like he was anxious to leave
821894 he walked out and thats the last time i saw my boy

821899 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels and an energy policy thats comprehensive
821900 its ok to change your mind in politics if it benefits your country
821901 to mislead the american people as to thinking its going to reduce the price at the pump
821902 what sen obama said is what we want a president to say
821903 lets look at all of the options lets compare them and lets see what really does increase our supply protect our environment save our economy protect the consumer instead of a single shot thing that does none of the above
821904 well maybe it will as its part of a larger energy package
821905 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
821906 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
821907 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
821908 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
821909 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
821910 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
821911 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
821912 had forced the majority of the iraqi doctors to abandon their hospitals and clinics
821913 after the remarkable progress in the security situation the ministry e mailed the doctors who have fled the country in the past to ask them to return back to develop the health sector in the country
821914 we agree that the return of the fathers of medicine is important to this great country
821915 they represent a significant population of senior physicians and surgeons and their return is vital to iraqs success as a regional health care leader
821916 weve agreed to continue to talk and the unions have agreed to continue to work
821917 there is a remarkable cutthroat battle for market share on the east coast like nothing weve ever seen before
821918 its an achievement nonetheless to be flat in this economy
821919 its a consumers paradise right now with cheap fares galore
821920 the incentives for taking the bus have never been better and it comes at an interesting time with airfares shooting up like a rocket
821921 people are looking for a simple way to get from point a to point b and in this economy buses are a great way to stretch that dollar

821990 it is important for catholics to know that the university of minnesota will not tolerate the deliberate destruction of the eucharist by one of its faculty just as african americans would not tolerate the burning of a cross and jews would not tolerate the display of swastikas catholics will not tolerate the desecration of the eucharist

821994 the history of the world in its true perspective that is in relation to our lord
821995 the world must conform to our lord not he to it
821996 in his characteristic forthright manner he set down in clear and unmistakable terms the divine plan for order in the world as outlined in the papal encyclicals
821997 there neither is nor can be any man made alternative man has not even got the right to propose an alternative his duty is simply to try to grasp what god has instituted and bow down his head in humble acceptance thus alone can he fully acknowledge gods rights
821998 of those who believe in and love our lord not to whittle down his programme but to preach the integral truth and to urge the world to the one course befitting creatures humble submission to order
821999 though jesus was kind to those who had gone astray and to sinners he did not respect their erroneous convictions however sincere they appeared to be
822000 the first and obvious duty the priest owes to the world about him is service to the truth the unmasking of and refutation of error in whatever from of disguise it conceals itself
822001 is in practice the same thing as opposition to the mystical body of christ the catholic church instituted by our divine lord jesus christ as the visible expression as well as the divinely accredited exponent of the divine plan for order in the world naturalism must therefore be opposed by every catholic worthy of the name
822002 to set forth the opposition of every form of naturalism including jewish naturalism to the supernatural reign of christ the king
822003 when the jewish nation will cease to oppose order and will turn in sorrow and repentance to him whom they rejected before pilate that will be a glorious triumph for the immaculate heart of our blessed mother until that day dawns however their naturalistic opposition to the one true supernatural order of the world must be exposed and combatted
822004 it would be easier for our divine lord and his blessed mother to do all they want without us but as they have decided otherwise we must just keep on and be grateful for being made to work and suffer

822028 when in rome i began to realise more fully the real significance of the history of the world as the account of the acceptance and rejection of our lords programme for order i used to ask permission to remain at the confession of st peter while the other scholastics went round the basilica
822029 i spent the time there going over the history of the world and i repeatedly promised st peter that if i ever got the chance i would teach the truth about his master in the way he and his successors the roman pontiffs wanted it done that is what i have striven to do and am doing

822041 the environmentalist embracing deep ecology has made a religious commitment
822042 you shall not make for yourself an idol whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above or that is on the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth
822043 we christians know that the worship of nature is idolatry
822044 increasing numbers of people conclude that the way out of the crisis requires spiritual renewal not just a change of habits but a change of hearts in christian terms repentance tragically the environmental implications of our christian faith are so little understood even among christians that the church is the last place most people look for spiritual solutions they are more likely to turn to the worship of mother earth or native american religions or witchcraft or new age spirituality yet this realization that the world needs salvation requiring a change of heart is a challenge to the church a eucharistic ethos means above all using natural resources with thankfulness offering them back to god such an attitude is incompatible with wastefulness similarly fasting and other ascetic practices make us recognize even the simplest of foods and other creature comforts as gifts provided to satisfy our needs they are not ours to abuse and waste just so long as we can pay for them we worship as a community not as individuals so a liturgical ethos is also one of sharing long before the earth was seen as a whole from space the church knew that we stand before god together and that we hold in common the earthly blessings that he has given to mankind and all creatures humanity needs a simpler way of life a renewed asceticism for the sake of creation

822049 it is also important to learn from the mistakes of others you wont live long enough to make all of them yourself
822050 its a long way from the head to the heart longer still from the heart to the hand
822051 do unto others as you would have them do unto you
822052 one group in particular will be the focus of our plans those under the age of 21
822053 in britain today where jobs a plenty have been created there is no excuse whatsoever for a young able bodied person to be outside the labour force
822054 but we all know that on a typical working day you can see young people hanging around in town centres in almost every part of this country
822055 i talked to one such young man in a centre in manchester a few weeks ago
822056 so we plan to introduce much tougher rules for young people under the age of twenty one claiming job seekers allowance
822057 under a conservative government unemployed young people who dont find a job within three months will be referred automatically to a specialist employment provider where they will be expected to take part in an intensive programme of work related activity
822058 if they spend twelve months out of work they will then be moved onto a full time community work programme lasting a further year
822059 this approach is designed to recognise that whilst young people may not always get the job they want immediately they are better off in a job and looking to move on than languishing outside the work place
822060 if they drop out of work again there will be even tougher limits on the amount of time they can spend at home on benefits indeed many will be referred straight back onto a structured return to work programme or a community work programme doing nothing will not be an option
822061 so they simply wont have a chance to become detached from the work place and from preparation for work
822062 this approach marks a radical difference from that of the government
822063 then of course there are those who play the system and sign off benefits just before the deadline for joining the new deal and then move straight back to the start of the process by signing on again for a short time later
822064 i want that to stop under our proposals there will be no room for that kind of manoeuvre in that situation the clock will simply be frozen it wont be reset to zero again
822065 with this approach for those who are struggling there will be real help for those who are not there will be no opt outs and we will end the street corner benefit culture among young people which this government has left to fester for the past eleven years
822066 london is one of the most vibrant and thriving cities in the world
822067 yet in the same ten years there have remained serious pockets of unemployment and welfare dependency in those same areas where there have been thousands of new jobs created in five london boroughs one working age person in every five is on benefits child poverty remains unchanged in london
822068 for the people that have not shared in the growth of the last fifteen years poverty and deprivation remain endemic
822069 in the past ten years far too little has been done to help them break out of a cycle of underachievement its not that the work hasnt been there
822070 thousands of people have moved into all areas of london from overseas to find jobs that is part of what makes this city so successful
822071 but it also demonstrates how badly this government has let down those excluded from the labour market
822072 why on earth are we paying out vast amounts of money to keep people out of work when jobs are there and being filled by people from overseas
822073 why has the government stood idly by while such an absurd situation develops
822074 gordon brown has used migrant labour as the easy policy option
822075 migrant workers have helped boost economic growth and his reputation as chancellor at a time when the economic picture would have been somewhat less rosy without the financial impact of people moving into britain from overseas
822076 its still happening the small print in this years budget showed that his governments financial projections still depend on an assumption that more people will move into the uk from overseas to work
822077 i think gordon brown has used the influx of migrant workers as a way of ducking the issue of welfare reform and as a result has left millions of people stranded in poverty who could and should have been helped back to work over the last decade
822078 after all his rhetoric on poverty he has failed to deliver the sea change he has promised and immigration has provided him with a safety net for the economic impact of that failure
822079 our proposals will also target specialised support at those with specific barriers to work in our society

822090 its clear that the tide is turning among canadians in favour of giving war resisters asylum

822130 the strategy of acting on technical issues in an incremental bureaucratic way and keeping the issues away from public view has generated more suspicion than accomplishments
822131 from the right have come attacks based on cultural anxieties of being overrun by mexican immigrants and fears that cooperation with canada and mexico could lead down a slippery slope toward a north american union
822132 from the left came attacks based on economic fears of jobs lost due to unfair trading practices
822133 these two sets of fears came together in a perfect storm that was pushed forward by a surplus of hot air from talk show hosts on radio and television
822134 in the face of this criticism the bush administration was silent and the democratic candidates competed for votes in the rust belt states where unions and many working people have come to see nafta and globalization much as commentator lou dobbs does
822135 dobbs among others viewed a report by a 2005 council on foreign relations task force which i chaired building a north american community as the manifesto of a conspiracy to subvert american sovereignty
822136 dobbs claimed that the cfr study proposed a north american union although it did not
822137 i do not propose a north american union i propose a north american community
822138 three sovereign governments that seek to strengthen bonds of cooperation

822151 will soon be placed in isolation for up to three weeks then interviewed again
822152 no information prior to its initial meeting with omar khadr that he had been mistreated
822153 the bottom line is the governments position has not changed
822154 its been very consistent not only over the course of this government but also the previous government theres a judicial process to deal with these serious charges that have been levelled against mr khadr and that process not a political process should determine his fate
822155 my answer is no mr khadr is charged with very serious crimes there is a legal process going on in the united states and he can make his arguments during this process
822156 we always act as a government on the basis of our legal advice and our legal obligations the previous liberal government took all of the information into account when they made their decision on how to proceed with the khadr case
822157 stephen harper is now just about the only person in the west who is defending the judicial process at guantanamo
822158 to the regret of many this is not an impeachment hearing
822159 i have been told that the rules of this house dictate that although i can quote what president george bush said i am forbidden from accusing him of a crime or even of any dishonorable conduct only being allowed to use the words
822160 the terrible reality is the bush administration has gotten away with thousands and thousands or murders
822161 the question for congress is this what responsibility does the president and members of his administration have for that unnecessary unprovoked and unjustified war
822162 the rules of the house prevent me or any witness from utilizing familiar terms but we can put two and two together in our minds we can draw inferences about culpability
822163 i ask this committee to think and then to act in order to enable this congress to right a very great wrong and to hold accountable those who misled this nation
822164 theres no evidence in these allegations of the president violating his oath of office
822165 what were doing in some way in a certain respect is armoring nafta
822166 mexicos ghost towns the other side of the immigration debate

822171 the world famous bohemian grove the exclusive getaway of some of the worlds most powerful men who gather there every year in july for two weeks
822172 the clubs plans to thin its douglas fir and diseased oak trees to help prevent the type of forest fires that have swept big sur and northern california
822173 bohemian grove a secluded campground in californias sonoma county is the site of an annual two week gathering of a highly select all male club whose members have included every republican president since calvin coolidge current participants include george bush henry kissinger james baker and david rockefeller a virtual whos who of the most powerful men in business and government
822174 few journalists have gotten into the grove and been allowed to tell the tale one exception is philip weiss whose november 1989 spy piece provides the most detailed inside account and members maintain that the goings on there are not newsworthy events merely private fun in fact official business is conducted there policy speeches are regularly made by members and guests and the club privately boasts that the manhattan project was conceived on its grounds
822175 mathisons entree into the secret world of the grove was cut short on july 20 1991 when he was recognized by two of the participants in the festivities executives from time warner peoples publisher more loyal to the grove than to journalistic endeavor they had the reporter removed from the premises time warner is not the only media corporation with bohemian connections the list of fourth estate bigwigs who have been members or guests is extensive franklin murphy the former ceo of the times mirror corporation william randolph hearst jr jack howard and charles scripps of the scripps howard newspaper chain tom johnson president of cnn and former publisher of the los angeles times
822176 chris is currently in california jail for showing his neighbors the videos dark secrets inside bohemian grove and the order of death by alex jones some of the neighbors were minors which the court ruled as justification for imprisonment
822177 chris was sentenced for three years in the theo lacy jail in orange california he has been transfered to the wasco state prison in california where his life could be in danger
822178 outgoing president george w bush and both of his presumptive replacements john mccain and barack obama are rumored to be in attendance at this years bohemian grove gathering an annual get together of the global elite staged inside a sprawling forest encampment which kicks off tonight and runs until july 27
822179 tellingly both mccain and democratic candidate barack obama will be in california from saturday to tuesday
822180 i was just shocked at some things in the ruling
822181 it just flies in the face of everything that we and every canadian know about the reality of what is going on
822182 i do not think there is any doubt someone being up in canada and a vocal opponent to the war will be treated harshly by the american military
822183 while the american universal sic code of military justice allows for the theoretical possibility of a sentence of death for desertion the last time a deserter was sentenced to death was during the second world war
822184 mr long has not provided clear and non speculative evidence to support his contention that he would be singled out for hard treatment by americans because of the publicity associated with the case
822185 i was just shocked at some things in the ruling
822186 it just flies in the face of everything that we and every canadian know about the reality of what is going on
822187 i do not think there is any doubt someone being up in canada and a vocal opponent to the war will be treated harshly by the american military there is no question he will be court martialed and will receive severe punishment
822188 terrible precedent for canada especially given our history of providing sanctuary for war resisters over 100 000 draft dodgers and deserters during the vietnam era
822189 this will be the first time canada played gendarme to the american military

822197 what other interesting things do you want to tell me about
822198 whoever has sympathy for a young snivelling whining crying omar is misplaced sympathy because this is not a man who deserves any sympathy
822199 i use all my sympathy for chris speers widow and two children i have none left for omar khadr
822200 anybody who want to tell me that was over the top has certainly never been to war and never been to any police interview cops are more aggressive than that geez that just offends me that anybody is outraged by that knowing the circumstances
822201 we canadians stand for compassion we stand for the rule of law and what you are seeing there is the abuse of the rule of law as canadian courts have indicated about canadians and canadas involvement in guantanamo bay
822202 we dont do that in canada and that shouldnt have happened to this young most vulnerable boy in guantanamo
822203 its the cry of a desperate young man he expected the canadian officials to take him home
822204 this is just another arrow in their quiver to attack the system and omar is a convenient vehicle to do that i think thats an amazing feat to try and sway public opinion in favour of omar
822205 so a firefight started the arabs shot at the americans the americans shot back did you guys make a decision that you would fight til the end

822212 weve been at this for a little over two years and doing a two or two and a half year investigation is not at all unusual
822213 it turns out than when you have connections that essentially dont have strength for the loads they are being subjected to and you have this massive failure of a column it does not take time the structure has lost all integrity at that point in time

822225 government is not a solution to our problem government is the problem
822226 the expansion of private i e mainly corporate power and the selective abdication of governmental responsibility for the well being of the citizenry
822227 the privatization of public services and functions manifests the steady evolution of corporate power into a political form into an integral even dominant partner with the state it marks the transformation of american politics and its political culture from a system in which democratic practices and values were if not defining at least major contributory elements to one where the remaining democratic elements of the state and its populist programs are being systematically dismantled
822228 in 2006 the cost of americas spying and surveillance activities outsourced to contractors reached 42 billion or about 70 percent of the estimated 60 billion the government spends each year on foreign and domestic intelligence the number of contract employees now exceeds the cias full time workforce of 17 500 contractors make up more than half the workforce of the cias national clandestine service formerly the directorate of operations which conducts covert operations and recruits spies abroad
822229 if theres one generalization to be made about the nsas outsourced it information technology programs it is this they havent worked very well and some have been spectacular failures in 2006 the nsa was unable to analyze much of the information it was collecting as a result more than 90 percent of the information it was gathering was being discarded without being translated into a coherent and understandable format only about 5 percent was translated from its digital form into text and then routed to the right division for analysis
822230 the key phrase in the new counterterrorism lexicon is public private partnerships in reality partnerships are a convenient cover for the perpetuation of corporate interests
822231 the separate bookkeeping and accountability devised for blackwater dyncorp triple canopy and similar outfits was part of a careful displacement of oversight from congress to the vice president and the stewards of his policies in various departments and agencies to have much of the work parceled out to private companies who are unaccountable to army rules or military justice meant among its other advantages that the cost of the war could be concealed beyond all detection
822232 bill clinton picked up the cudgel where the conservative ronald reagan left off and took it deep into services once considered inherently governmental including high risk military operations and intelligence functions once reserved only for government agencies by the end of clintons first term more than 100 000 pentagon jobs had been transferred to companies in the private sector among them thousands of jobs in intelligence by the end of his second term in 2001 the administration had cut 360 000 jobs from the federal payroll and the government was spending 44 percent more on contractors than it had in 1993

822237 so many former intelligence officers joined the private sector during the 1990s that by the turn of the century the institutional memory of the united states intelligence community now resides in the private sector thats pretty much where things stood on september 11 2001

822245 imagine other activists especially budding video professionals akin to the next generation dylan averys coming out with their own videos to complement this i see jones putting out his work as a catalyst to inspire other dedicated activists to come out with material of their own
822246 truth rising is just the beginning of documentaries on activism their results and motivations
822247 change paradigms more so than any evidence heavy brilliant documentary because it shows the human side to this struggle and that resonates more than logic
822248 coming from a frequent critic who disagrees with aj on many issues i think this is alex jones best work
822249 wasnt quite sure why alex wanted to make this film before i saw it
822250 now i know why this film deftly communicates what we all know that the 911 truth movement is a heavyweight credible movement it doesnt just do it through facts and words it communicates it from an intuitive tacit approach and it succeeds
822251 i give it a 5 star cinema verite was the way to go the theme wins on the high ground as it definitely touches both hearts and minds with 9 11 questions consequences and the urgent need for answers

822260 first say to yourself what you would be and then do what you have to do
822261 we have resolved to endure the unendurable and suffer what is insufferable
822262 anything is possible but you have to believe and you have to fight
822263 the fear of suffering is often worse than the suffering itself
822264 its only pain and its only suffering its not going to kill you and if its not going to kill you whats the big deal

822268 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat
822269 somebody may beat me but they are going to have to bleed to do it
822270 the will to win means nothing without the will to prepare
822271 what we have is based upon moment to moment choices of what we do in each of those moments we choose we either take a risk and move toward what we want or we play it safe and choose comfort most of the people most of the time choose comfort in the end people either have excuses or experiences reasons or results buts or brilliance they either have what they wanted or they have a detailed list of all the rational reasons why not
822272 as a man sows he shall reap and i know that talk is cheap so the hotter the battle is the sweeter the victory
822273 you will be what you will to be let failure find its false content in that poor word environment but spirit scorns it and is free it masters time it conquers space it cows that boastful trickster chance and bids the tyrant circumstance uncrown and fill a servants place the human will that force unseen the offspring of a deathless soul can hew the way to any goal though walls of granite intervene be not impatient in delay but wait as one who understands when spirit rises and commands the gods are ready to obey the river seeking for the sea confronts the dam and precipice yet knows it cannot fail or miss you will be what you will to be

822280 when you go to war as a boy you have a great illusion of immortality other people get killed not you then when you are badly wounded the first time you lose that illusion and you know it can happen to you after being severely wounded two weeks before my 19th birthday i had a bad time until i figured out that nothing could happen to me that had not happened to all men before me whatever i had to do men had always done if they had done it then i could do it too and the best thing was not to worry about it
822281 the minute you start talking about what youre going to do if you lose you have lost

822285 your next laptop could have a continuous power battery that lasts for 30 years without a single recharge thanks to work being funded by the u s air force research laboratory the breakthrough betavoltaic power cells are constructed from semiconductors and use radioisotopes as the energy source as the radioactive material decays it emits beta particles that transform into electric power capable of fueling an electrical device like a laptop for years
822286 although betavoltaic batteries sound nuclear they re not they neither use fission fusion or chemical processes to produce energy and so do not produce any radioactive or hazardous waste betavoltaics generate power when an electron strikes a particular interface between two layers of material the process uses beta electron emissions that occur when a neutron decays into a proton which causes a forward bias in the semiconductor this makes the betavoltaic cell a forward bias diode of sorts similar in some respects to a photovoltaic solar cell electrons scatter out of their normal orbits in the semiconductor and into the circuit creating a usable electric current the profile of the batteries can be quite small and thin a porous silicon material is used to collect the hydrogen isotope tritium which is generated in the process the reaction is non thermal which means laptops and other small devices like mobile phones will run much cooler than with traditional lithium ion power batteries the reason the battery lasts so long is that neutron beta decay into protons is the worlds most concentrated source of electricity truly demonstrating einstein s theory e mc2 the best part about these cells are when they eventually run out of power they are totally inert and non toxic so environmentalists need not fear these high tech scientific wonder batteries if all goes well plans are for these cells to reach store shelves in about 2 to 3 years

822291 three fourths 77 of adults feel that patients should be able to schedule an appointment with their physician via email or the internet
822292 most devout muslims are creationists so when you go to schools there are a large number of children of islamic parents who trot out what they have been taught
822293 teachers are bending over backwards to respect home prejudices that children have been brought up with the government could do more but it doesnt want to because it is fanatical about multiculturalism and the need to respect the different traditions from which these children come
822294 it seems as though teachers are terribly frightened of being thought racist its almost impossible to say anything against islam in this country because if you do you are accused of being racist or islamophobic
822295 there are these two theories one is called evolution the other is called genesis

822310 the threat to canadian society is not a bunch of muslim boys playing paintball its an ideologically driven government willing to curtail our civil liberties
822311 now many americans believe that that new pearl harbor event took place on 9 11
822312 and according to a recent new york times and cbs news poll 84 of americans believe that there were some criminal elements of our government involved in 9 11
822313 can you tell us about your role as hold on as president of the new citizen project founded in 1994 which served as a chief fund raising and parent organization to pnac and is this one of the factors that has made you so reluctant to support the victims family members and first responders who are begging for a new investigation into 9 11
822314 and that is that it was joe lieberman and i a democrat that sponsored the legislation for the 9 11 commission and very frankly the administration was not shall i say enthusiastic about the establishment of that commission i am proud of what the 9 11 commission did i am proud that we have enacted many of the reforms that they recommended and i will stand by their recommendations and their conclusions as will the overwhelming majority of americans
822315 you are free to disagree with their conclusions but i am proud to have been one of those who was along with joe lieberman responsible for the establishment of the 9 11 commission
822316 there can be no greater offense of a commander in chief than to misrepresent a cause of war and to send our brave men and women into harms way based on those misrepresentations
822317 if the bush administration had nothing to hide why did they hide everything
822318 but there was a problem the berlin wall had come down and the soviet union had collapsed the first bush white house had to find another bad guy fast to justify the defense budget and they did saddam hussein they suckered him into attacking kuwait and the first gulf war was on
822319 as a combat veteran i will not stand idly by and watch our security destroyed by a president who went awol rather than fight in vietnam
822320 when i joined the air force i swore to uphold the constitution of the united states against all enemies foreign and domestic that includes a renegade president if they go ahead with this war i will call for the impeachment of george w bush dick cheney and the whole oil mafia this war would be treason god bless america and god save us from george w bush
822321 ive been severely criticized for speaking out in opposition to this coming war
822322 i feel an affinity for the troops deployed in kuwait
822323 the troops surrounding iraq are not protecting us we are protecting them and their honor and their freedoms by speaking truth to power
822324 a preemptive war would be immoral illegal unconstitutional a war crime against the people of iraq and treason against the united states of america
822325 trying to eliminate saddam would have incurred incalculable human and political costs we would have been forced to occupy baghdad and in effect rule iraq there was no viable exit strategy we could see had we gone the invasion route the united states could conceivably still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land

822333 declining production from a field typically means the pressure the oil is under is falling so other fluids or gas must be pumped in to force what remains out of the ground making the work harder and more expensive the decline also ultimately leads to the point when although much of its oil may remain in place oil companies turn their back on the field as it has become too expensive to justify the work
822334 the cantarell oilfield in the shallow waters of the campeche bay is regarded in the mexican oil industry as the countrys crown jewel it is the worlds second largest oil field by production pumping about 2 2 million barrels of oil as much as every oil field in kuwait put together for that reason the news from petroleos mexicanos the state oil company that the fields production would begin to decline this year was met with dismay declining production from a field typically means the pressure the oil is under is falling so other fluids or gas must be pumped in to force what remains out of the ground making the work harder and more expensive the decline also ultimately leads to the point when although much of its oil may remain in place oil companies turn their back on the field as it has become too expensive to justify the work

822366 waterboarding is a technique that simulates drowning in a controlled environment it consists of immobilizing an individual on his or her back with the head inclined downward and pouring water over the face to force the inhalation of water into the lungs waterboarding has been used to obtain information coerce confessions punish and intimidate in contrast to merely submerging the head waterboarding elicits the gag reflex and can make the subject believe death is imminent waterboardings use as a method of torture or means to support interrogation is based on its ability to cause extreme mental distress although waterboarding in cases can leave no lasting physical damage it carries the real risks of extreme pain damage to the lungs brain damage caused by oxygen deprivation injuries as a result of struggling against restraints including broken bones and even death

822372 it is not working out anymore it is training it is training to go win a game working out is something you do when you try to keep your body in okay shape but training is for something greater which is winning a game on saturday
822373 turn the program around thats why i came here in the first place to actually be a part of that would be a great opportunity for me and something i could carry throughout my life knowing i helped turn duke football around
822374 getting that game experience helps you out a lot because you are facing pretty much the same people year end and year out
822375 the game becomes slower you kind of get the gist of what people are going to do and you kind of get an edge because you have faced them a couple of times

822381 i want my relatives to come to my house for this holiday but im going to do things my way and lets just hope everyone enjoys it
822382 through familial obligation and their spirit of generosity ive managed to trap my family into spending the holiday with me at my house
822383 i feel like a loser this is my one chance each year to impress my friends and relatives and if i succeed i can finally be impressed with myself
822384 you know i just dont get the holidays i mean whats to celebrate there are people suffering everywhere its all to make money anyway its just so phoney
822385 spawning misery makes me feel alive youre too happy today we need to fix that
822386 thats the gift you got for so and so i really dont think that was a wise choice
822387 gosh i hate christmas i dont know why i just do do we have to have it
822388 you know this might be the last year im around for this holiday

822402 i cant care about what our government does all over the world i have to trust that they know what theyre doing
822403 the first overarching big problem is to make the good person we must have better human beings or else it is quite possible that we may all be wiped out and even if not wiped out certainly live in tension and anxiety as a a species
822404 rising gas prices have been particularly troublesome for drivers whove grown accustomed to the raised seating position and added interior flexibility of suvs
822405 with the ford escape hybrid those so inclined can have their cake and haul it too
822406 we also considered factors like comfort performance utility and technology
822407 we wanted to put together a fairly wide ranging list that would suit the needs of a cross section of the american public
822408 it combines the fuel economy and emissions benefits of a full hybrid with the capability toughness and spaciousness of the ford escape
822409 customers can do a lot more with this vehicle than with other car based hybrid vehicles
822410 a lot of crossovers are designed with a very fast rear end meaning a sloping rear window and that kind of styling affects the functionality of the vehicle
822411 the escape hybrid combines attractive styling with excellent carrying capacity
822412 the vehicle achieves up to 34 mpg in city driving and can travel more than 500 miles in city driving on a single tank of gasoline
822413 the interior features the industrys first fabric seating surfaces made from 100 percent recycled material
822414 the technology of the ford escape hybrid is certainly stellar
822415 it feels and drives like a conventional vehicle and it does all of the things a conventional ford escape can do theres no penalty at all for the hybrid operation
822416 the 2009 model is improved in every way especially from a drivability standpoint
822417 the hybrid system is better than ever with very smooth transitions between electric and gasoline power plus the braking feel is much improved

822423 charismatics are flocking to the sleepy town of lakeland fla to attend evangelist todd bentleys unconventional revival services
822424 his methods are far from polished when he prayed for people in lakeland he usually began by laying his hand on their heads and then yelling bam often the people fell backward to the floor after one elderly woman fell bentley told the audience she doesnt know why she fell down the woman then laughed and said to him in the microphone because you pushed me he prayed for her three more times that night and she said she could hear better during the past three weeks people have testified of being healed from heart conditions skin rashes and back problems and many said scars disappeared many charismatics are wondering if the protracted meetings will become a phenomenon similar to what happened in rodney meetings in lakeland in 1993 at the toronto airport vineyard church in canada in 1994 and at brownsville assembly of god in pensacola in 1995
822425 i decided to check out patricia king and todd bentley and ignorant of their third heaven guided visualizations attended a five day conference of patricia king and then two of todd bentleys conferences and began to imagine third heaven visitations guided visualization still not realizing that these are actually spirits of darkness the new age calls them spirit guides demons is what they are
822426 i was in my living room laying on the floor listening to the teaching on how to visualize the third heaven and what to say and was getting caught up into his teaching and all of a sudden i began to shake uncontrollably and jerk and groan and no sooner had this taken place i became frozen stiff i could not move any part of my body and i knew this was a demon trying to take hold of me and so with all the effort i could muster i cried out
822427 i spent much of the night in tears asking god to forgive me and renouncing all the hands layed on me and all the awful deception i had opened myself up to
822428 i think that the smoking industry in australia is on the down a lot of people are more health conscious now and are turning away from it
822429 we have just finished the arrangements with implementing the indoor smoking ban this was the biggest reform to smoking laws in about a decade at this stage were not contemplating shifting the goal post in terms of banning smoking in outdoor areas or cars well continue to monitor the laws weve introduced and reactions to them
822430 i think there is a responsibility on parents to protect their children and recognise that second hand smoke can have serious consequences for their children particularly when they are breathing it in enclosed vehicles
822431 we need to be mindful of not creating laws which we cant enforce in britain as part of their ban on indoor smoking they also tackled smoking in company cars at the end of june 2007 well look to the uk tasmania and south australia as a model to how these laws are operating and being enforced
822432 the government will continue to use graphic advertising to show the detrimental effects of smoking

822440 walking into a bar in the afternoon has never felt so inviting
822441 i think its good for non smokers but as far as gaming is concerned its negative with our revenue dropping
822442 in the first week people continued to smoke some couldnt adjust to the fact smoking indoors is no longer the norm it took about a month to set in
822443 weve had a couple of complaints but a lot more are happy weve actually lost one regular customer who was a heavy smoker coincidentally he stopped coming in for afternoon drinks when we had the reforms come in
822444 a lot of regulars boycotted the bar for a little while when the reforms came in but now its slowly picking up again
822445 i think it was good how they started it gradually its not such a drastic plan
822446 i wouldnt be able to work otherwise i only started working here the day the ban came out i hate smoking so much its definitely been a long time coming
822447 im not against it because its a serious health issue and morally excellent but its just a case of being able to manage the bar better because it has impacted on everyones business
822448 sydneys bars and clubs speak out on the indoor smoking ban
822449 the medical evidence is clear second hand smoke kills and the new indoor smoking ban will save hundreds if not thousands of lives
822450 there is a huge amount of pro tobacco material on the web which escapes regulation
822451 bahay mo may bato kung nakatira ay kwago mabuti pa ang kubo ang nakatira ay tao
822452 the implementation of the indoor smoking ban has proved extremely successful with clubs and smokers working together to ensure the health of non smokers is protected from the existence of second hand smoke while revenue is substantially down in clubs across the state the first step of compliance has been overwhelmingly achieved for clubs the challenge now is winning back those members who have decided not to visit because of the indoor smoking bans this is no easy feat and will take some time however with the large and comfortable outdoor areas clubs have built im confident smokers will return the challenge now for clubs is convincing those people who are trying clubs for the first time that theirs is a place worth returning to time and time again

822455 a lot of regular smokers wont go to non smoking nightclubs because theyll sometimes have to walk one hundred metres to get out for a cigarette then you have a constant stream coming in and out its very hard
822456 its a lot healthier here now downstairs because theres no ventilation and no windows just the air conditioning vent so when we used to work down there it was really gross
822457 a lot of people have been smoking outside the pub on the footpaths and doorways particularly weeknights because thats the only place weve got
822458 i release memories that allowed belief in war and strife i let peaceful angels clear misconceptions and distortions from my path

822468 and i wonder why cant humans just strive to be good people without adding a religious label
822469 when im good im very good but when im bad im better

822535 in the month of june there were 28 american fatalities in afghanistan just one less than died in iraq last month
822536 violence in afghanistan has increased markedly over recent weeks with june the deadliest month for u s troops since the war began in 2001

822566 statewide home sales remained above the 400 000 level for the second month in a row and up nearly 18 percent from a year ago
822567 following a 30 month string of year to year percentage decreases that began in october 2005 sales last month also posted their third consecutive year to year gain
822568 sales were driven in part by large shares of deeply discounted distressed sales in many parts of the state
822569 with lower prices and favorable interest rates affordability also has improved significantly in recent months paving the way for many buyers to purchase their first home
822570 the significant declines in the median price over the past several months are largely due to a dramatic shift in the sales mix since the onset of the credit crunch and the increase in the share of distressed sales
822571 a year ago the under 500 000 price range accounted for 40 percent of sales the middle segment made up about 45 percent and the over 1 million segment captured 15 percent of the market as of june 2008 the shares had shifted to 67 percent 24 percent and 9 percent respectively

822584 we were able to image dark energy in action as it stretches huge supervoids and superclusters of galaxies
822585 when a microwave enters a supercluster it gains some gravitational energy and therefore vibrates slightly faster
822586 later as it leaves the supercluster it should lose exactly the same amount of energy but if dark energy causes the universe to stretch out at a faster rate the supercluster flattens out in the half billion years it takes the microwave to cross it thus the wave gets to keep some of the energy it gained as it entered the supercluster
822587 dark energy sort of gives microwaves a memory of where theyve been recently
822588 with this method for the first time we can actually see what supervoids and superclusters do to microwaves passing through them

822650 obama insists on disregarding the us official blind spot that has continued to destabilise the middle east for generations if he is indeed interested in straightening the distorted course of his countrys foreign policy in the region then he is certainly viewing it from an israeli looking glass the same as used by the bush neo conservative clique which led america into an unrivalled downfall in mesopotamia
822651 israelis see bush as having been better to israel than almost any president before has been
822652 that the democratic party is not a welcome place for joe lieberman
822653 obama is likely to return us to role of honest broker mccain sees fighting islamic extremists as paramount
822654 solo a fare il nome di quell uomo si pu morire
822655 first id like to take a moment to send our thoughts and prayers to coach stallings and his family anybody who has ever met john mark and i did one time knew that he was definitely full of sunshine
822656 to give you a brief synopsis real quick of kind of where we are at we talk about process here a lot
822657 weve got a lot of guys out there who are very athletic weve got a lot of guys that have potential to fit into the pieces of the puzzle but weve got a lot of practicing to do and obviously some scrimmages when we get to that test so anything above that will really be putting the cart before the horse
822658 the thing thats good about it is that kirby smart and i had actually worked together before coach saban and kirby were together we were together at florida state he was a graduate assistant for us at florida state so weve been friends for a long time so in terms of just trying to make it happen and fitting everything together where people have a chance to be recognized for being a strong part of the staff which coach saban is very good about that there has not been anything at all we keep on keeping on theres enough work around here ill promise you that if youve got anybody who else wants to come along and get a title well give them a title and put them to work because theres plenty to do
822659 thats putting the cart before the horse too ive been there done that if an opportunity arises and you have to look at each and every situation differently ill promise you this if the opportunity occurs then well access the situation to see the commitment of the program see if they want to win and if it doesnt well keep doing what were doing and be happy along the way
822660 i think just as you talk about players and them being in the second year of the process the older guys it makes it just more adaptable you kind of know what the other is thinking before you get to the problem you can anticipate problems and have them solved in advance and i dont think its any different for a staff anytime you get going and just kind of have a feel i know my 20th year of marriage is a lot different than my first year of marriage was
822661 every one of them is different in their own way the first thing about rolando is that he plays very very very intelligent i mean in an extreme way both across campus in a classroom its reflected in how he goes about that and also on the football field he just understands the game almost from a coachs eyes then you put on top of that he has an unbelievable amount of ability and hes big and strong so that can be a lethal combination
822662 were only about 48 hours into it so theres a lot that remains to be seen but obviously we do have a comprehensive playbook but its not hard in terms of theres a lot of little components in it but once you learn the concepts it all kind of fits together so i think that process is still ongoing i do know this as a coach you always want to have something to do and you always want to have some way of trying to help somebody be better i told one of the freshmen the other day look if you do it all in one try id be out of work so right now ive still got a job
822663 rolando is a very confident young man and like i said hes very intelligent he understands the defense he understands all the little nuances and hes kind of a positive upbeat guy who is kind of outgoing and likes to help people he just doesnt go about his daily work quietly hes always got something going on and hes kind of applied that to help those younger guys its just his personality hes got the personality to do that ive been around some who were just as smart and just as talented but personality wise they just were not very outgoing so they didnt become coaches on the field rolando is certainly a coach on the field
822664 i think the first thing id like to do is give our condolences as an organization and as a group and as a family to coach gene stallings and his family for their loss
822665 from a football standpoint we are very pleased with the two days we have been able to accomplish in camp so far just in helmets
822666 we dont have any significant injuries to report wide receiver darius hanks is in a black shirt because he had a shoulder injury in the spring he had surgery right after spring practice and at least the first week he is cleared to practice no one had any contact but he would not have had contact if we were in shoulder pads shells or whatever we will go in shoulder pads and shells today the focus of what we try to do in terms of installation will not change so we will continue to work and try to improve there is a lot to learn there is a lot of teaching going on and i think the players attitude toward it has been excellent and the coaches are doing a great job
822667 well first of all we always ask the player what they want to play a lot of players have specific wants and needs about what theyd like to try and be what their goals and aspirations are and what they have the passion to play i think thats important that you give them an opportunity to play that i also think there is a part of a business decision that goes into every guys future as to where he can contribute to the team best and where he can best develop his career as a football player i think at some point and time you sit down and talk to a player about that if its necessary thats basically how we do it we have a pretty good idea in recruiting most guys will indicate to you ill do whatever you want me to do to help the team some guys say that want to play a certain position and you make a commitment to allowing them to do that as a rule of thumb if it doesnt matter and the guys has the ability to play both sides of the ball my rule of thumb is id rather start front seven players on defense if they have an opportunity to do that and move them to offense later and skill guys start them all on offense and move them to defense later if that makes any sense
822668 alfred has done a really good job he did an outstanding job in the spring and he continues to work on developing as a football player we have been pleased with his progress he is out there competing and has an opportunity to contribute in the front seven he had a good spring and he improved in the spring and that has put him in position to have an opportunity to help the team but what he does now is going to be the most important thing in terms of how he contributes to the team this year
822669 jim has a very good background in terms of knowledge and experience and the people he has been with thats always something we take into consideration when we hire anyone he did a fantastic job as fresno state fresno state head coach pat hill and i used to coach together with the cleveland browns so we have a pretty good relationship sometimes those kinds of guys that you have relationships with that you coached with before are the guys that you get the kind of recommendation from that you have faith trust and confidence in i think jim has done a fantastic job since he has been here he has an excellent personality the players like him i think we have more diversity on what we do offensively without changing the whole ball of wax to make it difficult for the players his positive energy and enthusiasm as been a real asset to the organization as well as his knowledge and experience i think is going to be helpful in not only utilizing our personnel but in how we plan and prepare for games
822670 i think we have a really good defensive staff i dont think any of the changes that we made are affecting anything that we do the implementation of what we do is similar so everybody accepted those roles being team players so that we could keep the best possible coaching staff here we certainly appreciate that we have some outstanding coaches kevin steele is an outstanding coach as good a coach as ive ever been around he is probably as ready to be a head coach anyway in the country that anybody weve ever had because is mature he has been a head coach before he does a great job not only as a football coach but in the overall administration of what any program needs to do to be successful kirby has been with us and knows the system and adds a lot of experience to that he is mature enough at this point in his career to take on a little more responsibility those two guys work extremely well together
822671 john parker is doing really well he had an excellent spring i think that having a good bowl game last year probably helped his confidence certainly he did a great job in the off season he and coach mac offensive coordinator jim mcilwain seemed to have worked well together i think technically he has improved and i think his decision making and his judgment have improved hopefully we can continue to make the big plays and minimize that not so good plays that we have especially when turning the ball over which still is one of the most critical statistics to winning of any he seemed to be a little more business like in his approach he is a great competitor and very emotional guy and sometimes playing quarterback you want a guy to make business decisions and not get caught up emotionally in trying to hard and forcing things he seems to have developed a real maturity in that area which i think could affect his play in a positive way
822672 first of all and i havent had a chance to meet very many of you but i want to express my gratitude to the people of tuscaloosa and the people of the alabama football family and the community around for making our first time here and the things weve done as a family feel welcome into the deep south
822673 that being said i know there are a ton of questions
822674 in his case im his third voice ive been in this situation before that is a hard thing for the quarterback because even though changes arent big nuances are and in this offense weve been very fortunate in the past to put up some decent numbers and do some decent things but at the end of the day its all about wins and losses and we cant lose sight of that fact if we have five yards of offense and win the game 3 0 its the greatest game in the history of football because we won and thats what the bottom line is trying to win the football game im not caught up in a lot of the stats im not a stats guy never will be a stats guy stats will fall where they do the key is to figure out a way offensively to combine your defense your special teams and your offense into one unit to win the ball game thats what the bottom line is we have a luxury here of obviously having a great defensive staff to say was i tested this spring by those guys this guys advanced over there on defense im telling you there are some really good things that those guys do and that only helps you as a ball squad those are things that i wanted to get out there on the table as far as jp and the development of the other quarterbacks that we have i feel were going to be able to have a little bit of depth there too early to tell was i happy with the 15 days of spring practice absolutely not plain and simple although there have been games and you could probably ask the people in the past that weve been very successful with and scored some points and ran a team out of the building and i wasnt happy with that either so i guess where my mind set is that it is our responsibility to make sure that we are efficient in what we do get the ball out of our hands get rid of any turnovers and we put the ball in the end zone and the red zone is that going to happen time will tell im not necessarily looking forward to the clemson game or whatever game right now were actually looking forward to todays practice looking forward to trying to win every play every drill we do and then well work on that as we go we cant look down the pipe right now weve got too much work to do in every individual drill
822675 there have been some eye opening experiences this thing they call humidity its something thats awful new you kind of enjoy yourself so when you do get some time to be able to go out and sit on your back patio and sometimes you cant because youre dripping with sweat but i tell you what the great part i will say this and this is not by any ways to say anything about anywhere else but this deal they call southern hospitality im speaking for my family im speaking for myself it is a term that is used in other parts of the country but until you experience it it is a great thing the people are fantastic when we talk about southern hospitality i cant say anything better
822676 from a background standpoint there are a couple of things that means
822677 the first time coach saban called i had no idea that there was anything happening here believe it or not out in california the tuscaloosa news doesnt arrive on the front porch so i wasnt quite aware of what was going on when coach saban first called i hung up because i thought it was one of my buddies messing with me but did it didnt come as a total surprise absolutely i think he and coach hill had maybe talked but he coach hill hadnt mentioned anything at first thats how it went how he dug up this name i dont know but you know what im glad he did
822678 yes i think one of the things is part of the background of where weve grown up and the systems weve been in but number one is to be physical and make sure that the team that youre playing knows that they better bring their lunch because were going to come after you on every play so i guess also an idea of developing that look when we hit the field were here and youre in for a long day thats number one number two is guys in a game of football and a game of life there are ebbs and flows what we try to do is preach the fact that weve got to stay on a level surface we cant get down we cant get up what we have to do is do this and we try to preach a win this play philosophy and what i mean by that is in the game of football if youre lucky you get 65 70 offensive plays thats 70 individual events that occur in the game the key is to win the majority of hose individual events now you have a chance to be successful and win the ball game so the idea of ripping off the rear view mirror of what happened on the last play and not letting it affect your play because youve got to go out and win the next play those are the things that i try to preach
822679 there are guys who have individual skills that some do some things better than others it is still in progress those 15 amazing in the pro game youve got all these open days youre with these guys all the time so you are able to kind of develop a little more personality of who these guys are and what they can do so this is really an important training camp because its an evolution of the 15 days we had and have those guys all come out im not going to put a name on anybody because its still a discovery stage the thing weve got to do right now is make sure conceptually everybody understands their role everybody understands what were trying to accomplish and at that time its amazing how playmakers kind of emerge
822680 walks at the wrong time errors a lot of errors both mental errors and physical errors
822681 and most of the time the other team is scoring first
822682 so many times the other teams goes through its batting order twice before we go through once that equals their big boys coming to the plate five times instead of four times
822683 i dont want to run him out there for only four innings on his first start and put my bullpen in jeopardy
822684 we want him to at least go seven innings or 100 pitches more than likely hell pitch two there
822685 he threw off the mound and threw pretty good and well find out whats what when we get home
822686 i was throwing the ball all right but nothing went right but it definitely doesnt help when you walk the leadoff guy
822687 other than i knew i had been throwing the ball well and getting people out i didnt know how many innings and it wasnt a very good way to end it
822688 why are you calling me this early in the morning with such a question
822689 last night i had a dream in that dream i saw you smiling surrounded by a sort of spiritual light called noor in islam then i heard a strong and powerful voice saying allah has made this man a muslim in the night and allah has given him the name bilal abdul alim 3 times so your job is to call him in the morning and invite him to accept islam and give him his new name
822690 the first thing in religion is to be aware of it
822691 do not be like those who forget allah and so he caused them to forget themselves such are really the wicked
822692 the most useful of all knowledge is the knowledge of oneself
822693 i wonder how a man who looks for the things lost by him does not look for himself
822694 the western man can accomplish great feats which according to other nations can be accomplished only by god but he cannot do one thing he cannot look into his inner self this fact alone is enough to prove the worthlessness of the false glitter of modern culture
822695 if western culture has led the europeans to indulging in wine and sex it is because they are bent upon forgetting and wasting their self instead of seeking it most of their great and heroic achievements and even their good deeds are the outcome of their forgetting themselves the practical ability of the western man to make discoveries inventions and provision of war equipment originates from his escape from self and not from his extraordinary self control if man loses his soul what is the use of his conquering the world
822696 there exists only one truth in the world and that is the knowledge of self he who knows himself knows god and all others he who does not know himself does not know anything in this world there exist one force one freedom and one justice and that force is that of ruling over oneself in this world there exists only one virtue and that is the virtue of liking others as much as one likes oneself in other words we should look upon others as we look upon ourselves all other questions are imaginary and non existing
822697 am i or am i not if i am who am i
822698 may allah bless the man who knows wherefrom he has come where he is and where he will go
822699 all men are like the organs of one body a man who has no sympathy with others does not deserve to be called a human being
822700 man does not belong to one single species but is a multi species being in fact an individual may one day belong to one species and another day to a different species
822701 the faithful are the organs of one body when one organ is afflicted with pain fever or sleeplessness other organs automatically sympathize with it
822702 i like him to live although he likes me to be killed
822703 when truth assumes a fixed shape because of determining facts in words it is expressed as i and you but in reality i and you are mere manifestations of one real existence bodies and souls are the reflections of the same light which sometimes appears in a lamp and sometimes in a mirror
822704 you think that the word i always refers to the soul you do not know what is self because you follow reason i and you are above body and soul for both of them are a part of the ego i does not refer to any particular person so that it might refer to his soul try to be above all creation renounce the world and you will automatically become the world yourself
822705 allah has not put two hearts into the bosom of any man
822706 i am happy with the world because this thriving world is his and i love the whole world because the whole world is his
822707 prophet muhammad of arabia ascended the highest heaven and returned i swear by allah that if i had reached that point i should never have returned
822708 there has come to you a messenger from among yourselves to whom your misfortune is too hard to bear and who is eager to see that you prosper
822709 yet you will possibly destroy yourself with grief feeling sorry for them if they do not believe in this statement the quran
822710 what a bad idea it would be that i should ever be overwhelmed by my evil desires and should be led by my greed to choose tasty dishes while there may be in hijaz or yamamah somebody who has no hope of getting coarse bread and who has never eaten to his fill is it reasonable that i should sleep satiated while there are empty bellies and burning hearts around me
822711 i saw a lion shooting this statement is actually composed of the two following statements
822712 notice for recovery of tax under section 76 1 of the inland revenue ordinance
822713 you will ride life straight to perfect laughter its the only good fight there is

822718 translation people using computers at the barack obama campaign are using them to systematically hack attack and shut down websites that dont agree with him
822719 did the spam messages that shut down dbkp blogger originate from the same ips that shut down macsmind
822720 if google finds the attacks came from the ips at barrackobama com will they let anyone know
822721 yesterday former howard government immigration minister kevin andrews said he did not receive any advice from asio about dr haneef
822722 and follow not that of which thou hast no knowledge surely the hearing and sight and the heart all of
822723 and if thou obey most of the inhabitants of the earth they will mislead thee far from the way of god they follow naught but an opinion and they do but guess
822724 god does not impose on a soul a duty but to the extent of its ability
822725 im very sorry for this mistake you see i pulled up behind your car while you were blowing your horn flipping the guy off in front of you and cussing a blue streak at him
822726 for the son of god became man so that we might become god
822727 for this is why the word became man and the son of god became the son of man so that man by entering into communion with the word and thus receiving divine sonship might become a son of god
822728 for the son of god became man so that we might become god
822729 the only begotten son of god wanting to make us sharers in his divinity assumed our nature so that he made man might make men gods
822730 it is easy for believers especially in the western world where the church is generally prosperous and respected to be complacent and become oblivious to the seriousness of the battle around them
822731 one of the most important discoveries i have ever made is this truth god is most glorified in me when i am most satisfied in him
822732 it is easy for believers especially in the western world where the church is generally prosperous and respected to be complacent and become oblivious to the seriousness of the battle around them

822734 the pit and the pendulum the effect of isochronism on the oscillation of a small angle pendulum

822764 if you get over here of course thats a promise i will introduce you as a friend though
822765 i thought that would be the plan in the first place i wouldnt think youd like to introduce me as your girlfriend due to the crazy johnny rules i have on question though
822766 did you actually date inoue mao you see theres a forum that i entered thats only about you and her its really neat and i really believe you guys did
822767 maybe i shouldnt ask that question i was curious im sorry
822768 i think its my fault she and i didnt get along in the beginning yet i thought mao was very pretty and intelligent it was kind of lonely at first but we started opening up more i love it when a girl is independent being the straightforward person that i am i asked her out first i thought it was a stupid move but she accepted we werent boyfriend and girlfriend just more dating after everything ended for season 2 it was well we just became really busy she had her career a head of her and i wasnt going to ruin it because i am a johnny so we mutually broke it off but became really close friends i see her more as a little sister now and we call each other up to hang out i will say she was a great kisser though
822769 i will say that im glad you both are close friends and the kissing part was unnecessary
822770 ah that must have been a hard decision though i know you worked with her but you guys really looked like you were in love when i watched season 2 especially the ending it was so real
822771 on my end yes with mao she kind of did but things may have been bad in the future if we stayed together further
822772 goodness if i ever talk johnny i want to lay it out that it can be just too much you cant even fall in love
822773 you know you would be the first to stand up to johnny no one outside of the business ever does
822774 i figured because theyd get sued or something horrible will just happen still i believe its too much
822775 after working here almost 10 years its second nature he gives me a lot of time to reflect and do what i want i feel like were the only group that he does this to actually

822787 be careful though james may sue him for something if he finds out
822788 seriously if he wasnt a prosecutor it may be different also the person im seeing is in japan james isnt an international prosecutor
822789 hes not my boyfriend were just dating you know seeing how things go
822790 it seems more than that you talk to him like youre in love man im curious who this guy really is cause he doesnt sound like an average guy
822791 ok ok yet i have a personal question ive always wanted to ask you
822792 if you want me to go into details about everything then take me out to dinner
822793 that works then it does explain why you can be really uptight
822794 lets just get back to work i want to get this done before we get more cases from the director
822795 jun could you give me a minute theres some weird man at my door
822796 are you going to hug me or are we going to stare at each other for the next couple of hours
822797 i wasnt going to miss your birthday so im here till sunday
822798 sometimes i think youre makino instead of mao its strange but i had to
822799 i see you on magazines so its hard to not stop thinking about you
822800 i had to have the cab driver look up the address for me
822801 no i was going to have dinner and probably catch a movie
822802 yes its obvious i know look lets go out to dinner and probably come back here for a movie i think im still in shock
822803 lets get these roses in a vase first before we go
822804 well most of them are not going to have japanese subtitles
822805 its my birthday i might as well look good out today out of other days
822806 i was waiting for you to kick my ass what happened to that
822807 you want me to i have no issues if you want to provoke it further
822808 good lets get dinner were gonna avoid any japanese restaurants because i can see all the girls wanting pictures and grabbing you
822809 id take you to the top but its open meaning rain will wet us
822810 if youre used the city life well japan is more like this in tokyo
822811 we should come up here tomorrow during the day to go to the other sights
822812 that sounds really good actually i didnt have anything planned are you sure youre not going to get bombarded by fans though its a bit risky
822813 gomen gomen i didnt think a comment like that would make you twitch
822814 how about we just take in the sights more for about 10 minutes
822815 jun i dont want to go farther were still getting to know each other even though it feels like its been years
822816 like ill leave you after this or something even worse
822817 i am scared the truth is that im still a virgin so this is all new to me
822818 it doesnt mean that ive never made out or messed around with people
822819 gomen im not going to lie to you because it would be a lie if i said i didnt want you its just that ive never felt this way about anyone i know weve been dating already about more than 6 months this should be comfortable but it isnt since weve got a long distance relationship
822820 i believe theres something more to our relationship im not going to force you to do anything k
822821 lets go to bed its been a long day for both of us well im probably going to sleep out here actually
822822 well i bet you dont want me to sleep on your bed with you
822823 stop assuming i want you to even though i dont want sex right now
822824 tell me its not the anan of me being naked
822825 for divers unknown reasons i beseech you grant me this boon
822826 china is neither a colonial or imperial power in the sense the portuguese spanish dutch british japanese and russians were or the americans are
822827 it has dented my reputation quite seriously people take me at my word so i expect the information i am giving to be consistent
822828 i can solve cases like that but this one is just not one of them
822829 cheer up you cant get it all perfect at once
822830 the person were looking for is completely throwing us off and is not part of law enforcement
822831 you need to just rest its not the end of the world
822832 i know but id like to get this done not for me for mao
822833 you seriously like her that much i say you two go out on a date
822834 you kissed her she kissed back you admitted to each other how you both felt
822835 are you sure you dont want me to set you up with someone
822836 oh shut up jun you know no girl will date me
822837 ever think that females ever found you attractive but you are so caught up in your work to be that oblivious
822838 besides the girl id like to date has to meet up to some standards
822839 you make them high cause i know you that well
822840 ill tell you after this case is over id like to not talk about it
822841 well i see you already have some ideas do you wonder if its anyone we particularly know
822842 im still wondering about my new partner that chief assigned me with hes very well mysterious hes straight to the point as well but he seems to like mao
822843 hes from another precinct hes actually like you cracked cases like that
822844 yeah apparently he still goes to college and its at maos university
822845 i know i think thats the reason why they wanted yamapi to come here for this case the chief assumed you can work better if someone else is watching mao while you research the clues further
822846 well its up to you what you want to do i just decided to come and help out from the stories the chief told me plus its been getting a bit dead in my area so this would boost up more work for me
822847 sure you sure youre not looking at porn while being on the computer
822848 and try to get caught by the station no thanks thats what my home computer was for
822849 im actually in the mood to go to the bar for a bit
822850 sure im up for anything lets try not to get too drunk though
822851 i saw a video with you in it i need to ask you some questions
822852 on the news a week ago i was up late and you were standing near a female i need to know if you know her
822853 thats you shun its not photo shopped in you already look suspicious
822854 then how come you dont looked phased in the background all the police officers were panicking and you just stood there
822855 are you in on this whole fiasco just tell me the truth
822856 if i was i would not be speaking about it to the police besides the bomb threat wasnt bad ive seen worse remember
822857 i was put on this case without a choice im doing all that i can to help seriously i just want to know for the record
822858 jun i dont know her and this since i was trained to stay calm in situations like this i dont panic i simply analyze the situation
822859 i would ask chief for a vacation for the next couple of days you normally question people very carefully but right now you seem like youre snapping which only happens when you havent solved a case
822860 i dont know man the pressure is on and the perpetrator is still out there he or she is scaring mao and even going after me
822861 come on at least take mao out for a weekend or something get your mind off this for just a little bit
822862 from the way you just questioned me yes im going to get back to work k
822863 jun shota explained to me what happened youre going against protocol you know you need to clear who you question by me first
822864 the point is that hes next to a woman who looks familiar and hes also not fazed they must know each other
822865 i dont know exactly what is going through your mind but you need a break this is not enough to support for questioning shun
822866 i didnt photoshop this in sir i watched this video over and over again to see what i missed then i finally saw it
822867 still without further proof we have no room for questioning even our own colleague you are dismissed for the week and this will come out of your vacation time
822868 ask the chief im out of the case for a week
822869 no i get a free week off because im not performing my duties well
822870 you get a break and get paid i dont see any issues there
822871 i do ive been working on this case for the past few weeks and havent found the person behind all this
822872 arent there some cases where it takes months or even years
822873 maybe your brain if you continue to drown your sorrows in drinking and smoking
822874 once in a while i actually heard you were dismissed for the week
822875 no why would i im going to have to do some work while im on this dismissal
822876 i dont think that would be wise of you to do
822877 put it this way after you questioned shun today the chief called us all in to keep an eye out for you if youre working on this case in anyway like accessing our databases hell suspend you for 3 months
822878 look he put yamapi in charge for the week so lets say youll see him more than you want to
822879 something isnt right chief wouldnt just do this out of nowhere unless
822880 i dont know much except i got to watch you here and there maybe youve already stumbled upon something and are really oblivious
822881 or you are over analyzing something you dont need to ive seen you work and that can happen still this case doesnt make sense to me i read the file that the chief showed us and there are so many things still missing
822882 maybe this all started off as revenge against maos parents now this person is not only targeting mao but you too the way i figured is that only you know all the answers and have to piece them together
822883 a lot of whats happened has been very meticulous i know this is stereotypical but women hide very well their actions feelings etc putting it into context of whats happening it makes sense
822884 i never thought it could be a female she would have to be connected to the law enforcement somehow because no one could know my number i personally dont know any female who could make a bomb or know a lot of about computers
822885 dont question me like that she was strangled and stabbed there was blood everywhere dont tell me that was a false scene
822886 for the artist you pick up things clearly i will not think that shes alive when shes dead i was at the funeral took therapy sessions and trained to be a detective after her death

822943 thorns from growing among the good plants and poison from mixing with medicine
822944 when you look at that half century old sycamore tree tell me what you see
822945 i remember planting that tree shortly after we built this house it was spring and a neighbor down the road was clearing a place on his property for an additional barn that tree was to be taken out and since our yard had so few trees then his wife asked if i wanted it it was a sapling not quite a year old and so it was easily moved she brought it to me late one may afternoon in a wheelbarrow she even insisted on helping me plant it
822946 why child the goddess look around you she is everywhere but for me her greatness her changefulness her mysteries her wisdom can be seen and learned in a tree
822947 watch carefully as spring turns to summer watch as this tree grows through the summer and then readies itself in autumn for the long winter ahead watch with not only your eyes but look with your heart see the wisdom of nature with your soul
822948 at first i only saw a tree but with time and openness to something of which i could not then identify i began to see more i saw balance in the seasons which the tree weathered so well i saw strength and yet flexibility to be able to survive the storms i saw birth death and renewal as the seasons changed and i noted how gracefully my goddess changed with them as though she were one with them she was one with her earth she was at peace with herself visitors often remarked what a magnificent tree it has become i noted how my goddess provided shade for me and a home for birds and squirrels without losing any part of herself this was a lesson that was difficult for me in giving to others i always seemed to lose myself but watching the birds and squirrels live in her branches knowing she provided air for me to breathe and still she did not become only a home for her residents or a bearer of air for me she was still herself always a tree she did not lose herself in her duties and obligations they were a part of here but she did not become them i watched her grow from a sapling not much taller than myself to a tree that towered above my two story home she grew steadily weathering the storms rain snow heat children climbing rambunctiously among her branches family barbeques and picnics in her shade fireflies lighting her dark form more beautifully than any crystal chandelier and somehow i grew with her i became more aware of the seasons of the year and the seasons of my life i learned what was truly important and what would pass i learned that to grow we must be willing to change to give to let go and to not lose ourselves in our giving i see the goddess in all of nature but because of this first lesson i see her in a tree in a unique way all that i need to do to see my goddess is to walk outside and look there she stands roots steadfast in the earth branches reaching skyward for the moon ever changing and yet ever the same
822949 those lessons are the ones i want to share with you they have enhanced my life my relationship with the goddess as well as with all of the people in my life but you in your heart must want to learn these lessons it is not enough for me to tell you and you simply acknowledge and repeat them they are lessons that must be lived to be truly known for these lessons to imbue you with wisdom they must become a part of you do you think you are ready
822950 now child pose your question of readiness to the goddess ask with you heart and then listen with your soul she shall answer you
822951 but how will i know she is speaking to me
822952 when the goddess speaks you will not be able to ignore her her voice will be unmistakable unforgettable trust me and ask
822953 how did you know that she answered me and what that answer was

822955 i think there was some concern that part of the project was a rental project
822956 lets gather information and lets take a really good look at this and see if its a real problem or is it isolated everybody agreed that was the route to take
822957 i think trying to get more statistical information is probably a wise thing to do
822958 this committee is working because of concerns if they dont have any qualifying information to support that i think its more difficult to write a meaningful law

822967 once people do it they get hooked and do it again

822969 its also seed money for innovative research it funds not yet proven research but it could be the next cancer cure

822983 well lets have at it just dont try to tell me mine signifies anything but sex or at a stretch bam the ability to piss standing up
822984 but when you call this sexual you can only be talking about the sexual pleasure of men
822985 boys just like looking at girls its natural boys are highly sexed
822986 youre still equating gender with sex as a direct correlation theres a large body of opinion that humans just arent that simple sex is biology gender is sociology one is far more malleable than the other

822992 i do believe fdbs arguments got better after he got pissed
822993 yes its a crappy cosmetic surgery industry site but finding any credible research on the topic is very difficult
822994 your comments are plainly reasonable so the relatively small points of dissent appear proportionately larger
822995 it might be helpful to consider these distinctions in terms of primary sex characteristics those things directly connected with reproduction namely vaginas uteruses ovaries penises and testicles and secondary sex characteristics namely breasts body hair and its distribution voice pitch and so on
822996 okay breasts are just about sex so what why is it that mine need be perfectly formed 19 years old and of a certain heft in order to get respect or regard outside the bedroom when the 50 of blokes with an under average sized or misshapen cock can get away with it

823058 there was no damage to any property one man was taken to darlington memorial hospital with a suspected broken finger
823059 we were not anticipating any bother it looks like the trouble stemmed from the fact that it was a meeting between a scottish and english side people can get very passionate when that is the case
823060 the entire incident was captured on cctv so we will be viewing the footage
823061 by the time we were alerted it looked like it had been going on for a few minutes but it was over fairly quickly because of the rapid police response it was probably all over after about five minutes
823062 no officers were injured and the police dog was not needed

823069 im getting a little tired of some of these performances weve got to do better they players feeling the heat can get mad at me til the cows come home but ive got people on my tail
823070 if i were my boss id be ticked off that can be a trickle down effect if i have to tell people im taking you out of the rotation thats what ill do
823071 i wont hesitate to do anything were pretty fair here id like to think but theres a difference between effort and production
823072 hustle should never be in question running a ball out running hard is a no brainer
823073 but weve had some performances that have been terrible ive been disgusted the last few nights the last few weeks we had situations where we should have dominated a game and we didnt come close

823076 i have until march 2 to pay the 100 fine and i am not paying it its the principle it would mean you couldnt walk around with a surfboard with a logo on it
823077 so in 1988 i set up a business that sells the recorded messages you listen to when on hold on the phone apart from one year revenue has grown every year revenue is 13 million we have 11000 sites around asia pacific and clients in 18 countries
823078 we are successful because of our marketing and selling people have to be pushed into buying our product ads in newspapers and on radio absolutely do not work how i would love a business where people come to us
823079 instead we market and sell aggressively we do it in lots of ways we get leads from all sorts of people including phone sellers we have a whole group of telemarketers who cold call and if interest is expressed we have direct sales staff who follow up on interested prospects
823080 so why do they buy the product doesnt matter it never matters my products are as good as anyone elses but you have to make it different not better but different
823081 give the customer a lot of choice listen to what they want and then tailor something for them impress them and send them lots of stuff out for free
823082 after a while people say ok well buy from you there is a guy who gives me good property advice so i am always looking for ways to spend money with him
823083 clients are with us about nine years so even if we spend a years worth of revenue to get them its worth it
823084 even that is not enough so you have to come up with really aggressive stuff its bloody hard doing ambush marketing and half the time you come out of it with nothing
823085 but other times you can get a minute of great publicity
823086 most people have no idea thats possible and they have no idea how to do it they stick an ad in the paper and think thats it but you have to always be in front of them always doing a campaign so they say we just saw you last week didnt we
823087 every now and again i think about selling but it lasts about a day recently lachlan murdoch came and looked at the business but i like running the business myself
823088 the competition is savage it might get down to 100 or 110 basis points 1 to 1 1

823115 we have all our industrial relations advocates around the country and big slabs of two law firms working on it as well as two teams of consultants working on labour market modelling and extensive consulting with our members so its just extraordinary
823116 its a very difficult balancing act weve got to work through
823117 there are so many different terms and conditions 40 hour week in some states and not others some have casual loading there are different penalty rates and they all have their own balance but the battle is to make sure that is preserved
823118 since de regulating trading hours and internationalising product supply the retail market has changed and now consumers drive the market a modern retail award must reflect the modern retail market which requires flexibility and the current award is structured around fixed trading conditions
823119 the aras recommendations recognise full time employees supporting the continuation of penalty rates within the context of a seven day 24 hour trade period
823120 consumers drive labour rates within retailing and it is imperative retailers have the flexibility required to meet modern consumer demand however the ara does not support rogue retailers who dont respect their staff or their compliance requirements and our submission maintains adequate protection for employees within the modern retail award

823134 with the attainment of the required delegates to claim the democratic partys nomination for u s president sen barack h obama d il has written a new page in american history
823135 for by so doing he succeeds where channing phillips shirley chisholm jesse jackson sr and al sharpton could not by gaining the necessary delegates to demand nomination
823136 of course there have been numerous black candidates for president but these have been third party efforts designed more to raise issues to organize or protest than to actually win elections
823137 but this is a different kettle of fish for obamas candidacy is the closest to make it to the winners circle
823138 what also distinguishes obama from his predecessors is he doesnt come from civil rights black liberation socialist or anti war movements
823139 im not against all wars im just against dumb wars
823140 indeed although his detractors may try to paint him as a leftist liberal this is hardly true
823141 he has studiously avoided the very real and long standing grievances of black america
823142 this primary wounded obama and as he won in the delegate count he also lost a number of primary states such as ohio and pennsylvania which are necessary for a win in november
823143 politics is the art of making people believe that they are in power when in fact they have none
823144 it is a measure of how dire is the hour that theyve passed the keys to the kingdom to a black man
823145 as in many american cities black mayors were let in when the treasuries were almost barren and tax bases were almost at rock bottom
823146 with the nations manufacturing base also a thing of history amidst the socioeconomic wreckage of globalization with foreign affairs in shambles the rulers reach for a pretty brown face to front for the empire
823147 real change that you could believe in would be an end to empire and an end to wars for corporate greed not just a change of the shade of the political managers that change im afraid is still to come

823177 we saw similar population shifts happen in the 1990s but nothing close to this level
823178 i want security there i dont want it to become a blight
823179 its just a matter of timing its going to turn back around
823180 its not like in this downturn the place is going to hell in a handbasket thats not happening
823181 if youre an underwriter and you see someone whos listed as one of those casualties whos gotten laid off or had their salary reduced indefinitely thats going to be significant
823182 theres no such thing as a church with too much money only too little vision
823183 there never been a president to address the slaughter of young black people by this countrys police
823184 im five presidents in and i aint seen nothing happen to stop the police murders on young black people why would i believe in the system with that being said i think barack can cure that disease and help cure the country not just in that area with us blacks but also with all americans women are getting treated like dogs you know how hard it is for a woman to prove she was raped the system is warped they throw young guys whos starving in jail just trying to survive on the streets throw them in jail forever young kids 18 years old executed in texas yet child predators get to come home and do it again i think its so much our president can do obama seems like a human being i say that because a lot of presidents dont seem like human beings they seem like straight up businessmen who care about nothing but the business nah you gotta care about the people

823187 no amount of outrage and condemnation can suffice to express the anger and frustration we all feel when faced with such mindless brutality and violence
823188 i am sure you will realize that these terrorist attacks are a rapidly growing threat not just to afghanistan or india but throughout the entire saarc region
823189 i like to reiterate that bangladesh stands with resolve to deal with this issue forcefully and effectively
823190 bangladesh as a signatory to the international conventions against terrorism both globally and regionally is in the process of enacting relevant domestic laws for their effective implementation at the national level
823191 as we strive to improve the welfare of our people they continue to suffer the pain of insecurity and fear from terrorism and other transnational crimes the recent acts of terrorism in our region are a grim reminder of this menace that continues to haunt and plague our region my peaceful country too has been afflicted by this scourge and over the last few years has had to grapple with the terrorist a series of terrorist activities we unequivocally condemn these senseless and reprehensible acts of violence regardless of how sublime noble and even desperate a cause may be we can never justify the means that can kill and maim innocent men women and children in the most cowardly and barbaric ways let us renew the commitment we made in the 14th saarc summit to find the best and most practical means to implement the provisions of the existing saarc conventions on terrorism drugs trafficking in women and children and other transitional crimes
823192 terrorism continues to rear its ugly head in our region
823193 terrorists and extremists know no borders the recent attack on the indian embassy in kabul and the serial blasts in bangalore and ahmedabad in the last few days are gruesome reminders of the barbarity that still finds a place here in south asia we must act jointly and with determination to fight this scourge we must defend the values of pluralism peaceful coexistence and the rule of law
823194 saarc member states want to live together in harmony and peace i believe therefore that it is our most important duty to undertake all efforts to strength peace and stability in the region and our collective efforts to combating the scourge of terrorism
823195 the saarc convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters will complement the efforts of the law enforcement agencies for greater regional cooperation in the fight against terrorism
823196 we need to fight it individually as well as collectively
823197 i condemn the attack on the indian embassy in kabul

823200 before this i was a guy that was kind of a typical american guy that was working busy working running through a life full speed i had a little boy when we crashed that was 5 years old another one 15 had a wife who was back in the states we just got a house i had 12 nights in the house of my dreams in the states and suddenly we drop off the face of the earth when youre in our situation we realize whats important we know the three of us know better than any of you guys out there its the family and id like everyone to listen very closely to that
823201 i am uncomfortable being on the receiving end of mean and not just because sticks and stones hurt like a son of a gun my generation was a generation of eddie haskells we were taught to feign niceness even when we were ornery to the core now we seem to think nothing of confrontation it is simply a communicative tool one used to reinforce a pecking order except i personally have never felt better for having made another feel worse
823202 what could they do better sea world should involve the coaster enthusiasts to help design build and promote the next generation coaster sea world could also sponsor their site hold an event for them and figure out other ways to make them brand ambassadors

823207 the convention had many successes we had 288 participants under the age of 25 our check in registration process was one of the best ever especially in the face of record turnout we had record participation by advertisers in our program book we had a record number of exhibitors the hospitality suites on friday night enjoyed great attendance the convention also had a number of shortfalls first and foremost we made a mistake in x second when a system error caused a delay in the x we did not have a back up approach ready to turn to immediately neither of these mistakes will be made again and i can only say i am sorry for these decisions we also know that there are many other areas where we have room for improvement for example communications from the organizer to attendees were not good the lunch distribution process did not work well the organizer provided shuttle bus process produced some unfortunate upsets and off site attendee facilities were not properly secured all of these and others that will likely emerge will be corrected through our convention debrief process we know you have other comments and suggestions and we want to hear from you your input is greatly valued and your dedication to the organization is what will make x successful in 2008 please help us by sending your comments so that we can make future conventions more enjoyable for you you can email your feedback to email thanks in advance for your help

823508 in instances where an application for permanent residency has been filed the university must confirm employment and other information however we do not and cannot make immigration related decisions for or on behalf of individuals and their immigration status
823509 on the immigration side theres no room for good faith mistakes in the law and this is one of them
823510 the use of 457 visas to employ temporary skilled migrant workers has grown rapidly in recent years a total of 39 500 subclass 457 visas was granted in 2003 04 compared with an expected 100 000 places in each of 2007 08 and 2008 09

823513 today i want to announce that mandatory detention is an essential component of strong border control but children and where possible their families will not be detained in an immigration detention centre detention that is indefinite or otherwise arbitrary is not acceptable detention in immigration detention centres is only to be used as a last resort and for the shortest practicable time
823514 in the future the immigration system will be characterised by strong border security firm deterrence of unauthorised arrivals effective and robust immigration processes and respect for the rule of law and the humanity of those seeking migration outcomes

823536 si ehra gusto niya muna tapusin school niya bago siya pumasok sa showbiz ako talagang i really wanted it ako yung pinipigilan at mag aral daw muna ako
823537 when i was young mukha akong sira ulo acting in front of the mirror
823538 oc kasi ako eh like for this year kailangan finished na ako mag aral o ganon and then when i was in college tita annabelle asked me o day gusto mo bang maging artista i thought it was one of those random things cause ang daming nagtatanong sa kin kung gusto kong mag artista eh wala namang nangyayari and then nung dumating to nawala na lahat ng plans
823539 i want to do heavy drama even before gusto ko sobrang dark na character yung psychotic people think that after posing for a mens magazine kailangan sumayaw ako o naka plunging outfit eh hindi ako ganon eh
823540 pag ini interviw ako im always referred to as the sister of michelle but weve been in showbiz for how many years na rin so hindi na ako masyadong nirerefer kay michelle as ehra na rin actually
823541 para kay michelle automatic yung outgoing nature eh kasi very sociable siya for me kasi s t nakakahiya ganon yung feeling ko i only have a few friends pero friends ko talaga hindi acquaintances or friends for the sake of having friends
823542 specialty ni michelle beef caldereta ako gusto kong niluluto yung mga sinigang o nilaga o kaya salmon bini bake ko siya at nilalagyan ko ng olive oil na may basil mga healthy healthy food
823543 sobrang enjoy ko yung showbiz sobrang eksacto rin kasi nakatulong siya financially nung may financial difficulties kami people think were related to the madrigals yung kay jamby madrigal but thats our middle name since were gaspar so hindi ko alam kung related or super malayong related kasi family ng mothers side ko is from oriental mindoro

823577 it started as camps for kids but then we started the mens team so we could play
823578 the argument came from when it started raining real hard then we were trying to blame one another for the idea of coming onto pit road
823579 bob said it was my idea and i really felt like it was his idea i had to leave the pit box because i was worried bob was going to like punch me in the neck or something
823580 i had to walk away but personally i feel like we have a good relationship we can be perfectly honest with one another and thats really valuable
823581 its not out of the ordinary for us to argue
823582 we get mad at each other we walk away and then we walk back together and calmer heads prevail and we have a discussion ninety nine percent of the time it works out for us
823583 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there
823584 bobs the smartest guy in the world we were really arguing we made light of it but we thought we made the wrong call
823585 if it keeps raining we win it didnt and we got seventh
823586 they put up a good match and we all had fun
823587 this is what he does day in and day out
823588 while playing i also was the development officer for the team
823589 i was responsible for development and expanding the sport in the bendigo area which included running tournaments leagues camps and clinics for kids
823590 in a way i was an ambassador for american basketball
823591 kids were hungry to learn the sport and seeing that really got me into wanting to come back and coach in the states
823592 it was my first job and it was great but it was still in my heart to come back home give to my community
823593 so i decided to head back to columbia and took the head basketball coaching job at hickman
823594 when i came back to columbia i decided to really get into the role of coaching teaching and development
823595 not only do we provide a place for the kids to play but we help shape them into leaders of their community
823596 the kids are required to volunteer at various events by helping coach and officiate games as well as do time and score keeping
823597 we try to shape them to be well rounded individuals since they are not only representing themselves and their team on the court but their parents their school and their town off the court
823598 i have helped coach my sons team for three years now
823599 it has been really great to see them grow and develop not only as competitors but as leaders
823600 since moving here to columbia last july the msa has provided keondre with a great opportunity to stay busy and keep away from doing things he shouldnt
823601 i do enjoy dealing with the kids at this age mainly for the fact they are at their purest
823602 they are beginning to find out if they enjoy basketball and they are having fun learning the game
823603 and finally we must know that the territorial imperative just one it is true of the evolutionary forces playing upon our lives is the biological law on which we have founded our edifices of human morality our capacities for sacrifice for altruism for sympathy for trust for responsibilities to other than self interest for honesty for charity for friendship and love for social amity and mutual interdependence have evolved just as surely as the flatness of our feet the muscularity of our buttocks and the enlargement of our brain out of the encounter on ancient african savannahs between the primate potential and the hominid circumstance
823604 the churchs teaching is that faith and the scientific evidence supporting evolution are not in conflict the theologians who went through the intellectual gymnastics required to come to that conclusion can only be pitied

823641 the increasing feasibility of nonmarket nonproprietary production of information knowledge and culture and of communications and computation capacity holds the promise of increasing the degree of autonomy for individuals in the networked information economy
823642 the remainder of this chapter is devoted to responding to these critiques providing a defense of the claim that the internet can contribute to a more attractive liberal public sphere

823667 he shall have power by and with the advice and consent of the senate to make treaties provided two thirds of the senators present concur
823668 this constitution and the laws of the united states which shall be made in pursuance thereof or which shall be made under the authority of the united states and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding
823669 acts of congress are the supreme law of the land only when made in pursuance of the constitution while treaties are declared to be so when made under the authority of the united states we do not mean to imply that there are no qualifications to the treaty making power but they must be ascertained in a different way

823673 i usually focus on a driving emotion to propel the story since the characters are somewhat short changed in the flash format ive come to realize how important pacing and readability are to accompany a readers sense of discovery so i am learning to make my writing more muscular less ostentatious and hopefully more powerful too
823674 my personal approach to flash fiction is to remember the phrase in medias res
823675 since one is so restricted by word count in flash fiction i try to aim for sentences and dialogue that pull double duty as both action and description plus i know readers have great imaginations themselves and often fill in the scenery cracks for themselves freeing up a lot of embroidery words that one might be tempted to pad the story with
823676 my goal in flash fiction is my goal in all writing to entertain and hopefully to get the reader to think a bit i definitely try to avoid superfluous description in flash fiction because you dont have the space for it with a limited word count i hate a lot of description as a reader anyhow so i try to avoid it in all my writing ive found that a good way to tell a story in a small amount of words is to use dialog to move the story along and let the readers fill in the blanks
823677 what i aim for most in a flash fiction piece is a fully realized story with a beginning middle and end though it is always a happy accident when a flash fiction piece spurs one on to write something longer i dont go into these with the notion that im writing a sketch
823678 i remind myself first that the canvas is small theres probably not room for more than two characters and usuallly only one twist of course every word has to count although ive found from experience that i can cut material pretty drastically so i dont mind if the first draft goes even a 100 to 200 words over the count im looking for then focus on the visuals

823697 okay no i dont regret it you were a cute baby
823698 but i wanted to go out on friday nights go to prom maybe college
823699 a good application i can think of for decision automation is disaster recovery can you outline a model for how one could go about implementing it
823700 i dont trust automation i need to be able to do things myself to be able to trust it
823701 oh its okay for me not to test my database backups unless some corporate mandate forces me to do so
823702 stratavia makes run book automation software for an it database or software that enables a user to define a set of processes and integrate the necessary components to execute it automatically according to gartner inc
823703 out of the 40 or so metrics you guys look at at least 10 are outdated
823704 well your report is still looking at cache hit ratios and such the prevailing sentiment in the dba community especially the oracle dba community is that hit ratios are useless what truly matters are the wait stats and trace output
823705 we think automation and omm are good things for us but we dont know how to really get started we manage so many databases and applications here that its tough to standardize anything we have no say in the matter our dbas are busy working their tails off its unrealistic to tell them to drop what they are doing and work on automating stuff its just not going to happen
823706 well the actual task only takes about 20 minutes but the logistics around it cause the task to take up 2 hours so im not sure this task can be automated or whether it would be valuable to have it automated
823707 this is a no brainer why would anyone tolerate such inefficiencies in their day to day it processes
823708 we know whats best for our business and theres a reason why we have developed certain processes to accommodate our unique needs any automation efforts need to take those into consideration
823709 we like the offering but our security policies prevent us from outsourcing our database support
823710 this is slick i have never used this new feature before
823711 oh we had no choice the vendor has desupported the earlier version
823712 were you using their support pretty regularly then and thats what prompted you to upgrade since you were at risk of not being supported any more
823713 we were already on the terminal release for that version it was stable in our environment so we werent really calling their support line at all but then we were anyway paying them support fees the upgrade didnt cost us anything so we went ahead and upgraded
823714 oh its our corporate policy that we cant have un supported software
823715 ah la mia mammina mi ha datto che se faccio la brava mi prende quello di v o
823716 promptly dumped joey and co without a second thought just like that it was over
823717 thats ok i still want to know what it is

823719 great restaurant that has great food for a resonable price
823720 the best part of bend or deschutes county for that matter is that while restaurants offer the organic ingredients their to go containers are or can be styrofoam good thing you carry a nalgene to reduce waste but you look silly walking to your hummer carrying your toomies lunch meal deal in a styrofoam box good going
823721 drink this beer whenever a glass of it is in front of you
823722 the burgers arent that great but they have the best shakes and slushies

823731 is there a chance a fragment of light at the end of the tunnel a reason to fight is there a chance you will change your mind or are we ashes and wine
823732 you had it all for a pretty little while and somehow you made me smile when i was sad you took a chance on a bruised and beaten heart and then you realized you wanted what you had i guess i should have been more like that
823733 4 am and im wide awake waiting for the thoughts to fade a flickering of all of my mistakes everybody burns when it starts to hurt i cry i feel it in my veins i just cant walk away this time your words circle in my head weigh so heavy in my chest and im crushed by your decisions it just seems i should confess who am i to pretend this is more than i can carry

823771 ini adalah satu pilihan raya yang perlu diberi perhatian serius tapi ada memperlihatkan sedikit kelainan berbanding yang sebelum ini kerana ia pilihan raya kecil pertama selepas 8 mac lalu tetapi fokusnya adalah besar
823772 saya tidak mahu mengulas aspek ini ia akan dibincangkan dengan mendalam oleh spr dalam mesyuarat rabu ini
823773 tetapi pada pandangan peribadi saya dalam pilihan raya kecil tempoh berkempen kemungkinan lebih pendek tidak memerlukan tempoh yang lama dan bukan tempat yang besar berbanding pilihan raya umum
823774 yang pastinya undang undang memperuntukkan minimum tujuh hari untuk berkempen
823775 lagipun pilihan raya umum baru diadakan pilihan raya kecil tidak memerlukan tempoh yang lama untuk berkempen
823776 saya tidak tahu sama ada saya akan dibenarkan berkempen atau tidak selepas ini sama ada saya masuk lokap atau tidak saya tetap akan bertanding di permatang pauh

823808 the undersigned petition kelowna city council to consult the electors of kelowna through a public referendum on whether or not to enact the proposed comprehensive development zone in the downtown
823809 the letters to the editor page is probably the most dangerous part of the newspaper we try to allow letter writers to say what they want in their own words and most letter writers are capable of governing themselves accordingly but some people go over the top not to be confused with free expression defamation gets unnecessarily personal it goes too far in an attempt to discredit someones opinion or actions
823810 wood is the most environmentally friendly and has the smallest carbon footprint of any building material
823811 courage to stand up to powerful governments her first challenge is going to be taking on her own president on zimbabwe
823812 this action is a direct result of the mugabe regimes continued politically motivated violence disregarding calls from the united nations to halt the attacks
823813 no regime should ignore the will of its own people and calls from the international community without consequences
823814 youve already got a lot of nervousness that zimbabwe is nearing the point of bottoming out
823815 but the idea of the u s and europeans putting this in force could raise pressure on the region to do more
823816 result in a new government that reflects the will of the zimbabwean people
823817 we are very worried there could be a gradual increase in violence which could make the mission quite vulnerable
823818 serious shortfalls in communications logistics medical evacuation and treatment and air support
823819 will continue to be extremely vulnerable in the months ahead
823820 i think this is the first shot across the bow in response to the icc action
823821 there will be more of these kinds of proxy attacks
823822 we dont have enough evidence to say it was the government
823823 weve got lots of strands of evidence but we really dont know
823824 the patrol lost communication with the sector headquarters almost immediately following the destruction of its high frequency radio set
823825 reported the appearance armament and equipment of most of the attackers as being similar to that of the janjaweed they also indicated that some assailants were dressed in clothing more akin to a uniform
823826 a weapon not normally used by irregular militias is also a new element of grave concern
823827 deliberate large scale and sustained attack on a relatively strong peacekeeper patrol constitutes a significant escalation in the risks to the mission
823828 all of us were staying in one house and he could just come and say today it is you who will sleep in my house

823830 our constitution as it is should be amended variously and in a number of ways
823831 if we put our heads together im sure we can find a solution not finding a solution is not an option
823832 to a dialogue with each other with a view to creating a genuine viable permanent and sustainable solution to the zimbabwean situation
823833 our constitution as it is should be amended variously and in a number of ways
823834 if we put our heads together im sure we can find a solution not finding a solution is not an option

823836 when the kids are hungry they go to their mother not their father and when there is less food women are the first to eat less
823837 i have nothing against my brothers and sisters black people who were born here but his father is like me his father was an immigrant i can relate to him the way i can relate to my own children hes almost like my son
823838 the fact that hes been able to come this far has opened doors for africans and african descents
823839 to the african it tells us that one can work hard and get whatever you want this is the land of opportunity
823840 one of my kids was born in sudan in a refugee camp and is intensely excited about obama one of the people on my staff is a dyed in the wool republican whos thinking about changing his affiliation so that he can vote for obama
823841 he has the hardship story of an immigrant my mom was a single mom she didnt have much but i went to school im getting my masters now
823842 the mission is so fragile it would not take much for the whole thing to come crashing down
823843 if the united nations is serious about its engagement with sudan it should tell this man to suspend what he is doing with this so called indictment there will be grave repercussions
823844 i will present my case and my evidence to the icc judges and they will take two to three months to decide
823845 we will request a warrant of arrest and the judges have to evaluate the evidence
823846 summarize the evidence the crimes and name individual s charged
823847 bashir will certainly use the indictment to justify some awful reactions such as humanitarian aid restrictions and further barriers
823848 but if the international community stands firm and makes it clear that these kinds of responses will only make matters worse for bashir then he will relent
823849 it is the prosecutors job however to follow the evidence wherever it leads regardless of the people in high positions he investigates will it be controversial you bet what is at stake here is limiting the impunity of those associated with these horrific events in darfur since 2003
823850 even the five fingers on your hand arent the same are they
823851 deprived foreign guests from finding the alcoholic beverage which they wanted and forced it upon the muslim fish of the nile
823852 the lesson of this summit is that the emphasis is on implementation and on delivery
823853 the emphasis is on turning words into action and making them far more concrete than ever they have been in the past
823854 we had a comprehensive agenda on helping those who are being affected by disease live healthy lives
823855 is not going to achieve the desired impact we are all looking for we need more money
823856 you might say it doesnt sound like a lot but we think we worked to really embed the idea of g 8 accountability
823857 in retrospect the targets they agreed to at gleneagles appear to have been a stretch
823858 several of the member governments simply are not going to meet their targets the commitments were unrealistic with good intentions
823859 i think hes part of the problem at the moment
823860 young man you must tell us next time you dont sleep at home
823861 whatever happens he has got to keep the door open
823862 for the germans bush is extremely unpopular and for the germans no issue is more important than climate change
823863 thats an issue in which she doesnt have a lot of latitude or interest in appearing too cozy
823864 given current emission trends an agreement that did not have that kind of participation by all major economies would likely be politically unacceptable and would certainly be environmentally ineffective
823865 but the people who tried to do it before either didnt know enough about television or didnt know about the u s market
823866 one of the first questions i was asked by cable operators is what makes you think you can succeed
823867 i figured people had enough of their rabbis at their weekly or monthly or annual visits to the synagogue but its become one of our most popular productions
823868 it behooves me to point out how individuals like dycke are so weak in their logic and their knowledge of the facts that they have to resort to extreme exaggeration and telling outright falsehoods to bolster their otherwise shabby arguments
823869 thats the bet our founding fathers were making all of those years that our individual destinies could be tied together in the common destiny of democracy that government depends not just on the consent of the governed but on the service of citizens
823870 thats what history calls us to do because loving your country shouldnt just mean watching fireworks on the fourth of july loving your country must mean accepting your responsibility to do your part to change it
823871 the ideal is to win however having been a veteran of three statewide races in six years i know the reality of places like el paso county
823872 people want to know not just what his proposals are or that he gives a good speech
823873 we were ready to step into the strong current of history and to answer a new call for our country but the call never came
823874 instead of a call to service we were asked to go shopping
823875 their bodies could pretty much fit in our hands and their skin was so almost translucent looking
823876 at the moment it was probably one of the hardest things probably the hardest thing ive ever gone through
823877 but looking back i dont have any bitterness or really not any sorrow about that day in particular
823878 hopefully if i can help some other baby so that maybe they can survive or it gives them a little bit of a boost im happy to do that
823879 i enjoy giving i enjoy volunteering and this is something ive been blessed to do and so im happy to share it with others that need it
823880 this was given to me to give to you when you return
823881 well now youre home so here ill give them to you
823882 he was only 25 he wasnt supposed to die but when he was alive he held his head up high
823883 but i grew up watching cartoons like superman and batman i cant put on a cape and fly but im going to do the next closest thing
823884 if i ever get recruited i want to fight for the innocent who cannot fight for themselves

823887 aquela foi uma hist ria terrivelmente depressiva para se escrever
823888 em parte porque rorschach em nada se parece comigo eu n o compartilho a sua pol tica e nem compartilho a sua filosofia ele um homem aterrorizado e em minha vis o ele acaba se rendendo ao horror do mundo mas eu penso que o fundo do po o dos medos e ansiedades de muitas pessoas pode ser igual ao do rorschach as coisas que uma vez usamos para nos abrigarmos da escurid o como deus a rainha o pa s e a fam lia foram se distanciando de n s em muitos casos temos esmagados a n s mesmos e agora nos deixamos tremendo na chuva olhando para o mundo e vendo um obst culo preto que n o tem nenhum significado moral afinal
823889 eu tive que me perguntar o que que mais me assusta e percebi que a verdade que quando o mundo acabar n o haver nenhum aviso de quatro minutos n o haver nenhum conflito nuclear de baixa escala a verdade que os m sseis poderiam estar no ar em cinco minutos e se houver um armageddon nuclear n o iremos retirar o p de n s mesmos e nem reinventar os valores humanos n o poderia haver nenhum valor humano ap s uma guerra nuclear porque n o haveria nenhum humano nosso passado seria erradicado nosso futuro seria erradicado nosso presente seria erradicado e eu me achei pensando quando as crian as foram para escola esta manh eu gritei com elas ou lhes falei que eu as amo
823890 isto est a ficar sinistro por isso devo estar a criar algo interessante

823894 honey i dont want to heat up the house and dontcha wanna save on the electric bill
823895 never doubt that a small group of committed people can change the world
823896 who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies
823897 a lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes
823898 what does love look like it has the hands to help others it has the feet to hasten to the poor and needy it has eyes to see misery and want it has the ears to hear the sighs and sorrows of men that is what love looks like
823899 everything has its wonders even darkness and silence and i learn whatever state i may be in therein to be content
823900 i have found the paradox that if you love until it hurts there can be no more hurt only more love

823904 there is a neat scene here where zorro and his horse race a train and then the horse leaps from a trestle and lands on top of the train that zorro thinks a horse would do this shows that zorro does not know much about horses as he should for that matter the horse itself is surprisingly uninformed it must have had the mumps the week the other horses studied about never jumping blind from a high place onto something that assuming it is there will be going 40 mph

823927 for a number of years the number of refugees worldwide was decreasing due to the success of massive voluntary operations in afghanistan liberia sierra leone and angola
823928 the number of refugees and internally displaced has started to rise again
823929 the violence intimidation hunger and suffering must be addressed as soon as possible zimbabweans cannot afford any more confusion or delays zimbabweans can no longer afford words that are not reinforced by actions
823930 there are many in the u s government who think we should dump the guy
823931 ambassador khalilzad made it clear to the secretary general that this is bans decision
823932 and that we will not stand in the way of what the u n thinks is best
823933 we have nominated general karenzi because he is professionally qualified and the u n has recognized he is a very good official
823934 as the force commanders contract was automatically renewed we requested to know why karenzis was not
823935 this isnt even our problem we do not produce cocaine here but it is destroying our future
823936 now we are in a situation where people are living in absolutely unacceptable conditions
823937 theres no sanitation people are scattered all over the place
823938 i am not feeling well but i went to my doctor and my blood tests are all normal
823939 if you keep doing what youve been doing then youll keep getting what youve been getting and if you could see what i see then you would do what i do
823940 now we are here they chase us away its unfair
823941 every day i wake up and say what am i going to do what am i going to eat
823942 once you give them houses or whatever well be creating a big war
823943 the question will be why are you giving them houses
823944 our main job is that the people have awareness of their rights and know how to break their handcuffs and remove their shackles
823945 our research suggests that significant levels of abuse of boys and girls continue in emergencies with much of it going unreported
823946 the victims include orphans children separated from their parents and families and children in families dependent on humanitarian assistance
823947 we wouldnt tell the police because they are afraid of the u n peacekeepers anyway ive heard that the police do this
823948 this has been sheik tareks idea for many many years
823949 its not just about yemen and djibouti its about two continents africa and asia
823950 when i talk to people about it 99 percent of the time they think its a joke at first
823951 the scale is so large that theyre not sure what to make of it
823952 the government wants the land to belong to the north
823953 we are not desiring to go to war we have been forced to fight
823954 i find this situation intolerable i want you to leave right now
823955 i know this isnt what you wanted but i wasnt sure which way to make the diagram fit best on the page so i brought both copies with me i hope you dont mind
823956 theres no more to see so lets get outta here
823957 i have to get to the airport really fast can you do that
823958 have made it impossible for a free and fair election to take place
823959 as far as the runoff is concerned the election goes ahead
823960 we cannot stand there and watch people being killed for the sake of power
823961 reinforced that its impossible for there to be a free fair or peaceful
823962 it is abundantly clear that mugabe is determined to thwart the will of the people of zimbabwe as so clearly expressed on march 29
823963 cannot be considered legitimate in the absence of a runoff
823964 our objectives are to get in every forum possible a recognition that today president mugabe no longer remains the proper rightful leader of the country
823965 since 2006 progress in response to hiv is evident in many regions
823966 however progress is uneven and the expansion of the epidemic itself is often outstripping the pace at which services are being brought to scale
823967 the breadth and severity of the epidemic remain unmatched in modern times by any other infectious diseases
823968 recent surveys have revealed increases in risk behaviors and a decline in knowledge about hiv among young people
823969 the political and security situation in zimbabwe appears not to be permissive for holding the runoff election in a manner that would be deemed free and fair
823970 holding the election under the current circumstances may undermine the credibility and legitimacy of its outcome
823971 this orchestrated campaign of violence and harassment by the regime is designed to prevent zimbabwes opposition from conducting its peaceful election campaign
823972 by its actions the mugabe regime has given up any pretense that the june 27 elections will be allowed to proceed in a free and fair manner
823973 this is an embarrassment to africa because it makes a sham of the presidential election
823974 the first impression we have is that if the elections were to take place today these elections would never be free and fair
823975 he believed if you extract the blood of virgins and smear it over the walls of your business your fortunes would multiply it was 1977
823976 it is essential that american legislators look at and be forced to deal with this issue pragmatically as a leading public health problem in the world
823977 we got a letter from yahalon mexico that was dictated to the village priest and signed with thumbprints
823978 i dont think he would have wished for this kind of scenario for himself or his country
823979 this illegitimate government of zimbabwe and those who support it
823980 i think in some respects we probably didnt do as good a job as we should have when we rolled out africom
823981 i dont think we should push african governments to a place they dont really want to go in terms of relationships
823982 there are very few scenarios which would create a u s military intervention
823983 very little was really known by the majority of people or countries in africa who were supposed to know before such a move was made
823984 you know there are certain very powerful countries who said no we are not interested in having a headquarters here
823985 i think everyone thought it would be widely greeted as something positive
823986 but you suddenly have wide publics that have no idea what were talking about it was seen as a massive infusion of military might onto a continent that was quite proud of having removed foreign powers from its soil
823987 the purpose of this is not to add military bases
823988 is the face of america in africa a baseball cap or a helmet
823989 we told the military do what youre good at stay in your lane
823990 peacekeeper training military education a counterterrorism element programs that have been going on for some time
823991 ill be candid with you there was a misunderstanding of sorts
823992 were we going to be establishing large bases bringing in large formations of troops naval bases and air squadrons my answer was no
823993 zimbabweans have also shown how brave and resilient they can be they have withstood years of brutality impoverishment and intimidation they are dedicated to a new democratic zimbabwe
823994 but we in the mdc cannot ask them to cast their vote on june 27 when that vote could cost them their lives
823995 be allowed to proceed in a free and fair manner
823996 we are busy campaigning tsvangirai is known to make these statements
823997 he must write to confirm that he is pulling out otherwise its a bluff
823998 there is no such thing as a risk free environment in this country
823999 this is close to a miracle i was certain that some things will not happen in my lifetime
824000 a black president of the u s will mean that there will be more american tolerance for people around the world who are different
824001 the primaries showed that the u s is actually the nation we had believed it to be a place that is open minded enough to have a woman or an african american as its president
824002 obama is the exciting image of what we always hoped america was
824003 we have immensely enjoyed the ride and cant wait for the next phase
824004 although no one will admit it israeli leaders are worried about obama
824005 the feeling is that this is the time to be tough in foreign policy toward the middle east and hes going to be soft
824006 seeking refuge what for these are voters they wont do you any harm
824007 the ugly incidents and scenes that have been visited on the people of zimbabwe persuade us that a run off presidential election offers no solution to zimbabwes crisis
824008 the very legitimacy of the run off has already been severely compromised by the actions of both zanu pf militants and those of state officials who do not even conceal their partiality in favor of the governing party
824009 any attempts by outside players to impose regime change will merely deepen the crisis
824010 he is only safe because alerted by friends he left in a hurry a few minutes earlier
824011 the people have already won the coming election would only reaffirm this victory
824012 zimbabweans would resoundingly defeat the regime and begin a new life with hope of a better zimbabwe
824013 he came here as president of zimbabwe and hell go home as president of zimbabwe

824027 this propaganda cell is suspected of making videos of attacks on coalition and iraqi forces which are then used to raise funds and resources for additional attacks against coalition forces and iraqis
824028 we believe that hezbollah brigades does receive support from iran
824029 the man uploads web sites with imagery and video taken from attacks on iraqi security and coalition forces
824030 reports indicate this is part of a propaganda effort in order to earn money and support from their iranian financiers
824031 the technology that has been provided to combat engineers in the past five years has saved lives on a grand scale
824032 either because of scarce resources or perhaps theyre running low on explosives theyve had to start emplacing hoax ieds just to take up our time
824033 during the first six months of the war there werent any ieds
824034 the whole ied fight is something that the army had to come up with on its own
824035 we know the road so well we just know when something is different
824036 its like where the hell did that bag come from even if its something iraqis just threw out there
824037 the fight in the north is still on going its a balanced fight pursuing insurgent on the one hand and doing reconstruction and supporting iraqi government activities
824038 when you talk about the growth of security you have to mention that the government is getting stronger
824039 they destroyed the police stations and left mosul without a government for two months
824040 you can attribute a lot of our success from sons of iraq
824041 the insurgency is no big deal now its our duty so we wont stop fighting it
824042 our solution for iraq will become obvious with the regional elections
824043 if you can get a representative government that is interested in getting essential services then the terrorist will not have a leg to stand on
824044 republicans felt they got a lot of good press out of fridays revolt so they will be back at it again

824051 margaret georges hugely long intensely romantic novel about henry viii is convincing moving and allowing a wide tolerance of romantic bias faithful to the surviving evidence about henry and the colorful personalities around him the novel is written as henrys private journal in which he lets the reader in on how he really felt and thought about his various wives his ruthless treatment of his officials and courtiers his mistresses his daughter mary and so on in each case the novelist contrasts henrys public attitudes and the historical legends that have grown up around him with his secret inner fears doubts contradictions and insights i found it compelling reading

824072 they that passed by reviled him wagging their heads and saying thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days save thyself if thou be the son of god come down from the cross likewise also the chief priests mocking him with the scribes and elders said he saved others himself he can not save if he be the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him he trusted in god let him deliver him now if he will have him for he said i am the son of god
824073 and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying eli eli lama sabachthani
824074 now there was set a vessel full of vinegar and they filled a sponge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it to his mouth when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished

824088 in the year 1840 another remarkable fulfillment of prophecy excited widespread interest two years before josiah litch one of the leading ministers preaching the second advent published an exposition of revelation 9 see this
824089 allowing the first period 150 years to have been exactly fulfilled before deacozes ascended the throne by permission of the turks and that the 391 years fifteen days commenced at the close of the first period it will end on the 11th of august 1840 when the ottoman power

824110 but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to smite his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of and shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth

824115 behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not
824116 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
824117 clouds they are without water carried about of winds trees whose fruit withereth without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots
824118 then they that feared the lord spake often one to another and the lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the lord and that thought upon his name and they shall be mine saith the lord of hosts in that day when i make up my jewels

824136 thus saith the lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither let the mighty man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his riches but let him that glorieth glory in this that he understandeth and knoweth me that i am the lord which exercise loving kindness judgment and righteousness in the earth for in these things i delight saith the lord
824137 the lord is well pleased for his righteousness sake he will magnify the law and make it honorable
824138 but this is a people robbed and spoiled they are all of them snared in holes and they are hid in prison houses they are for a prey and none delivereth for a spoil and none saith restore
824139 the man that shall be unclean and shall not purify himself that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation
824140 for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god
824141 add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity
824142 for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ
824143 i dont care i am going right contrary to the law that god has given in his word i dont ask him to take my word i dont ask him to do it
824144 i do the works of my father the works that i saw him do i do

824172 it is true that evolution teaches that there was death prior to adam ham uses romans 5 12 and 1 corinthians 15 21 22 which state that death came by sin i agree whereas ham believes this includes animal death old earth creationists hold the opposite view that this represents human death the passages involved can be interpreted either way
824173 if you look closely at the curse he cursed adam eve and satan he did not curse the whole of creation yes the whole creation groaneth but a better interpretation is that the creation groans under the oppression of sinful man we see that clearly today in the pollution global warming and other issues that show how man is failing to take care of gods creation
824174 and god said behold i have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat and to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life i have given every green herb for meat and it was so
824175 many animals are uniquely designed as predators and their digestive systems are designed to process meat
824176 james morrison has a huge international following as a dynamic musician and composer and is also highly regarded as a great communicator and educator mr dunn said
824177 he loves to encourage students and our band and ensemble members are excited about the opportunity to workshop rehearse and perform with a world class entertainer
824178 firstly we want to inspire our music students by giving them a great performance opportunity with one of the worlds best musicians
824179 the second purpose is to help develop an audience for james and other performers of his level in the central west our hope is that in the future the central west may be included in tour schedules
824180 earlier this year st johns college brought the vocal group the idea of north to dubbo and sent them home with a much better opinion of our city we hope to do the same with james morrison and his band
824181 mr morrison will play with school bands and ensembles for the first hour of the concert mr dunn said
824182 a couple of hundred students will be involved music will range from symphonic through to jazz
824183 the concert will be a huge cultural boost for dubbo we are going to a lot of trouble with lighting audiovisual screen and new tiered staging so that the audience can see every performer
824184 we have a good relationship with kamo since the gardens inception the head of the schools landscape and design designed dubbos shoyeon gardens and this is the second year that we have hosted graduates from the school
824185 shoyeon has been named by visiting japanese consulate as one of the best most authentic japanese gardens in the state and these annual visits will assure council maintains this high level of authenticity
824186 we hope to make these visits an annual event it gives graduates from kamo an opportunity to showcase their skills and gives councils parks and landcare team hands on training in traditional japanese pruning and shaping methods
824187 well do so in a practical way by providing the necessary training places to support those indigenous australians to make them training ready to go into those companies which andrew forrest will help us bring about
824188 its a practical program its a big plan on his part its a big initiative on his part very tough goals hes set for himself but were prepared to support his enterprise by assisting with these training places
824189 id hate to guess how many people went through the place from the time the housemates arrived
824190 we gave the kids a chance first up and then the older ones poured in its amazing because you hear a lot of people say they didnt like the show but they still turned up to see these people
824191 it looks like its been one of our biggest nights ever
824192 the guys that turned up were great they signed whatever had to be signed and they hung around and chatted
824193 nobbi in particular was a great bloke i had a quick beer with him beforehand and he was probably the last one to go
824194 we see a bit of a hole in entertainment in dubbo and we showed on saturday night that people love being able to go to a big event
824195 i was not a brilliant knitter so i was a bit apprehensive
824196 but i came along to a sew up day and i became enthusiastic when i realised i could be doing something so appreciated by people in dire circumstances
824197 people have seen their own rugs in uganda where they were needed
824198 maths is easier in australia than in japan but english is harder
824199 the food is very very delicious but the weather is very cold here in dubbo
824200 there is a lot of space much less crowded than at home
824201 the students went to an aboriginal cultural camp at balladoran on friday where they experienced aboriginal culture and boomerang throwing
824202 on saturday night they had a bonfire and a barbecue and next week they go to a farm on the macquarie river
824203 a lot of time goes into being a councillor and a lot of that gets taken away from family time
824204 i havent made my mind up yet whether i am going to nominate again its something ill discuss a bit more with my family in the next week or so
824205 i spoke to a lot of people on saturday and got some fairly brutal and honest feedback which was good
824206 as soon as i got back from annual leave i started campaigning i believe myself and ben shields are the only councillors doing so at the moment
824207 that surprises me because i believe anyone who is serious and has the fire in their belly should be out among the people already
824208 its an insult to the public for anyone to sit on their hands and think they should be re elected based on being an incumbent

824257 we have absolutely seen the drug trade equivalent the business model for infecting these machines either to steal their bandwidth and their processor power and sell it to the highest bidder to direct those machines to all try to load a single website at once to bring down that website or weve started to see both the use of those zombie machines to send spam and to harvest personal details off those machines
824258 when you have a machine called the generic personal computer your laptop and it can wonderfully run any code you give it and the maker of the laptop has nothing to say about it that is also a real vulnerability
824259 and then you get into a realm where i worry that the cure will be as bad as the problem

824264 i intend to do as much as i can to win in 2008
824265 theres no doubt it helps not to have granberg on the ballot
824266 and it doesnt look like the democrats are too excited about their candidate either
824267 we could see things had changed when almost 800 people showed up at our spring fundraiser
824268 weve been working hard to make sure this leads to a pickup for the republicans in november
824269 were focused on next november and bringing jobs into the area we need good jobs available in this district to keep our kids interested in coming back home to raise their families
824270 wed like to open up rt 50 to make it more accessible
824271 if we can get republican values leading in this area it will make a big difference
824272 republicans always look to build bigger and increase profit democrats fight to maintain control to keep things small and make voters dependent on them
824273 weve got to help our young people have a reason to return to the area
824274 but right now theyre building businesses and raising their families while helping me get elected its for the future
824275 john and his wife connie and two salt of the earth people from central illinois
824276 we all felt cheated when john didnt win in 2006 were pleased to have him included this year in our 8 in 08 candidate program we need more tough conservative leadership like johns in the illinois house
824277 republicans are having a hard time getting excited about backing any candidate this election season but the future of illinois is at stake
824278 conservative republicans can get excited about exceptional conservative candidates like john cavaletto who have excellent chances of winning in 2008 despite obamania

824280 in a make or break year for nolan alex etc do you really think nolan would be that stupid to override martzs decision
824281 there is some thought this morning that alex smith might get some rest today
824282 rather than get ahead of ourselves for lack of a better word were going to be manipulating it to get it right
824283 its probably why they get along as a group pretty well if two of them were like j t there might be some in house duking
824284 and if there were two of them like alex or shaun its just not enough competition its a good complement for one another kind of like opposites attract
824285 smith said he learned yesterday that his arm would get a break today
824286 there is no difference between responsibilities as a de or olb

824300 genetics and biology account for most individual differences in weight
824301 most obesity in the modern world is a natural biological response to a changed environment and that innate body weight regulatory mechanisms have been overwhelmed by energy dense diets and sedentary lifestyles
824302 the results of these studies show that obesity is not primarily due to energy saving mechanisms it can be inferred from these data that the positive energy balance that leads to obesity is mainly due to an excessive energy intake

824335 ive always thought there are two kinds of celebrities there are people who really want to be celebrities there are other people who want to be good at their craft the ones who want to be famous are the ones who you hear about all the time the ones who are studying and honing their craft have to do that out of the spotlight you cant learn anything when youre out in the spotlight all the time

824345 you know me better than that i have immense respect for malaika and i love arhaan arbaaz and malaikas son and arbaaz we had a great time

824368 be yourself all that you are now doing thinking desiring is not you yourself
824369 the parrhesiast is the one who speaks the truth as ethos and speaks in her own name the parrhesiast has an obligation to use language to articulate the truth she knows and the language she uses is defined by its clarity and its directness in speaking truth as ethos the parrhesiast says not what will be not what is and not the tradition but reveals to the listener the listeners own truth the listeners ethos by speaking in such a way that the listener is thrown back upon himself in other words the parrhesiast does not tell the other who he is objectively rather the manner of speaking in parrhesia provokes the listener brings the listener into a new relationship with himself and unlike the prophet who leaves the others with the task of interpretation the parrhesiast whose meaning is all too clear leaves the others with the difficult task of accepting the truth
824370 be yourself all that you are now doing thinking desiring is not you yourself

824381 it amazing to tell you the truth i think its a blessing to know that its not like the first time we came out here to bury him and relive and to rebury him again but instead we came out here to celebrate the life of both firefighters
824382 i think its time to start honoring them and stop mourning
824383 had it not for some highly inflammatory speeches there would have been no trouble in samba at all such acts are condemnable
824384 someone shouted that there had been a landslide at the hill top chaos struck and people started running to save their lives
824385 had the police not lathicharged the pilgrims hundreds of lives would have been saved there was no arrangement for any such mishap

824387 five six people died in front of me due to electric shock my friend was lucky to have survived as he jumped away from the railing which collapsed due to the pilgrims
824388 we were at a distance when people started running over each other it lasted for about half an hour followed by screams cries and howls of children and women in the end there were people lying on the stairs on the side of the hill from where they had tried to run for a shortcut to avoid the stampede but failed
824389 the congress president wanted the bjps help in controlling the jammu situation i told soniaji that the union government must come up with some concrete proposals in keeping with the agitating peoples demands i have never seen this kind of anger against the government being witnessed in jammu today
824390 soniaji told the bjp president that the no political party should politicise the issue of amaranth shrine land and all parties should work together to restore peace in the state the government is trying its best to come to an amicable solution but nobody should try to take advantage of the tense situation there
824391 state might have to pay a huge price in form of an unbridgeable chasm between jammu and the valley

824393 on this moon clouds with convective movements are formed and therefore static electrical fields and stormy conditions can be produced
824394 this also considerably increases the possibility of organic and prebiotic molecules being formed according to the theory of the russian biochemist alexander i opar n and the experiment of stanley l miller
824395 that is why titan has been one of the main objectives of the cassini huygens joint mission of nasa and the european space agency
824396 in a stable fall without balancing the mip would have measured the electrical fields weak tangential component
824397 but fortunately a strong wind balanced the probe and the electrodes measured a superposition of that tangential and radial component
824398 what do i need to learn in order to be successful in my career
824399 gp is interesting to biologists because it can tell us which strategies animals use when foraging
824400 the approach works well for very different animals from bees and bats to great white sharks
824401 this is the first observation that really pins down that titan has a surface lake filled with liquid
824402 detection of liquid ethane in ontario lacus confirms a long held idea that lakes and seas filled with methane and ethane exist on titan
824403 this is the first observation that really pins down that titan has a surface lake filled with liquid
824404 detection of liquid ethane in ontario lacus confirms a long held idea that lakes and seas filled with methane and ethane exist on titan
824405 raises expectations for exciting future lake discoveries by the infrared spectrometer
824406 we know the lake is liquid because it reflects essentially no light at 5 micron wavelengths
824407 it was hard for us to accept the fact that the feature was so black when we first saw it more than 99 9 percent of the light that reaches the lake never gets out again for it to be that dark the surface has to be extremely quiescent mirror smooth no naturally produced solid could be that smooth
824408 we can see theres a shelf a beach that is being exposed as the lake evaporates
824409 they have developed a tool that allows you to look at cellular changes on a very local level
824410 this development represents an attempt to start using nanoscale tools to understand how disease develops
824411 nano voltmeters do not perturb the cellular environment and you can control where you put them
824412 its bound to be important but nobody has looked at it yet
824413 lake baikal probably the most beautiful place ive ever been im thinking especially right now of the day i spent on olkhon island when the wildflowers were spectacular and the serenity was awe inspiring it is the worlds most ancient lake with a proliferation of biodiversity that is breathtaking
824414 where i would usually see 2 species of a particular type of crustacean amphipods in this case instead i see 344 species in all shapes and colors and sizes many of the unique fish in baikal resemble deep sea fishes rather than other freshwater fish that are more closely related to them with big eyes and spindly bodies also sponge forests are common if you are surprised that im mentioning a sponge forest in a lake its for a good reason they are not that common in lakes
824415 so here you are in this incredibly cold lake at fairly high latitude and underwater this sponge forest looks more like the caribbean than the subarctic it is really like a freshwater galapagos in the midst of siberia
824416 so many organisms in and around lake baikal have evolved only in lake baikal and they are very well adapted to an extremely cold environment that is covered by ice for much of the year more than half of the animals in baikal are not found anywhere else lake baikal has been around for 25 million years so there has been plenty of time for organisms to evolve to its special environment the warming associated with climate change is very abrupt and its not clear whether or how these special organisms can adapt to a rapidly warming lake
824417 the major outcome of this paper is the maintenance issue

824435 we found a large number of mud pots and mud volcanoes many of which were lined up beyond the accepted end of the san andreas fault
824436 some geologists knew about a few of these pots and one even suggested many years ago that they might indicate a fault

824438 everyone has assumed we age by rust but how do you explain animals that dont age some tortoises lay eggs at the age of 100 there are whales that live to be 200 and clams that make it past 400 years
824439 our data just didnt fit the current model of damage accumulation and so we had to consider the alternative model of developmental drift
824440 we found a normal developmental program that works in young animals but becomes unbalanced as the worm gets older
824441 it accounts for the lions share of molecular differences between young and old worms
824442 but then how do you explain animals that dont age
824443 a free radical doesnt care if its in a human cell or a worm cell
824444 the take home message is that aging can be slowed and managed by manipulating signaling circuits within cells
824445 this is a new and potentially powerful circuit that has just been discovered for doing that
824446 its a new way to think about how to slow the aging process

824450 in addition to all the cooperation theres also a lot comparing notes one thing everyone has noted is the large number of useful gadgets american special forces troops have the most envied item is the american raven uav
824451 it has been identified as an operational requirement for op archer roto 2 in august
824452 three of the raven b systems are planned for delivery to the jaegerkorpset army special forces with the remainder destined for troop testing by deployed units at the danish armys artillery training center
824453 numerous foreign customers have already expressed a strong interest in this system and a number of export systems have been delivered recently
824454 a tender involving 10 of the leading uav manufacturers worldwide
824455 we performed a thorough competitive selection process and the raven came out as a clear winner decisive elements in the selection were hand launchability reliability ease of use robustness and proven in theatre operational performance
824456 the customers high satisfaction with the orbiters operational performance in afghanistan over the past year has led to a sharp increase in aeronautics activities in poland now a member of nato and to the decision by the polish ministry of defense to equip its other land forces with a large number of similar systems

824471 robotic exploration probably will always be the trail blazer for human exploration of far space
824472 we havent yet landed a human being on mars but we have a robot there now in that sense its much easier to send a robotic explorer when you can take the human out of the loop that is becoming very exciting
824473 the arms are the tools but its about the intent to move the arms thats what were after to have the robot know that something there is interesting and thats where it needs to go and then to go get a sample from it thats what weve after you want to get rid of the joystick in other words you want the system to take control of itself and then basically use its own tools to explore
824474 in the old star wars movies especially in the empire strikes back the empire was sending out probes or floating robots
824475 those were ideal robotic explorers because they floated over planets and had sensors and communication capabilities once you venture out to other planets you need something that can operate on its own you cant monitor and supervise every single step you want to deploy something that on its own can start a reconnaissance of the area and report back
824476 when a geologist goes into the field they can tell you if they see something that sparks their interest based on that interest it triggers more refined research but the problem is if you encounter something that scientists had not foreseen then you run the risk of not detecting it well equip it with a database and a wish list along with the ability to flag an anomaly
824477 it takes more than hour to send communications back and forth to a space probe at saturn or titan
824478 it is not a problem so much if you are dealing with a lander which is immobile or when youre dealing with a rover which is not moving too fast
824479 of course that doesnt mean we should look for the answers

824489 the peruvian margin is one of the most active surface waters in the world and lots of organic matter is continuously being deposited there
824490 the results show that this subsurface environment is the most unique environment yet studied metagenomic approach known today
824491 the world does look very different below the sediment surface
824492 in essence these microbes are almost practically dead by our normal standards

824648 but if its left in overdrive because of chronic stressors then the long term effects on biology sleep and appetite disturbance irritability episodic violence control issues can be associated with the wear and tear on our systems

824707 the extent of this perennial sea ice and the area it covers are
824708 from what we know of how arctic sea ice behaves after nearly 30 years of continuous satellite observations this kind of drop in sea ice usually takes more than three years to happen the rapid trend of the perennial ice previously reported in 2002 appears now to be in an because arctic ice cover varies so much year to year it can be dangerous to look at any one year and draw too much of a conclusion from it
824709 but this year the amount of ice is so far below that of previous years that it really is cause for concern the trend in decreasing ice cover seems to be getting stronger and stronger as time goes on
824710 when there is less sea ice in the summer the arctic ocean receives more heat the warmer water makes it harder for the ice to recover in the winter and therefore there is a higher likelihood that sea ice will retreat farther during the summer this process repeats itself year after year
824711 the longer this process continues the less likely recovery becomes
824712 the implications on global climate are not well known but they have the potential to be quite large since the arctic ice cover exhibits a tremendous influence on our climate it really is imperative that we try to understand the interactions between the ice ocean and atmosphere and satellites hold the key to developing this understanding
824713 persistent melting on the ross ice shelf is something we should not lose sight of because of the ice shelfs role as a brake system for glaciers

824776 and how we burned in the camps later thinking what would things have been like if every security operative when he went out at night to make an arrest had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say goodbye to his family or if during periods of mass arrests as for example in leningrad when they arrested a quarter of the entire city people had not simply sat there in their lairs paling in terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes hammers pokers or whatever else was at hand the organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and notwithstanding all of stalins thirst the cursed machine would have ground to a halt
824777 any ancient deeply rooted autonomous culture especially if it is spread on a wide part of the earths surface constitutes an autonomous world full of riddles and surprises to western thinking

824786 we need to assist poor countries to train more health staff provide commensurate salaries to enable them to live better lives and carry out their work
824787 three million people globally have access to drugs but six million do not aids is far from over
824788 there is a need to expand treatment to those who do not yet have treatment
824789 these people are uncared for because of the terrain of the country and there are not enough resources to provide services
824790 you need healthcare workers to administer the drugs without healthcare workers drugs are useless
824791 average life expectancy in malawi has fallen from 62 to 39 mainly due to aids with fewer staff it also means that people with other diseases are also not being taken care of
824792 where are the twenty something millennial bloggers writing about social change activism and nonprofits
824793 the stereotype is almost perfect conservative bloggers are content to act like pundits while liberal bloggers are activists
824794 as you drive beyond dressler road theres a lot being built and new stores going in even though theres some vacancies i dont see it as a high vacancy factor
824795 because were still seeing decent demand commercial business is still stable despite other negative market conditions
824796 we might have a few more vacancies than we usually do but its not unusually high
824797 i think were still in good shape in jackson township were still the strongest commercial area in stark county and were probably better off than most areas

824800 this is just one step in the process but a pretty big step
824801 if a union is an exclusive bargaining unit there are certain procedures that must take place
824802 when these two employees were terminated local 92 was not certified and they didnt attempt to become certified until after the terminations
824803 would reflect the merger of local 113 into local 92 and to amend the certification to show local 92 instead of local 113 as the exclusive representative
824804 the township is required to recognize and bargain with local 92 as the successor to local 113 under the 2004 06 agreement as demonstrated by the stipulated facts and joint exhibits the township itself recognized local 92 as the successor to the 2004 06 agreement following the merger in 2005 both before and after the filing of the subject grievances this recognition included continuing the terms and conditions of the 2004 06 agreement it is clear that local 92 was and continues to be the exclusive representative for the bargaining unit employees notwithstanding the townships belated and erroneous claims that for purposes of arbitrating the subject grievance local 92 was not party to the 2004 06 agreement
824805 and we wanted to give the young female athletes of stark and surrounding counties the chance to participate in the weeks activities by allowing them to work with a professional cheerleader
824806 i think that when a guy coaches for a long time as i have done and many other people have done theres a percent of what i do that i will never change and never abandon
824807 but over my 35 years coaching and 25 years as a head coach there are some things that are new almost every year i think thats the way it has to be if a guy wants stay in the business and be successful
824808 were practicing in the morning and evening and giving them an extended break
824809 the reason being is that we want to push them harder we want to practice a little longer theyve got a six hour break between practices and we feel we have to do that accelerate their development as players
824810 were going to coach from the smartest kid we have the best learner to the kids who struggle to learn were going to try to uplift him by doing that by throwing everything at him rather than teaching from the bottom up thats a totally different approach than what ive had in the past
824811 this is a new adventure and experience for me and the kids and if not all my coaches were taking a totally new approach to two a days not just with regard to when we practice but with our philosophy of installation were going to throw it all at them
824812 i have two sons who were graduate assistants in college and thats how they did it
824813 i have a son who is in the nfl and thats the way they go about their business i think that were capable of this its a new and novel approach for us but again it makes sense to me to teach from the top down and try to uplift those guys on the bottom rather than teaching from the bottom up
824814 in retrospect when i did that all i did was hold back our best people our smartest people i may have made a mistake doing that at my previous two stops as a head coach
824815 i dont know that its important or not but i do know that were further along now than we were at this time a year ago
824816 this is an extremely different approach for me and so far different appears to be better
824817 youre going to see a ton of them on the field
824818 we might have as many as five wideouts on the field so those guys are going to end up figuring into our plans im really pleased with them theyve got a good work ethic they help each other out i think we have a good chance to have a pretty good receiving corps all the way up the young guys all the way up to the varsity guys
824819 coach halls done a good job of using a lot of the routes they used last year
824820 hes incorporated a lot of his stuff but hes used some of the stuff we used last year the play callings similar so its not something 100 kids have to learn hes kind of put the hat on himself that thats something hell have to learn hes made it very good to the kids as far as adapting to his schemes by using a lot of the same terminology we used last year
824821 any long run you see in a football game obviously the plays been well executed on the line of scrimmage to get the back to the second and third level
824822 when they get into the second and third levels thats when the wide receivers come into play and they have to be sustaining blocks in order to shake those guys on the long runs i told our guys the same thing were going to break some long runs this year and when we do its going to be the result of us blocking downfield so theyve kind of got that in their mindset that thats what they want to get done
824823 first thing theyre going to have to be able to get a block to get downfield and sustain their blocks
824824 we have a lot of young receivers and theyre not necessarily the strongest guys right now so at times theyre getting overpowered but thats the first thing im looking for just sustaining a block
824825 obviously route running is important just getting to the right places at the right times and then when you get there you have to be able to make the catch and finish the job
824826 everyone needs to be more aware of prostate cancer the players especially
824827 len dawson our quarterback about four or five years ago he had it
824828 i think there are a lot of men who are afraid of it
824829 part of the problem however is that screening is the only way for early detection there are no symptoms a lot of men dont understand why if they dont have symptoms they would need the screening
824830 i come here get an orange and a doughnut and had the screening done it only takes about 30 minutes and its really not that bad its better than waiting too long and needing to have an operation
824831 that premier people like pro football hall of famers would have a screening done and talk about it in order to bring awareness
824832 alexander solzhenitsyn who has died at the age of 89 played a significant role in ending communism his novels were beautifully crafted damning indictments of the repressive soviet regime born into a family of cossack intellectuals alexander solzhenitsyn graduated in mathematics and physics but within weeks the soviet union was fighting hitler for its survival
824833 for the running backs were the closest ones to him
824834 he kind of has to take a little zip off it
824835 hes like a big randy johnson randy johnson throwing a football
824836 he started getting a little more touch on the ball rather than just trying to zip it in there
824837 you know anderson can throw the dart but now it comes in with a little bit of a loft when hes trying to throw it with more touch hell put a little zip on it but it will kind of be floating to you
824838 i would say hes definitely in the top 25 percent
824839 i mean brett and derek both throw it pretty hard i havent batted one of dereks balls down yet i batted one of bretts balls he busts some skin
824840 between him and brady quinn theres a good competition to see whos got the fastest ball
824841 but he throws the ball in catchable spots its not that hard to catch it thats what practice is for
824842 you know youre going to have a chance to break on some balls
824843 well he has a big arm and that helps him be a good player but at that position its not only the arm
824844 this is the ultimate honor that a father can give a son
824845 while every kid grows up thinking his father is the greatest today validates my belief my dads induction to the pro football hall of fame means that he was not only one of the greatest to play his position but one of the elites to ever play the game period
824846 see the definition of a true hall of famer is someone who is great at everything my dad was a great football player yeah but hes an even better man son brother father friend businessman and most importantly man of god
824847 to think that this man who was so ferocious and intimidating on the field could be so gracious and thoughtful off of it to me these are the traits that make andre so special
824848 andres retirement coincided with my purchase of the team and the standard of excellence he had on the field has translated to the front office where his impact continues to resonate through our entire organization and the entire new england community
824849 when gary asked me to be his presenter my first concern i guess was that i was going to have a difficult time explaining how good he really was
824850 an offensive lineman doesnt usually get very much attention gary wanted very little of it but theres no doubt in my mind that for five years he was the mainstay of our offensive line and the major reason that we were able to go and win our first super bowl in 1997
824851 i think one of the things that gary was very good at was inspiring his teammates and when he arrived in colorado in denver he sat his other four offensive linemen down and he said this is what were going to do were going to work our tails off were never going to talk to the press and were going to have our own corner of the locker room and from that moment on our offensive line in my humble opinion became one of the better offensive lines in football
824852 to the class of 2008 emmitt fred art darrell and gary you guys exemplify character pride and desire
824853 i am honored to be forever linked to you guys congratulations to you
824854 i stand before you today a proud and gracious man who knows more than anything i could not have done it alone
824855 it takes an incredible supporting cast to become a hall of famer i have been coached by and teammates with so many amazing individuals and i wish i had the time to list you all by name
824856 standing up here on this platform is much different than i imagined a lot has taken place over the past couple of months the reality of getting into the pro football hall of fame didnt really hit me until a couple of days ago as there was an overwhelming sense of is this really going to happen and even more as i stepped up on this stage and just seeing the magnitude of all this and all of you i appreciate your support
824857 hes improved so much his arm strength you know its not what it was before he first got hurt but it was pretty close
824858 we made him work a little bit there in the middle innings but we didnt take advantage of it that was really the difference for us
824859 thats a good start to having him back in the rotation
824860 in the fifth inning and sixth inning i got the ball up a little bit
824861 they made me pay they put some good swings on the ball
824862 but i cant say specifically which budgets will be affected
824863 almost half of the cost goes to the salary of the teacher who is involved in the case
824864 the school also has to pay for a substitute teacher and of course the legal expenses themselves
824865 seek out and bring back to the naples central school district information about programs schools techniques and literature representing best practice or emerging trends in education
824866 thats what weve decided and i cant comment on the subject
824867 we are currently in the process of sorting through the documents that are potentially responsive to this request and will provide you further information
824868 we do the best we can to make it look visually appropriate
824869 its a good responsibility builder for our daughter and she could show them at fairs
824870 there is so much sadness in these books why the destruction why the punishment
824871 why the difference what makes the new testament so different from the older books that its message should contrast so much with the older books
824872 the first day campers come down sometimes they hit the target sometimes they dont
824873 the next day they come down and they just pick it up so fast they are out there breaking balloons and having a grand time it just makes me feel good that im able to do that for them
824874 without even thinking about it i said mind if i try to help you
824875 by feeling his shoulders hands head and the way he was holding things i got him to hit the target i had to turn around and go back behind the archery shed because i was crying so much i realized i can teach i can do this
824876 nine out of 10 times shes worked with a kid he would hit the plate dead on
824877 the original london production has been running for 56 years
824878 if youve never seen it you are sure to be on the edge of your seat and in the tradition of the original production we ask those who have seen the play not to reveal the solution to the mystery
824879 this summer our schedules just meshed together and worked out
824880 im really having a good time you really get a welcoming vibe i feel like im coming home in a sense this place really helps you feel that way
824881 i always knew this was what i wanted to do
824882 he has a lot of heart hes just a good guy trying to do whats right
824883 hes not apt to admit when hes wrong and hes a tad bit lazy at the beginning of the play but it gets knocked out of him by the circumstances of the play i think its an admirable growth and i like that about him its more than you can hope for to play a character that brings out something good in you
824884 i would encourage residents in the county to be aware of orange cones on the road marking hazards
824885 we literally watch the weather every minute of every day
824886 were a weather dependent business and we know that we have to make those changes accordingly
824887 there was pretty intense lightning i was watching it from my bedroom window
824888 every big willow was hit somehow the rope swing is just gone
824889 it was just this huge wind i never expected to hear something like that it was incredible and so short less than a minute
824890 she was in shock because she thought his davids foot had been severed
824891 he will be laid up for quite a while though
824892 the purpose is to alert people that there is inbound traffic
824893 youve got a lot of pedestrian traffic as well as vehicular traffic
824894 i also dont want a delay because were trying to deal with a second situation
824895 i think its going to be more helpful to pedestrians than anything else
824896 the siren is annoying but if it helps save a life i dont care
824897 there have been numerous occasions when my pager doesnt trip
824898 anytime youre around any electronic equipment you have to turn off the pagers because theyre nothing but static
824899 out of 300 to 350 people we had no nos
824900 especially for the older people its a feeling of security
824901 gt mike heins points to damaged caused to his house by a tree that fell during the storm on thursday it is the second time that the tree has fallen on his vine street home
824902 and i just thought it would be a little inconvenience
824903 suspended welch with pay and brought charges under section 3020a of state education law against welch alleging misconduct on sept 26 2007
824904 board members need to respect the items that should or shouldnt be discussed during executive session
824905 i dont think its right to render my personal opinion
824906 the word personnel is a term that people use to keep public information private embarrassment isnt grounds to not disclose public information people have a right to know if people are on paid leave
824907 he told us that we arent allowed to bring up items during the meetings
824908 we have to ask before the start of the meeting to get the ok to discuss the topics
824909 in the u k every town you go to you have a market square its a combination of food bric a brac and antique stalls
824910 a lot of these were bought on our lunch hour
824911 one of the last few remaining privately owned ceramic studios left was established by tony and anita carter in debenham suffolk in 1978
824912 i dont think we would have thought of doing this had we not been given these antique teapots
824913 for me this is another way to share the eccentric history of tea with visitors to dallywaters
824914 although most of the teapots in our collection are either too valuable or perhaps impractical to actually make tea in every one has its own personality and story to tell
824915 obviously the western region has fairly well dominated over the last few years
824916 i think there are a couple of reasons behind that
824917 the thing we have to remember each year is that we are not a developmental program we are looking for the best and our coaches are very well versed at doing that we are participating in 28 sports and i expect we will do exceedingly well again this year
824918 i get to meet a lot of new people and i expect it will be the same again this year i did this two years ago when it was in rochester and i didnt do that great because the 400 and the 800 were run close together last year i ran just the 800 and finished second even though there has been no change in the schedule im still going to run both races this year
824919 im not really sure how ill do but im looking to go do my best and have some fun
824920 i have been playing aau ball for the western ny lady lakers since practice started in march
824921 we have been practicing once a week with tournaments every other weekend we also just had our last practice for western and other than that i have been working out at home a lot as a team we are expecting to do pretty good
824922 i feel im in pretty good shape heading into the games
824923 i play pretty much all year round in tournaments and local matches plus i play with my family a lot too will sacco naples tennis grad has been a big help he and his grandfather bill coleman victor tennis coach have been helping a lot its my second year last year went pretty well i played second doubles and we lost just one match
824924 this year playing second singles will be a little more difficult definitely more of a challenge
824925 from the president on down they are the most gracious hosts the last time they welcomed us with open arms and i expect the same thing this time
824926 what do you want ask and i will give it to you
824927 you showed faithful love to your servant my father david because he was honest and true and faithful to you and you have continued your faithful love to him today by giving him a son to sit on his throne ord my god you have made me king instead of my father david but i am like a little child who doesnt know his way around 8 and here i am in the midst of your own chosen people a nation so great and numerous they cannot be counted 9 give me an understanding heart so that i can govern your people well and know the difference between right and wrong for who by himself is able to govern this great people of yours
824928 because you have asked for wisdom in governing my people with justice and have not asked for a long life or wealth or the death of your enemies 12 i will give you what you asked for i will give you a wise and understanding heart such as no one else has had or ever will have 13 and i will also give you what you did not ask for riches and fame no other king in all the world will be compared to you for the rest of your life 14 and if you follow me and obey my decrees and my commands as your father david did i will give you a long life
824929 what do you want ask and i will give it to you
824930 you showed faithful love to your servant my father david because he was honest and true and faithful to you and you have continued your faithful love to him today by giving him a son to sit on his throne ord my god you have made me king instead of my father david but i am like a little child who doesnt know his way around 8 and here i am in the midst of your own chosen people a nation so great and numerous they cannot be counted 9 give me an understanding heart so that i can govern your people well and know the difference between right and wrong for who by himself is able to govern this great people of yours

824932 both jess and lisa have had an incredibly difficult week and without doubt i am talking to them and helping them out where i can
824933 from the whole situation with the pictures to lisas break up with dean i cant even imagine how they are coping with it all
824934 what has happened with those images is obviously completely illegal and there are lawyers getting involved
824935 its just such an upsetting situation there is a real tall poppy situation in australia and both jess and lisa deserve more support especially from their australian fans
824936 at the moment they are being advised not to say anything because theyre still getting their head around it themselves its all been pretty crazy
824937 but if things keep progressing between them they wont have a problem discussing it further down the track
824938 we have had no discussions with seven management about anything to do with her leaving
824939 shes in the middle of a long term contract and shes completely happy
824940 mel and david have always done contracts separately theres no pact between them
824941 it sounds like somebody at nine trying to disrupt the harmony of the olympics on seven and put doubt in peoples minds on their relationship
824942 n o poderia deixar de considerar se propaganda da situa o visto que nas condi es das duas candidaturas sem falar sequer na posi o ideol gica de quem mo pedia era praticamente voto aberto

824948 its going to be a fashion extravaganza with the contestants showcasing their final collection but there will not be a live element
824949 therefore i urge you brothers in view of gods mercy to offer your bodies as living sacrifices holy and pleasing to god this is your spiritual act of worship do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind then you will be able to test and approve what gods will is his good pleasing and perfect will
824950 for we know that our old self was crucified with jesus christ so that the body of sin might be done away with that we should no longer be slaves to sin because anyone who has died has been freed from sin in the same way count yourselves dead to sin but alive to god in christ jesus
824951 making it our purpose and joy to do what is pleasing to god we will fail as we always do but the point is to admit it and get right back on the bike
824952 give god your life and he will give you the life you want
824953 i dont let my own kids in the backyard and i will not let you either
824954 if i were a betting man well reach an agreement with the iraqis
824955 we can put unmanned aircraft predator reaper and other assets overhead for long endurance periods we call that persistent stare
824956 and with the reaper armed with hellfire and 500 pound precision weapons well be able to have a deadly stare if needed
824957 persistent hunter killer against emerging targets to achieve joint force commander objectives
824958 the thing about unmanned aerial vehicles is they can stay overhead for a long time and not use a lot of gas
824959 more and more of these drones and reduce the manned fighters and bombers overhead
824960 governor of saladdeen hamad al qaisi for the killing of his son by u s troops
824961 it was one of those moments where everything went blurry and my jaw fell to the floor so he had to ask me again
824962 of course i said yes it was incredible it wasnt some cheesy proposal with any orchestrated stunts it was just him and i in the middle of the lake doing what we do best having a laugh

824966 a touching tribute to common sense and cosys universal sense of wonder
824967 she is desperate to settle down and start a family
824968 once you strip away the dirt and the muck and the filth and the stories she is actually really really good
824969 that chiselled face could do with some foundation blush and a good old fashioned rest under the shade of a palm tree to help her wrestle back her femininity
824970 the lord jesus christ be with thy spirit grace be with you amen
824971 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen
824972 we must do something just in case we are responsible because the consequences are too terrible if we are to blame and do nothing

824984 el segundo embajador misionero tiene una funci n complementaria pero seguir n accionando los dos en forma simult nea la idea fundamental es tener un frente m s para la promoci n de misiones con este cami n pensamos reforzar la promoci n en las ciudades de brasil en los tres estados linderos a la provincia
824985 el cami n nuevo atender a 35 personas en forma simult nea mientras que en el actual se atienden a 18 adem s es m s corto que el actual para que pueda tener un uso urbano y nos facilite participar en lugares donde actualmente no podemos ir por las dimensiones del embajador misionero el nuevo tiene diez metros de largo y se amplia una vez instalado se ensancha es m s corto y gil el actual lo utilizaremos para presencia en ferias y lugares donde hay grandes espacios al aire libre y este es m s pr ctico de modo que podr estar presente en lugares donde no pod amos llegar
824986 es necesario mejorar los ndices de engorde y reproducci n para poder aumentar as en n mero de cabezas que tenemos en misiones si apuntalamos los trabajos en esos puntos vamos a tener notables mejoras
824987 con cr ditos otorgados por el consejo federal de inversiones cfi podr n acondicionar los forrajes comprende adem s la implantaci n de pasturas y acondicionamiento de los que ya existen para que en el pr ximo invierno no les falte pasto al ganado

824993 es el preludio de un fuerte plan de inversiones en asfaltado urbano que va a llevar adelante el gobierno de la renovaci n en el a o 2009
824994 vamos a poner todo el empe o para culminar en 12 meses
824995 fue un compromiso de campa a de los pocos que hice
824996 para quienes hacemos pol tica desde muy j venes haber caminado por andresito haber entrado por las barrosas calles de tierra por el parque o por la obra infinita eterna casi que en alg n tiempo fue la ruta 19 y ver ahora c mo el progreso se pasea por sus calles c mo se llega ya no s lo por la 19 sino tambi n por la 101 si tocar un solo metro de barro adem s ver sus calles donde florece el comercio el trabajo el progreso ver a esos agricultores so ar desde tierra adentro con los productos tradicionales como la yerba o el tabaco o apostando al futuro con la ganader a y cualquiera de las alternativas de alimentos misioneros les puedo asegurar que llena el coraz n de alegr a y por sobre todas las cosas de reconocimiento a tantas familias que desde distintos lugares de nuestra provincia vinieron a esta la ltima colonizaci n misionera la ltima epopeya de misioneros y misioneras que vinieron a hacer este andresito
824997 el progreso viene de la mano del esfuerzo un esfuerzo que siempre me gusta decir debe ser un esfuerzo compartido un esfuerzo del gobierno provincial con el gobierno municipal con cada uno de los vecinos por eso hoy podemos no solamente inaugurar obras sino tambi n anunciar proyectos ideas y compromisos cada uno de los actos en un gobierno tiene algo de gestual para nosotros este acto es muy importante porque es el primer acto de inauguraci n de asfaltado urbano que hacemos en esta gesti n es el primero y por eso quer amos estar ac es quiz s una muestra de un plan ambicioso que est llevando adelante el presidente de vialidad provincial que lo vamos a llevar adelante pronto para que esto que significa calidad de vida llegue a todos los municipios de la provincia de misiones no es f cil porque as como los alimentos suben saben ustedes que hay una constante crisis energ tica y una cuadra de asfalto que se hac a hace dos o tres a os por 25 000 o 30 000 pesos hoy su costo es de entre 70 y 90 mil pesos seg n el ancho que tenga esa cuadra lo hicimos porque me dec a el intendente mauri si no hace ahora que est n las m quinas cerca que est la 101 culmin ndose cu ndo lo vamos a hacer y en definitiva tomamos esta decisi n que es el preludio de un fuerte plan de inversiones en asfaltado urbano que va a llevar adelante el gobierno de la renovaci n en el a o 2009
824998 en los d as de la campa a electoral transit bamos la 101 con n stor y ten a todav a mucho de tierra y de desv os de lugares con voladuras para hacer o voladuras hechas miraba el desaf o que ten a al otro d a de asumir el gobierno todav a est bamos trabajando con ese sue o de ganar esa elecci n d as pasados cuando culmin bamos el primer cuatrimestre de clases en irigoyen inaugurando una escuela como lo hacemos casi todas las semanas del a o yo estaba en iguaz y lo llamo a n stor y le pregunto por d nde llego m s r pido de iguaz a bernardo de irigoyen me voy por eldorado o me voy por la 101 y nos fuimos con l por la 101 una obra concluida pr cticamente concluida faltan peque as cosas una obra que recupera el norte oriental de la provincia una obra que es un emblema que arranca desde irigoyen y que junto a la ruta costera 2 recupera nuestra parte oriental y nos hermana con los queridos vecinos del brasil
824999 esto siempre hay que decirlo nuestros pa ses durante a os ten an pol ticas llevadas adelante en el palacio san mart n en buenos aires o en itamaraty con niveles de sospecha y de agresi n permanente gracias a dios hoy no pensamos que algo nos pueda separar desde el mercosur creemos que la uni n de los pueblos americanos que esta uni n es irreversible y por eso nosotros construimos puentes de vinculaci n hacia ustedes y ustedes hacia nosotros prueba de ello es que saben est en marcha una obra de una gran inversi n que es la ruta 24 que va a llegar a integraci n para que sigamos tendi ndonos la mano entre argentinos y brasile os y para que podamos darle a nuestros agricultores la accesibilidad y la conectividad que reci n mencionaba el presidente de vialidad
825000 es imposible que uno imagine una provincia toda de asfalto d as pasados escuchaba que misiones casi duplica la cantidad de kil metros de asfalto referida al n mero de habitantes en relaci n a otras provincias es imposible imaginar que todo va a ser asfalto y como nosotros creemos en un plan de desarrollo provincial organizado que por sobre todas las cosas el hombre y la mujer de la chacra se queden en la chacra acompa amos a los intendentes con el mantenimiento de los caminos terrados bruno me dec a como dicen muchos intendentes y l sabe que esto es cierto que a l le hac a falta una motoniveladora y hoy firmamos el nico convenio de una motoniveladora en toda la provincia tiene su explicaci n la cantidad de caminos terrados y la cantidad de agricultores que tiene el municipio de andresito ponemos nosotros la plata para esta compra pero que l la va a devolver con el recurso y los impuestos que paguen cada uno de ustedes nosotros con esos recursos le vamos a comprar una pala una retro o alguna otra motoniveladora a alg n otro municipio de la provincia
825001 d as pasados se hizo la apertura y la adjudicaci n del hospital de andresito vamos a poner todo el empe o para culminarlo en 12 meses por eso es bueno andar por la provincia salir conocerla y caminarla por m s que sea un s bado a la tarde tengan la certeza de que para m esto no es trabajo es diversi n es esparcimiento es amistad es recorrer la provincia es bueno porque le pregunto al intendente c mo va la obra y me dice todav a no empez entonces solamente estando en los pueblos uno puede saber las cosas que quedan pendientes de manera que ahora mismo har las llamadas correspondientes para que esa obra del hospital que fue un compromiso de campa a de los pocos que hice porque no cre a que hab a que ganar una elecci n con promesas imposibles de cumplir pero que esta s la hice ac una noche casi corrido por la lluvia lo vamos a cumplir y le vamos a dar toda la fuerza
825002 tambi n le preguntaba al intendente cu ntas viviendas rurales se van a hacer saben ustedes que las viviendas rurales son centrales en nuestra pol tica y me ha dicho 19 viviendas lo felicito se or intendente porque el gobierno provincial nunca podr a hacer tantas viviendas sin su acompa amiento nosotros ponemos los materiales algo de recursos pero son claramente las viviendas rurales ejemplos de esfuerzo compartido en las que la mano de obra la poner la familia la coordinaci n la log stica la pone la municipalidad y nosotros ponemos gran parte de los materiales con actitudes como sta generando inversiones en la chacra entreg ndole el t tulo de propiedad a quien se merece tenerlo estamos provocando el desarrollo que queremos de una provincia que pueda ser vivida de tierra adentro
825003 es central para misiones concientizarnos a todos del problema mundial que tiene la humanidad referido a la demanda creciente de alimentos en las tierras de ustedes est la oportunidad del desarrollo de la frutas de las verduras de las hortalizas del desarrollo de la ganader a tienen ac el mercado tienen a pocos kil metros los consumidores el gran potencial como es eldorado y como es puerto iguaz cada cent metro cuadrado de la chacra de andresito debe estar produciendo algo cada cent metro cuadrado debe darse a la producci n de alimentos debe significar ingresos para ustedes a nadie le vamos a decir que abandone sus productos tradicionales tenemos que seguir haciendo t yerba tabaco pero agregarle el desarrollo de alguna otra fuente de ingreso la piscicultura la avicultura la ganader a las frutas las verduras los huevos lo que sea producir en la peque a mediana o gran escala los alimentos que va a demandar el mundo misiones y andresito si nosotros no producimos vamos a tener que salir a comprar y cada vez nos va a costar m s caro producto de ello son estas entregas estos convenios firmados pero como dec a alex sabemos de la dificultad estructural que hace a os golpea a la familia yerbatera y nos hacemos los distra dos venimos y ponemos el producto de la recaudaci n en manos de las cooperativas y esta no es la primera entrega es como la tercera para ayudar a que lleguen recursos al agricultor misionero estamos trabajando de la mano de la presidenta de la naci n que nos va a permitir que la provincia de misiones sea el plan piloto de las pol ticas para la econom a agraria familia y ojal que tengamos xito y que estemos a la altura de las circunstancias en ese camino estamos trabajando muy fuerte en sancionar una ley que puede ser vital y estructural que es aumentar de manera considerable el fondo especial del tabaco tanto para el bolsillo del tabacalero como para las pol ticas activas del gobierno para el agro misionero todas estas oportunidades son las que estamos llevando adelante desde nuestra gesti n y desde el afecto y la comuni n que nos unen con el gobierno nacional

825021 we have been happily borne or perhaps have unhappily dragged our weary way down the long and crooked streets of our lives past all kinds of walls and fences made of rotting wood rammed earth brick concrete iron railings we have never given a thought to what lies behind them we have never tried to penetrate them with our vision or our understanding but there is where the gulag country begins right next to us two yards away from us in addition we have failed to notice an enormous number of closely fitted well disguised doors and gates in these fences all those gates were prepared for us every last one and all of a sudden the fateful gate swings quickly open and four white male hands unaccustomed to physical labour but nonetheless strong and tenacious grab us by the leg arm collar cap ear and drag us in like a sack and the gate behind us the gate to our past life is slammed shut once and for all
825022 power is a poison well known for thousands of years if only no one were ever to acquire material power over others but to the human being who has faith in some faith that holds dominion over all of us and who is therefore conscious of his own limitations power is not necessarily fatal for those however who are unaware of any higher sphere it is a deadly poison for them there is no antidote
825023 we have to condemn publicly the very idea that some people have the right to repress others
825024 it is going to be uncomfortable horrible to live in such a country
825025 sometimes though you got thinking and your spirits soared your sentence was running out there wasnt much thread left on the spool lord just to think of it walking free on your own two legs
825026 standing there to be counted through the gate of an evening back in camp after a whole day of buffeting wind freezing cold and an empty belly the zek longs for his ladleful of scalding hot watery evening soup as for rain in time of drought he could knock it back in a single gulp for the moment that ladleful means more to him than freedom more than his whole past life more than whatever life is left to him

825031 no this is different i know ill feel better in a few days
825032 yes please be aware that people deal with this every day
825033 no i dont want you to feel guilty about this
825034 this is the foundation the epa and the federal and state governments and the litigators in the courts to use to literally destroy our economy and life as we know it

825036 discriminatory and not narrowly tailored to address comcasts concern about network congestion
825037 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped address unknown return to sender
825038 or if they opened letters mailed to you decided that because the mail truck is full sometimes letters to you could wait and then hid both that they read your letters and delayed them unfortunately that is exactly what comcast was doing with their subscribers internet traffic
825039 we are gratified that the commission did not find any conduct by comcast that justified a fine and that the deadline established in the order is the same self imposed deadline that we announced four months ago
825040 on the other hand we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
825041 the fact is the fcc does not know what comcast did and did not do
825042 ironically todays decision may result in slow speeds for 95 per cent of internet users

825047 one of our entrees was lavender crusted swordfish which answered the question of what youd encounter in a loccitane store if it suddenly decided to sell a line of seafood right next to the candles the lavender presence was that sharp that disconcerting

825049 beijings air quality is probably not yet up to what the world will be expecting from an olympic hosting city
825050 pollution goes down into the lungs it can cause inflammation it can cause people who have asthma to get asthma episodes and so generally it is not very helpful to athletes
825051 this past year i wore a mask all the way up to the race and after the race to see if it would work and i felt perfectly normal perfectly fine
825052 so i definitely think it worked and thats my plan again for this year
825053 we are still optimistic that during the olympics we can reduce pollution well below our target thresholds
825054 we will not rule out the possibility of anwar being arrested and it looks like they are planning to charge him by monday
825055 they may arrest him in the next 48 hours it is aimed to prevent him from contesting in a by election
825056 there are thousands of criminal cases not properly investigated why pursue this with zeal and in an unjust way is it because i will participate in a by election
825057 you want me to withdraw no i will continue to pursue the change lets see if they want to charge me
825058 the internet is getting bigger and more disorganised every day
825059 weve developed new architecture and algorithms that can handle the exponential growth of the internet and organise results that reflect its enormous complexity
825060 size matters because many people use the internet to find information that is of interest to them even if its not popular
825061 maybe no one phones your grandmother much but if her friend from the old neighbourhood wants to get in touch shouldnt her number be in the book cuil lists all the numbers even the ones that arent called much because one day someone will need that number

825064 his scepticism prompted him to delve into the footnotes of the female brain to find out where the author had got her figures what he found was not an academic citation but a reference to a self help book as far as liberman could tell all these numbers were plucked from thin air in no case did anyone cite any actual research to back them up
825065 hey theresa i betcha you wouldnt get out and wade in that fountain
825066 while nothing can replace a personal experience in a national park we think our podcasts will enhance peoples trips or give them the opportunity to learn about a park that they cant visit
825067 whether people download them to portable devices or watch them on their computers these free electronic presentations give us another way to serve park enthusiasts of all ages
825068 our podcasts give people from every corner of the earth the chance to fall in love with yellowstone and become its stewards for the future
825069 just like the earlier version of nature notes our podcasts tell yosemites stories from the perspective of the people who work here
825070 i like the idea that weve brought this institution back to life and that we use new media to put a personal face on the national park service
825071 my favorite podcast about canyonlands national park is the one on potholes
825072 it was so interesting to learn that tiny creatures are living in a bunch of dirt
825073 they loved being the experts and teaching us their parents what they learned while we walked around the park
825074 its a blast when visitors hear my voice and recognize me from the podcast
825075 it tells me that we actually reach people and help them plan their hikes before they get here
825076 rather than having to watch the video at the permit station which is required more and more visitors have watched it online ahead of time
825077 i am a fighter pilot in iraq and it makes my day when i can take a hike in glacier even if its from behind my computer
825078 the virtual hikes are awesome for a classroom project i am doing with my 5th graders
825079 they are perhaps the next best thing to actually being there
825080 personally i dont think that people are going to give up on the real thing
825081 after learning about parks from our online resources people want to get outside and explore on their own
825082 i have climbed to thee by the path of pain
825083 its rubbish i dont know how many but there have been many thousands exposed its not even within the realms of reality its a token gestur you wouldnt have all these men 20 nautical miles from ground zero if it wasnt for some sort of purpose to see how they reacted

825090 aiyah working life is like that lah isnt this what you wanted
825091 perlu saya tekankan di sini bahawa mereka yang tidak bersetuju itu bukan kerana tidak mahu dsai datuk seri anwar ibrahim bertanding di kbb tetapi mereka khuatir akan berbangkit isu kronisma dalam pakatan rakyat nanti bila dsai dswa datuk seri wan azizah amp ni nurul izzah duduk dalam parlimen dalam keadaan itu ada pulak lim kit siang lim guan eng amp karpal singh gobind singh juga duduk dalam parlimen
825092 ini telahpun dimaklumi oleh dsai amp pimpinan pakatan rakyat malahan dsai dalam pidatonya di kulim menyatakan bersedia bertanding di kbb setelah mahkamah mengisytiharkan kbb kosong
825093 maka pimpinan pkr telah mengadakan mesyuarat tergempar dan memutuskan pilihanraya kecil perlu dibuat segera bagi mereka menunggu 19 ogos mungkin akan terlambat nanti sebab itulah keputusan dibuat mengosongkan kerusi permatang pauh serta merta untuk membolehkan pilihanraya kecil diadakan segera
825094 namun mereka kekal dengan keputusan tersebut walaupun saya sangat sedih namun tetap akur dengan keputusan pimpinan tersebut

825108 you can go to fm radio and hear a girl screaming arrhh stop it stop it you boys or you can go to commercial am radio and hear a bloke saying and thats my opinion but where do you hear two women of a certain age sitting and having a chat about life
825109 in terms of branding it says to the market that were just not a radio station were a media company that provides more than just traditional broadcasts
825110 the integration of broadcast with online has been amazing its extraordinary the number of callers we get to 2gb who are listening online on live streaming

825119 after a rapid assessment that was conducted on saturday 28 june many needs were identified ranging from food to non food items christian care was able to contribute by attending to most of the processes that were taking place on that day to mobilize the church ministers to be present and to provide psycho social support christian care also was able to contribute a few non food items on sunday june 29 christian care was asked to be responsible for the food sector for the idps taking over from zimbabwe red cross of which currently we are fully responsible for providing the food and preparation of the food

825124 the poorest the most vulnerable will have incredible needs as iowa struggles to recover in the long term
825125 our job is to help the community determine how it will recover and that includes how to handle unmet needs
825126 its important for the community to come together and figure out how cases of need will be addressed
825127 there are plenty of communities affected by this flood where needs will far outweigh what government assistance can fix

825169 being sikh we moved to malton because of its strong sikh community and because most of our relatives lived here
825170 the temple on airport road was where we went to pray
825171 high school was a wonderful experience for me in the days before wikipedia i decided do some research on the history of malton but when i searched the net for information there was nothing available i figured that if i may as well register the domain
825172 there are many streets here named after famous battles derry road for instance and war heroes
825173 malton also has very strong sikh italian carribian and more recently muslim communities
825174 its this diversity that sets it apart from other communities i remember how excited my aunt was when she came to canada for the first time i picked her up downtown and she was so happy to see a man with a turban when we got to malton on the way home from the go station she must have seen at least 20 more sardars sikh men she had no idea how much of a sikh community really was present in malton when she moved to the states she was in a community in upstate new york where there were absolutely no minorities and was so happy to be a regular here rather than a very visible minority
825175 the italians have started to move to woodbridge and maple and indians are starting to move to brampton specifically springdale affectionally known as
825176 house prices have gone up since we moved in houses are being demolished and new huge homes put in their place people figure if they have to pay 500 000 to get a house in brampton may as well demolish a house in malton build a huge one in its place for the same price you get tax credits you look like a king and you stay in a really good neighbourhood close to airport jobs automotive jobs and highways 427 407 and 401

825178 if my best friend who lives on a farm is playing in the field and a tractor runs over him and kills him that would be a tragedy
825179 if a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff killing everyone inside that would be a tragedy
825180 isnt there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy
825181 thats right and can you tell me why that would be tragedy
825182 it has to be a tragedy because it certainly wouldnt be a great loss and it probably wouldnt be an accident either
825183 i dont think rural is as accurate as the word countryside
825184 there are seventeen communities in caledon and each one of these has a very distinct local character a unique style from palgrave and its rolling hills and the forks of the credit with its escarpment cliffs and ski lodges
825185 a word ive heard to describe some of the communities of caledon like caledon east is rurban
825186 i think of the countryside communities as rurban because you have a distinct rural flavour and mindset but still have services at your fingertips
825187 and palgrave is more rural i cant walk to my services in palgrave i have to get in the car i was raised in the country and a country mile means something different than in the city there is a new subdivision in caledon east there is a regional senior centre there you can walk to your grocery store or your local deli in caledon east you could get out of your car and live in that community
825188 the southern boundary is getting more urban thanks to our proximity to brampton
825189 caledon east is one of the designated urban boundaries in caledon and is a part of the greenbelt and is therefore protected under provincial policy and then you have bolton which is quite an urban core housing 46 of the population thats your subdivision area if you like to have neighbours and be very connected that way thats a place to go
825190 the countryside feel is a part of the community of caledon and people moving here are buying into that life
825191 caledon is about small towns and i think caledon east will be able to remain a small town for a very long time
825192 ive lived here in mono road all my life i met my husband here and my children all go to school here i love the people i love the small town mentality
825193 when youre young you just grab a job and you work
825194 and it got to the point where i was here more often than i was home
825195 twenty years have gone by so fast that i dont realize that weve been in business for twenty years
825196 you just get busy with life i should appreciate what i have a little more but when you get in the grind and working you just take it for granted
825197 when people get off the plane and go into toronto theyll see nice restaurants and some world class hotels its a very welcoming street its easy to access and very straightforward and we keep it clean and tidy its important because its the first impression of toronto for a lot of people
825198 the section between skyway attwell and carlingview has a very parkish feel
825199 first of all theres the royal woodbine golf course interestingly hidden down below as you drive by it on dixon then as you end up in front of the constellation hotel area youll find that the grass median not only has far more plant life than a normal median but it has integrated sprinklers that run on timers for most of the summer
825200 finally theres the large lawnspace at the streetfront of the regal constellation hotel itself
825201 the trees in that area were planted by the hotel gardener herbert mageira if you hunt carefully between the trees on the property you will find a plaque honouring herbert which was placed there by the hotel owners when he passed away in 1984
825202 we had a particular interest in the one area that was no longer open to the public
825203 the hotel announced its closure on the weekend of our 2003 convention and at the end of the weekend we decided that we didnt want to say goodbye to the building without at least one attempt to find our way into that tower
825204 we started exploring back hallways and stairwells to see if we could find our way in
825205 we did find a set of elevators for that tower in a lower basement but they required a key to activate and the accompanying stairwell was cemented to prevent access
825206 alex hacker contacted me providing me with info on the history and evolution of the area
825207 he told me that the hotel was the first one on the strip that it was named
825208 for several years in the 1960s the hotel was known as the only place to eat between toronto and brampton
825209 in its prime the hotel was the choice of several celebrities and even some notable prime ministers alex hacker had photos of diefenbaker and the trudeaus at the hotel
825210 im pleased to say that i was able to purchase the wall of memories as well as piles of other memorabilia from the hotel room keys valet uniforms promotional documents from over the years and so on
825211 theres piles and piles of the stuff in my basement now
825212 and i can tell you that the plaque honouring herbert mageira was removed before demolition began and through pretty much sheer luck i was able to obtain it shortly thereafter
825213 its pretty weather beaten but still mostly readable and if the new hotel owners are uninterested in replacing it when the construction of the new hotel is complete we will most likely return it to alex hacker who placed it there in 1984
825214 the world is covered by a sole city which does not begin and does not end
825215 the afternoon is the best time to watch planes here

825223 i swear some city folk see you like that they may as well pose next to you for photographs
825224 hmm itll be a ten wheeler white with a grain logo and it wont stop
825225 i told you no points for that no one stops at this place you dont deserve an extra point for that

825232 they take in the hills and the valleys and the rivers our fall tours are quite spectacular but you shouldnt forget spring where we have a thousand shades of green
825233 i was drawn here because i wanted to build a house and land here was affordable what keeps me in mono is the countryside and the nature weve been able to preserve the pristine streams the open vistas its one of the nicest pieces of country around
825234 mono cliffs with its scenic caves and crevices and hockley valley we also have a lovely golf course spa and resort at hockley valley and a conference centre and hotel at hockley highlands we have a number of historical towns and restaurants at hockley village the globe hotel in rosemount which is a restaurant and not a hotel we have a group of businesses in violet hill near mulmur the schoolhouse restaurant then in mono centre we have a lovely historic restaurant
825235 the mono road was a favourite route for bringing goods from mono and orangeville down to toronto
825236 my grandfather told me that his father would slaughter his hogs in winter and let them freeze using a team of horses to take the hog carcasses down the mono road
825237 i grew up a few blocks from the foot of sixth line
825238 we used to ride our bikes there and i recall the signs reading
825239 we need to execute people like john walker in order to physically intimidate liberals by making them realize that they can be killed too
825240 i tell people dont kill all the liberals leave enough so we can have two on every campus living fossils so we will never forget what these people stood for
825241 were going to keep building the party until were hunting democrats with dogs
825242 you shouldnt be allowed to express that opinion you moron
825243 most of the conditions of the communist manifesto have been implemented in canada and the united states wake up people
825244 no we shouldn t tar you or all conservative party supporters in connection to the rhetoric of coulter but as i said these radical elements in the conservative movement seem to believe that they re welcome where they are

825279 my husband and i were thinking about sending a letter out to our families stating simply that we are not participating in the traditional gift giving this year
825280 we tried to send a letter asking everyone to do a drawing and set a limit on the amount spent unfortunately it was not well received so i have simply bought less and less over the past few years i think everyone needed time to accept our position i simply changed how i gave gifts

825390 moose a memoir of fat camp is a coming of age story detailing the dramas of a chubby adolescence complete with teen aged diary excerpts klein takes readers on a condensed journey of her time spent at a fat camp her struggles with a weight loss support group and the unforgiving mockery of her peers composed in a very juno esque narrative style quirky attempts at wit and humor laced with sarcasm kleins memoir is quickly paced but lacks development while honest discussions about body image self esteem and family dynamics do occur they are cursory at best readers are left wondering why klein delves into certain topics yet neglects to explain their relevance or importance including her relationship with her sister as well as her budding sexuality although kleins memoir is jumpy and somewhat repetitive there are a number of passages that truly illustrate her strengths as both a writer and a woman however its tough to struggle through the rest of the book to pick out the gems

825449 the consequences of continued congressional inaction on gas prices are unacceptable weve called on the speaker to call congress back into an emergency session this month and schedule a vote on the american energy act we must continue to make a stand until the speaker complies
825450 we realize not everyone can be in washington next week but if you can be we ask that you come to the capitol join our colleagues and lend your voice beginning this monday at 10 00 am
825451 if you cant be in washington we ask that you contribute to the cause in other ways such as spreading the word among your constituents writing an op ed for your local newspaper or taking our all of the above energy message to your local airwaves
825452 republicans stand with the american people we share their passion and determination for energy independence and weve pledged to fight boldly until congress heeds their will

825455 i havent really done any things this summer because ive had to do too much stuff
825456 i think since we had all that lousy weather in the spring we didnt get all the stuff wed normally do done in the spring and its bled over to summer
825457 this isnt a trend it is usually done in cases of emergency if anything
825458 an isolated case determined by an emergency it works for roma because they have other players who give depth on the field
825459 totti is physically and technically so good he can do anything however with a midfield of seedorf pirlo and gattuso for example totti could never play as a central attacker
825460 cristiano and messi are number 7s they are external attackers who have adapted
825461 ronaldinho would make a better trequartista in a 4 2 3 1 3 4 2 1 or an outside attacker in a 4 3 3 but as a centre forward no

825470 mancini won a lot with us now mourinho has come and he is smart and very technically capable he makes his concepts clear to the team we are working hard to get results in the best possible way you can already see his mourinhos hand at work
825471 we hope that success in the champions league is possible with all the efforts of the president and club
825472 inter president massimo moratti deserves such an important success after all hes done to make inter a strong side he would be the happiest if we won it
825473 i think the other teams have been reinforced but we will fight to reach our goals with everything at out disposal
825474 ac milan made an important purchase in ronaldinho as he is a champion who can change a match at any time
825475 then there is us who want to defend the scudetto at all costs the championship will be both balanced and beautiful
825476 in those meetings if he wants to keep the player hell do everything he can to do so and hell probably succeed as well
825477 what he is doing is in the interests of manchester united thats what he always thinks of
825478 oh i read it in the not so smarty pants sounding readers digest
825479 the deer is just sleeping in the middle of the road
825480 i think it was important for anelka but more important for us for the fans and for me the coach to have more confidence for this player
825481 hes one of the players that we need this season i was happy today not because he scored four goals but he played with more quality and freedom than in the other games thats important for us because that was our last training match and against a big club like milan
825482 its fantastic for anelkas confidence to score four times against milan
825483 he believes more and the other players believe in him more
825484 at 69 years old he probably cant see past the stage you better be in the front row

825498 sesungguhnya allah menahan langit dan bumi supaya jangan bergeser dan sungguh jika keduanya bergeser tidak ada seorangpun yang dapat menahan keduanya selain allah
825499 penyebab pastinya sering kali tidak jelas tapi pemicu terbesar adalah kebersihan mulut yang tidak terjaga
825500 tubuh yang tidak fit atau rendahnya imunitas seseorang membuat dia mudah terserang seriawan infeksi dan kelainan dalam pencernaan manifestasinya bisa ke rongga mulut misalkan jika usus atau lambung bermasalah bisa saja timbul seriawan
825501 kemungkinan hal itu disebabkan ada infeksi pada saluran pencernaan dan akibatnya menjadi panas karena itu secara umum orang menyebutnya panas dalam
825502 kalau sekiranya dikarenakan stres maka upayakan untuk memanajemen emosi dengan baik sehingga stresnya bisa hilang dan seriawan pun akan sembuh intinya kenali dulu faktor penyebab atau pemicunya sehingga bisa menentukan jenis dan langkah pengobatan yang tepat
825503 rasanya mungkin sangat perih tapi tidak apa apa biar cepat sembuh
825504 keguguran jadi saya ini hamil dok berapa bulan kok saya tak merasa kalau saya hamil
825505 misalnya pada orang orang yang mendapat haid 3 bulan sekali atau bahkan 4 bulan sekali jadi saat haidnya berhenti ia tak menyadari bahwa itu suatu kehamilan dikiranya haidnya terlambat seperti biasanya
825506 lupa minum pil atau terlambat datang untuk suntik misalnya seharusnya tanggal 10 datang untuk suntik tapi baru tanggal 13 ia datang nah kalau pada hari hari alpa ia berhubungan seks maka bisa saja terjadi kehamilan
825507 nah kalau ia tiba tiba tak memakai kb maka hormonnya sempat turun kalau ia berhubungan saat keseimbangan hormonnya tak karuan maka bisa terjadi kehamilan
825508 berfungsi bagus bila ibu dalam keadaan sehat kalau sedang diare atau mengalami gangguan pencernaan bisa saja mempengaruhi penyerapan pil kontrasepsi itu nah di situ bisa terjadi kehamilan
825509 obat obatan golongan tetrasiklin bisa membuat efektivitas dari kontrasepsi menurun selain itu golongan obat analgetik juga berdampak sama pokoknya hati hati pada obat obatan yang dimakan setelah kita makan nasi
825510 sebab seringkali si ibu tetap merasa safe karena dirinya telah ber kb ternyata bisa jebol juga
825511 terkadang si ibu tak menyadari kalau spiralnya lepas misalnya saat haid sedang banyak bisa saja spriral keluar tanpa disadarinya
825512 apalagi bagi ibu yang anaknya sudah banyak biasanya kan ukuran mulut rahimnya melebar sehingga iud bisa lepas tanpa disadari
825513 mereka punya kecenderungan seperti ini ditambah lagi kalau ada perubahan ovulasi dari wanita tersebut misalnya karena stres atau tekanan kerja yang meningkat sehingga ovulasi bisa lebih cepat atau terlambat mungkin dipikirnya saat ini tak ovulasi sehingga ia pun berhubungan seks ternyata justru salah perhitungan sehingga bisa terjadi kehamilan
825514 baru setelah berusia 5 bulan si ibu bisa merasakan gerakan si bayi di perutnya
825515 misalnya ia bisa merasakan perubahan payudaranya yang terasa tegang sakit serta membesar
825516 yang tak bisa dielakkan pula dari wanita berbadan dua adalah si ibu akan merasakan frekuensi kencingnya lebih meningkat
825517 hanya wanita yang benar benar tidak care pada tubuhnya yang sampai lolos dengan perubahan ini
825518 sesudah itu tak mungkin jika ia sampai tak merasakan karena payudara dan perut akan semakin membesar janin juga sudah mulai bergerak serta frekuensi keinginan untuk kencing juga semakin meningkat
825519 nah kesibukan yang tinggi bisa membuatnya sering telat makan ditambah lagi tingkat stresnya yang tinggi sehingga bisa saja oksigenisasi ke janin jadi terganggu
825520 nikotin dan karbon monoksida juga membuat gangguan penyerapan di tempat calon ari arinya sehingga kemampuan penyerapan dari sel sel membran di plasenta terganggu dengan demikian aliran makanan ke bayi juga terganggu
825521 padahal orang hamil kan harus mengkonsumsi gizi cukup makan vitamin minum susu hidup teratur nah kalau ia sibuk terus dan tak memperhatikan kehamilannya bisa mengakibatkan pertumbuhan janin terhambat kan
825522 akibatnya oksigenisasi ke janin juga terhambat bayi bisa mengecil dan meninggal di dalam kandungan
825523 hal ini bisa mengakibatkan gangguan kromosom misalnya mutasi gen pada janin bila terjadi pada kromosom 21 mungkin saja akan muncul sindroma down
825524 padahal pada obat obatan batuk pilek yang mengandung antihistamin bisa membawa dampak terjadinya bibir sumbing pada si janin
825525 kendati tidak ada persiapan khusus asalkan ibu tetap menjaga kebutuhan tubuhnya istirahat juga cukup ia tak mengkonsumsi obat obatan yang dapat mengganggu kesehatan janinnya sehinga kebutuhan janin tetap tercukupi
825526 dari situ akan ketahuan apakah janinnya berada dalam pertumbuhan yang baik atau tidak kalau ingin mengetahui kemungkinan apakah janinnya cacat atau tidak perlu dilakukan pemeriksaan alpha betha protein dari darah janin atau air ketuban
825527 jadi tak ada pemeriksaan khusus untuk mengejar ketinggalan sebab perawatan kehamilan bukan merupakan pertambahan matematis bila kekurangan selama 3 bulan bisa diburu dengan segala macam terapi untuk bisa mengimbanginya

825531 these new figures should bring new focus to our efforts to address aids and hiv here at home
825532 combating hiv aids also demands closing the gaps in opportunity that exist in our society so that we can strengthen our public health we must also overcome the stigma that surrounds hiv aids a stigma that is too often tied to homophobia
825533 we need to encourage folks to get tested and accelerate hiv aids research toward an effective cure because we have a moral obligation to join together to meet this challenge and to do so with the urgency this epidemic demands
825534 work closely with non profit government and private sector stakeholders to continue the fight against hiv aids
825535 by focusing efforts on reducing drug costs through greater market competition promoting prevention efforts encouraging testing targeting communities with high infection rates strengthening research and reducing disparities through effective public outreach we as a nation can make great progress in fighting hiv aids
825536 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the us hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease
825537 we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programs we know are effective

825567 its a problem for the club for sporting director pedja mijatovic and the coach
825568 but now wesley sneijder is injured and hes an important player for us maybe tomorrow there will be a meeting with the people in the club and maybe then theres going to be news about this
825569 we know cristiano ronaldo is an incredible player and we dont have any problem with him joining us
825570 real madrid making an offer is normal manchester united and coach sir alex ferguson dont want this because he is a very important player at united and that is normal too
825571 i think theyre going to have to talk about this and if cristiano ronaldo is coming to real madrid the dressing room is waiting for him
825572 if he came of course the players and the fans would be excited the supporters are used to watching the best players in the world at the bernabeu and cristiano ronaldo is one of the best players in the world
825573 i feel the best of real madrid is the squad and the dressing room and if cristiano is coming here we dont have room for him in the team
825574 but as i said before maybe with the injury to wesley sneijder maybe we need someone else

825582 citylife 08 a downtown sculpture walk by j seward johnson
825583 it encourages people to stop and look around and to use their eyes in a conscious way
825584 they make people think what comes next it opens them up to things that are a little more challenging and indigenous to our culture here in dayton
825585 i have seen so many people come downtown to look at the sculptures and then they stop in at our gallery for the first time
825586 the next thing you know theyll be into mixed media abstract conceptual installations
825587 i would see someone from far away and assume it was one of those sculptures and then they would get up and move away it was freaky and interesting
825588 just 18 months after abandoning his vivacious second wife caroline for an american tv presenter 44 year old earl spencer is single again
825589 i can reveal he has dumped coleen sullivan who moved in with princess dianas brother soon after being sent to britain to interview him the break up has stunned friends who thought that the libidinous earl had at last found the third countess spencer
825590 their relationship has certainly followed a predictable pattern he fell so passionately for the dark haired coleen that he left caroline just months after she had given birth to their daughter lara their second child and his sixth but the couple are no longer living together at his magnificent stately home althorp in northamptonshire where diana is buried
825591 coleen was not seen at last weeks literary festival at althorp which spencer takes a great pride in
825592 she has gone home to america what else do you expect a girl to do
825593 the only difference between this and his previous break ups is that at least he wont have to pay out a divorce settlement
825594 she has gone home to america what else do you expect a girl to do

825948 knowing that he was going off to be interviewed on television later
825949 putting a stop to the huge flows of money into tax havens
825950 tax evasion and corruption are believed to cost poor countries at least 50 billion dollars a year
825951 to avoid paying taxes to their home countries as well as for those that want to hide away money gained through corruption
825952 for every dollar invested in development projects in poor countries the countries lose ten dollars to the tax havens
825953 the moral of the story is that leftist politicians are in favor of anything that gives them more money that enables them to buy votes and provide unearned wealth to their supporters but taxpayers the ones who generate the wealth should not be allowed to protect themselves and their families by utilizing jurisdictions with better tax law
825954 it is spoken by a man who has been shipwrecked and finds himself seeking shelter beside a sleeping monster
825955 the conservatives have brought their own building blocks to the construction of the police state while dismantling nothing of what the liberals had built before them
825956 in general it can probably be said that the conservative does not object to coercion or arbitrary power so long as it is used for what he regards as the right purposes he believes that if government is in the hands of decent men it ought not be too much restricted by rigid rules since he is essentially opportunist and lacks principles his main hope must be that the wise and the good will rule not merely by example as we all must wish but by authority given to them and enforced by them like the socialist he is less concerned with the problem of how the powers of government should be limited than with that of who should wield them and like the socialist he regards himself as entitled to force the value he holds on other people
825957 only legal sources of income is not under audit or investigation and whose noncompliance is not likely to be imminently discovered

825960 weve got a lot of recognition as a being a very good financial center but we are still being lumped in with areas that maybe are not so good
825961 offshore finance centers ofcs like the bahamas are seeking to shed their image as places wealthy individuals use to evade taxes and according to some the change in image is succeeding its a trend marked by jurisdictions promoting themselves as well regulated and transparent whereas the image of the ofc used to be almost exclusively tied to impregnable bank secrecy laws and regimes
825962 the agency charged with stopping them the los angeles county department of public health visited repeatedly saw rats through the windows of the sisters home and did virtually nothing to end the threat to the public the neighbors or the sisters themselves nor did the office of city attorney rocky delgadillo act without weeks of foot dragging and buck passing

825966 one of the most likely places shady tax transactions could be sheltered if american companies are setting up shop at the beach just to avoid their tax obligations we cant keep our heads in the sand we must make sure honest american taxpayers are not footing the bill for corporations that arent paying their fair share
825967 find legislative solutions to pressure the irs and better enable them to collect on the nearly 345 billion annually of legally owed but unpaid taxes
825968 it is important to understand that the structures are mere pieces of paper with no commercial reality
825969 offshore tax evasion is a massive threat to the u s tax system
825970 it can be actually beneficial to tax mobile capital less than immobile capital otherwise the mobile capital will just go elsewhere i would imagine that the presence of tax havens may well cost tax revenue but that does not necessarily mean it is bad to have them around
825971 tax havens can also facilitate investment by allowing investors to reduce their tax burdens
825972 the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants it is its natural manure
825973 lord to whom shall we go you have the words of eternal life 69 we believe and know that you are the holy one of god
825974 lord we dont know where you are going so how can we know the way

825979 tax havens are engaged in economic warfare against the united states and honest hardworking american taxpayers
825980 the practice of making unfair allegations or using unfair investigative techniques in many instances unsupported by proof or based on slight doubtful or irrelevant evidence
825981 ordinary americans pick up the slack for tax cheats who hide assets in offshore tax havens often with the help of foreign banks like ubs and lgt
825982 tax havens are engaged in economic warfare against the united states and honest hardworking american taxpayers
825983 the death of offshore secrecy and its not resting in peace
825984 no individual should take any comfort in relying on any countrys so called bank secrecy laws
825985 this is a direct and coordinated attack on the heart of the swiss financial system this is a long term threat that will not go away and there is not too much switzerland can do
825986 is to get a clear line of sight into the owners of the bank account and to know where theres fraud
825987 what i can say is that theres no doubt that our u s troops have contributed to a reduction in violence in iraq i said that not just today not just yesterday but ive said that previously
825988 we cannot impose a military solution on what has effectively become a civil war and until we acknowledge that reality we can send 15 000 more troops 20 000 more troops 30 000 more troops i dont know any expert on the region or any military officer that ive spoken to privately that believes that that is going to make a substantial difference on the situation on the ground
825989 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
825990 well actually i think there was a very serious debate and its based on some fundamental differences i think reasonable people can differ on this issue because there are no good options in iraq we should not have gone at this point we have bad options and worse options but we are facing a choice my assessment is that the surge has not worked and we will not see a different report eight weeks from now
825991 finally in 2006 2007 we started to see that even after an election george bush continued to want to pursue a course that didnt withdraw troops from iraq but actually doubled them and initiated a search and at that stage i said very clearly not only have we not seen improvements but were actually worsening potentially a situation there
825992 now i had no doubt and i said at the time when i opposed the surge that given how wonderfully our troops perform if we place 30 000 more troops in there then we would see an improvement in the security situation and we would see a reduction in the violence
825993 senator obama in the same vein you were also opposed to the surge from the beginning were you wrong
825994 well i think it is indisputable that weve seen violence reduced in iraq and thats a credit to our brave men and women in uniform
825995 we dont need more spin about how the surge is succeeding in doing what it was supposed to do which is to get the iraqis to stand up and take responsibility for their own future so we can start sending our troops home
825996 more than 20 000 extra u s troops into iraq felt to many critics including sen barack obama like doubling down on failure
825997 david mendell has covered obama since the beginning of his campaign for
825998 mendell also positions barack obama as in fact the savior of a fumbling democratic party
825999 after sen barack obamas meeting today in ramallah with president mahmoud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad at the mukata the presidents compound states that obama corrected his statements on supporting an undivided jerusalem
826000 that the future of the city can be resolved through peace negotiations between israel and the palestinians
826001 jerusalem will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
826002 the united states cannot dictate the terms of a final status agreement we should support the parties as they negotiate these difficult issues but they will have to reach agreements that they can live with in general terms clearly israel must emerge in a final status agreement with secure borders jerusalem will remain israels capital and no one should want or expect it to be re divided
826003 i want to ask you about something you said in aipac yesterday you said that jerusalem must remain undivided do palestinians have no claim to jerusalem in the future
826004 well obviously its going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues
826005 this is a press the networks especially that have gone into a complete swoon over barack obama
826006 you know when you have the network anchors chasing your opponent across the middle east its a little hard to make news what is your strategy to get folks to pay attention to your message over the next couple of days
826007 he was quoted accurately he did express a clear affinity for obamas 16 month proposal
826008 but one of the other things that one of the other things that he obama has said is that maybe the troops should be out within the next 18 months an idea that prime minister al maliki basically agrees with maybe the surge in fact did work is it time for american troops to start coming home
826009 we are winning the war and senator obama was wrong he railed against it he voted against the surge and he said it would fail he was wrong there
826010 a quick question about the press coverage if i can
826011 youre laughing do you think the press coverage is unfair
826012 thats up to the american people to decide diane it is what it is
826013 you have criticized senator obama in the past for not going to iraq and getting a fresh assessment he is in iraq as we speak this morning does this take care of it
826014 he went to iraq will you leave him alone now
826015 you know when you have the network anchors chasing your opponent across the middle east its a little hard to make news what is your strategy to get folks to pay attention to your message over the next couple of days
826016 he was quoted accurately he did express a clear affinity for obamas 16 month proposal
826017 but one of the other things that one of the other things that he obama has said is that maybe the troops should be out within the next 18 months an idea that prime minister al maliki basically agrees with maybe the surge in fact did work is it time for american troops to start coming home
826018 we are winning the war and senator obama was wrong he railed against it he voted against the surge and he said it would fail he was wrong there
826019 what does this tell us regarding our media and what fills the eyes ears and hearts of our american population let me fill you in in communist nations their populations hear and see what has been decided they hear and see in dictatorships which claim some semblance of democracy by allowing elections they are often biased allowing little to no input as members of a nation cast their ballot
826020 a lantern of courage and faith that illuminated the way home with honor
826021 i have made far too many mistakes in my own life to forever disparage people
826022 now that im back i find a lot of hand wringing about this country i dont buy that i think america today is a better country than the one i left nearly six years ago
826023 apparently the vast majority of corporations which own the media have decided they want barack obama to be our next president regardless of whether thats whats best for america campaign donations from citizens who are members of the mainstream media are 100 1 in favor of democrats on the other side of corporate messaging we have mostly neoconservatives neither of those statements makes me comfortable like i said we the people are responsible for our government not the other way around we have a right to vote but in the past most of us literally havent even bothered exercising that right in addition to being a right it is also a responsibility change with no discernable valid constitutional standing is a dangerous threat to our democracy thats as simply as i can state my opinion why have so many men and women died to protect our self evident rights what is your responsibility is it going to be good enough for you to just simply vote your own conscious while remaining silent about whats important
826024 were i to sum up the basle congress in a word which i shall guard against pronouncing publicly it would be this basle i founded the jewish state if i said this out loud today i would be answered by universal laughter if not in 5 years certainly in 50 everyone will know it
826025 it appears that he believes that cheering crowds on foreign soil will have some measurable impact for his candidacy he realizes the images of large crowds gathered to hear him will be beamed to our televisions tonight and prominently positioned on tomorrows newspapers he realized these things long before he left on his trip and the purpose would seem intentional rather than speak directly to the people of our country he appeals to foreigners to cheer him so he may have their help in influencing our population
826026 out of respect for these servicemen and women that it would be inappropriate to make a stop to visit troops at a u s military facility as part of a trip funded by the campaign
826027 let me say something about the message management he didnt have reporters with him he didnt have a press pool he didnt do a press conference
826028 what some would call fake interviews because they are not interviews from a journalist
826029 americans are beginning to notice obamas elevated opinion of himself
826030 procedures that will be performed include ureteral dissection pelvic and para aortic lymphadenectomy repair of simulated bowel and bladder injury bowel resection ureteral re anasomosis and liver resection
826031 toyota has taken over the past commands the present and is leading the way to a brighter future in which cars are powered by unconventional means it is fathering the technology that will save the industry and america from slavish dependence on petroleum and reliance on resources from unstable parts of the world
826032 america is going to meet this great challenge but we are not going to do it as a supplicant or as a plaintiff we are not going to meet it with words at all we are going to meet it with action and we are going to meet this challenge in a way consistent with the character of our nation
826033 ecclesiastes 1 18 for in much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow
826034 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse i think it takes pressure off the iraqis to arrive at the sort of political accommodation that every observer believes is the ultimate solution to the problems we face there and the problem is the iraqis i think take that message to mean that no matter how little they are compromising with each other americans are still going to be present as long as we are not willing to provide any consequences to failure for them to arrive at a political compromise were going to continue to see the sort of sectarian bloodshed thats been evident over the last several months
826035 we can safely redeploys our combat brigades at a pace that would remove them in 16 months
826036 a phased withdrawal with benchmarks for the iraqi government to meet that called for strategic pauses based on the progress on these benchmarks and advice on the commanders on the ground
826037 syahadat adalah kesaksian yang menyadarkan dengan tuntas bahwa tidak ada ilah selain allah sasaran yang dituju oleh kesaksian ini pertama tama adalah diri kita sedangkan objek di luar kita adalah nomor dua
826038 ya kita harus bertekad pertama tidak akan meng ilah kan diri kita kita sering lupa lebih banyak potensi berhala berada dalam diri kita daripada di luarnya
826039 ya peng ilah an atau pemberhalaan diri sadar atau tidak sering kita lakukan bentuknya bisa macam macam tapi dasarnya adalah egosentrisme bahwa diri dan kepentingan diri dijadikan pusat sekaligus orientasi kehidupan maka diri dianggap subjek paling penting alangkah mudah kita merasa lebih penting daripada orang lain terutama terhadap mereka yang miskin kamu akan merasa dirimu lebih penting lebih berharga daripada misalnya seorang gelandangan yang melintas di hadapanmu iya
826040 dan kamu pasti tidak merasa bahwa itu adalah bentuk peng ilah an diri yang paling umum dilakukan padahal itu merupakan pelanggaran terhadap makna syahadat ingatlah kanjeng nabi mau minum dari cawan yang baru dipakai oleh bilal beliau juga hanya tertawa tawa ketika dikencingi oleh anak gelandangan badui yang dibopongnya dengan penuh kasih sayang mengapa karena kanjeng nabi tidak merasa lebih penting dari siapapun
826041 nah sekarang kamu ingin bisa mencintai orang lain dengan tulus
826042 sayangnya setan memang telah sukses membangun egosentrisme di hati manusia tak terkecuali kita yang sudah mengucap syahadat padahal egosentrisme merupakan bentuk halus peng ilah an diri yang menghambat pengembangan sikap dan rasa kasih sayang terhadap sesama dan kata kanjeng nabi sendiri tanpa kemampuan mengembangkan kasih sayang sama dengan ketiadaan iman dalam diri kita dan islam sebagai rahmatan lil alamin tidak bakal terwujud
826043 jangalah engkau memberi tetapi berharap sesuatu yang lebih banyak ironisnya sudah tidak ikhlas dan tidak tulus masih pula saling menyalahkan
826044 amalnya tak lagi memberi ruang bagi lahirnya pujian atau cercaan

826072 an indulgence will shorten your time in purgatory by a fixed number of days
826073 the number of days which used to be attached to indulgences were references to the period of penance one might undergo during life on earth the catholic church does not claim to know anything about how long or short purgatory is in general much less in a specific persons case

826083 im giving the maximum donation to obama then it might have been hypocritical this wasnt an announcement it was a reporter doing his job and kpd i think you are simply looking for an argument if you believe that article was in any way slanted towards either of the candidates

826119 this means that the only thing standing between the american people and these vast oil reserves is action from the u s congress
826120 in the long run the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies my administration has worked with congress to invest in gas saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells in the short run the american economy will continue to rely largely on oil and that means we need to increase supply especially here at home so my administration has repeatedly called on congress to expand domestic oil production

826154 india is a storehouse of talent and there is a huge demand for indian medical professionals in the us as well as the global health sector so we are expanding our presence in india to tap its latent talent
826155 perhaps the fact that the philippines is the second largest exporter of medical talent to the us is making it a hot destination for medical students
826156 for applying to colleges in russia or china its mandatory to know the local language but here there is no such compulsion

826818 the trend was even more apparent in the second hand market which saw a drop of about 7 per cent in price for bmw sedans and its comparable middle price series

827149 its not really i just need to inform you that across the mountain theres a bright stationary object
827150 if youve got a couple of minutes perhaps you could find out what it is its been there at least half an hour and its still there

827182 time travel tours into hannibals past see hannibal during its industrial age period of working class prosperity
827183 i thought time machines were scientifically impossible how is it that you have one
827184 this is new cutting edge technology i was lucky enough to obtain the one hannibal area license for this machine from the federal bureau of time management as the technology is new the btm only allows one such license to be issued in each tourist area
827185 can you guarantee that youll be able to bring us back to the present
827186 as long as you stick with me and dont wander off i can assure you that ill bring you back to the present time we are only allotted one hour in the past
827187 today folks were headed back to the apex of hannibals commercial and industrial era circa 1925 shoes lumber and lime provided jobs for many hannibalians back then
827188 down below you can see the enormous shoe factory complex
827189 closer to the river notice the sawmills and planing mills in these establishments lumber is being processed from logs floated down the mississippi from minnesota and wisconsin towards your right on the south side of town you can see signs of dusty activity near the top of a ridge if you listen closely you will be able to hear the rumbly sounds of limestone being ground the cooked and ground stone will be shipped out of the quarry in wooden casks ultimately to be used as plaster and mortar in a multitude of developing midwestern towns and cities
827190 it looks like i calibrated our temporal destination just right folks see that farmstead right on the banks of the mississippi thats judge e t camerons place and if you look closely you can see the judges son archie driving a herd of cattle westwards into the hills and valleys of the familys property see that plume of steam gushing from a hillside thats relatively warm humid air condensing in the chill air as it streams from from a cave sytem that no one has ever explored archie told his father of his discovery and the pair eventually pick axed the opening making it wider and ventured into the cave
827191 if you are willing to shell out seventeen bucks you can take a tour of the cave that archie cameron discovered eighty three years ago is it worth the money i admit that you wont see the sort of spectacular cave formations visible in the various ozark tourist caves but cameron cave has a charm of its own there is almost no graffiti and a visit to the cave is an opportunity to visit one of those rarest of midwestern localities a place which has been little visited by people the cave has been open to the public for only thirty years and it could be considered to be a pristine environment
827192 no no thats the shale layer which keeps this cave so dry
827193 so thats why this cave is lacking in stalactites and soda straws
827194 ive been through most of these cave passages and ive been lost several times but ive only seen one fossil down here its just ahead
827195 this is such an unusual group all of you are from the quincy hannibal area that hardly ever happens i think the owners should charge local people less for a tour youd be surprised at how many people in hannibal have never been to these caves

827211 as i said before the begin of the tournament the reason we were here was to make progress in the way we play stated nowak
827212 looking at this game maybe were a still a little bit na ve about international football going into games like this we have to anticipate that theyll be physical with a lot of contact so we have to prevail for us i think the second half we played much better progress has been made and we expect to go to tianjin tomorrow and polish the things that we need to this week

827224 the army doubled back on both campbell and the lions and ruled he cannot play pro football in 2008
827225 before the season starts could you please outlaw the word
827226 if you look at these astros a certain way you could convince yourself theyre not half bad
827227 theyre bullpen has the 10th best era in the nl
827228 when chekhov saw the long winter he saw a winter bleak and dark and bereft of hope yet we know that winter is just another step in the cycle of life but standing here among the people of punxsutawney and basking in the warmth of their hearths and hearts i couldnt imagine a better fate than a long and lustrous winter
827229 you stated that the astros starting pitching and hitting were both ranked 12th in the nl in an amazing coincidence they also have the 12th best record i think we should have someone at rice study this to see if their is a correlation
827230 im beginning to think its better to be dominant in one phase of the game and be lousy at the rest than to try to be above average at everything once you build a good rotation keep your hands off of it and plan replacements as natural attrition occurs

827234 sixteen years after brett favre came to the packers he is returning for a 17th season he has had a great career with our organization and although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
827235 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
827236 brett will be in camp tomorrow although there has been uncertainty regarding bretts return ted thompson and coach mccarthy had previously discussed this and have had a plan in place coach mccarthy will talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
827237 no matter what i look forward to another successful season for the packers and our fans this has been a tough situation but the packers will make the most of it
827238 snowflake is a new bsd licensed tool that parses sql select statements and generates a diagram
827239 orally at the sentencing hearing and transcribe such imposition in the courts journal entry failure to do so renders the sentence void
827240 this appeal requires us to balance the doctrine of res judicata and the peoples interest in the imposition of lawful proper sentences
827241 an issue that has been definitively settled by judicial decision
827242 is the fundamental understanding that no court has the authority to substitute a different sentence for that which is required by law because no judge has the authority to disregard the law a sentence that clearly does so is void
827243 it has an obligation to do so when its error is apparent
827244 is to be applied in particular situations as fairness and justice require and that is not to be applied so rigidly as to defeat the ends of justice or so as to work an injustice
827245 we would achieve neither fairness nor justice by permitting a void sentence to stand
827246 societys interest in enforcing the law and in meting out the punishment the legislature has deemed just
827247 neither constitutional principles nor the doctrine of res judicata require that sentencing become a game in which a wrong move by the judge or prosecutor means immunity for a defendant
827248 even though they havent caught a single break even though theyve been decimated by injuries even though every single personnel move hasnt worked out they make us proud day after day with their heart and professionalism

827250 are they good enough to win a championship with the group they now have no they arent
827251 why is the headline on our chron com astros about the yankees tigers trade and not the astros yankees trade what gives
827252 latroy gives us another experienced quality arm for our bullpen
827253 we tried to sign him during the offseason and lost out to the yankees but we are happy to have him here for the remainder of the season he gives manager cecil cooper one more weapon to call upon late in the game
827254 i told myself that i was going to stay in shape
827255 if i got traded i got traded or if i had to wait the full 10 days and get released and then sign with another team that was the way i was going to go i just wanted the chance to pitch again this year
827256 the seven games under 500 astros are actually trying to add players
827257 there are other people out there who have it much much worse than i do
827258 are they good enough to win a championship with the group they now have no they arent
827259 i wish i didnt know now what i didnt know then
827260 is there a possible draft compensation as with the randy wolf deal
827261 in trades wade has often been dangerous and uncreative but worst of all hes been unclear about the current goals of the team
827262 the astros cant compete this year but theyre trying to do just that mortgaging their future in the process ed wades just the man for the job an old school guy with a soft spot for relief pitchers
827263 no one can accuse the houston astros of being quitters despite the fact that houston is 12 1 2 games out of first place in the nl central the astros continue to look to be buyers before the trade deadline rather than sellers rival teams report that the astros are calling around in search of a high profile experienced reliever who might serve as a complement to doug brocail as houston makes its push for a playoff spot in august and september
827264 it doesnt matter where i hit in the lineup i dont need anybody im miguel tejada
827265 hes followed the baylor bears for years i dont know the words give up
827266 rival teams report that the astros are calling around in search of a high profile experienced reliever who might serve as a complement to doug brocail as houston makes its push for a playoff spot in august and september
827267 hope is that thing inside us that insists despite all the evidence to the contrary that something better awaits us if we have the courage to reach for it work for it and fight for it barack obama
827268 maybe the pressure of being a real big fish in a real small bowl has taken some of my edge
827269 try to pry laroche from the dodgers fleece somebody for the love of god
827270 if he stays healthy and effective the rest of this season hell likely be a type b free agent which will net the astros a sandwich pick between the 1st and 2nd rounds
827271 if ed wade wanted to make a deal he could probably trade geoff geary or jose valverde geoff blum and darin erstad could probably be traded as well trading them would make sense only if there was going to be a firesale if the plan is to add to the core then the astros ought to hold onto them
827272 are you assuming every team has the revenues of the yankees and red sox id like to meet the guy that thought it was a good idea to give an aggie a computer richard

827293 it does not matter how great you are with the english language and how well you can paint a picture with words mr justice you can not be with in 100 yards of your wife and children until further notice
827294 well we lost again but at least we have a nice bunch of guys out there

827356 and i asked where are you i told my husband and he grabbed the keys and he ran out of the door
827357 i used to sit at home with my friends in high school and watch kentucky fried movie and airplane and vomit from laughing
827358 then 9 11 happened and i couldnt take it anymore
827359 the response to 9 11 the right was saying this is pure evil were facing and the left was saying how are we at fault for this
827360 if he had been a republican president we would have demanded his resignation and marched on the white house
827361 when 9 11 happened i knew democrats wouldnt be strong enough to fight this war
827362 this morning i had another talk with the german chancellor herr hitler here is the paper which bears his name upon it as well as mine
827363 that negotiation went well fifty million dead worldwide nicely done mr chamberlain
827364 next item you must agree to stop supplying the explosive devices that are killing our american soldiers in iraq
827365 i figured he was like everyone else in hollywood a democrat
827366 and we knew that this was not a democrat movie
827367 we were afraid that he would not want to be involved in something that was so directly taking on the left and that he would not want to play the michael moore character
827368 i thought that the minute we started talking about politics that would be the end
827369 there was this dance that we did a dance familiar to conservative actors in hollywood lots of actors have done it
827370 i usually just bite my tongue unless it gets too ridiculous
827371 the only thing that really bothers me is when they go off about the president it just gets annoying
827372 if its the last movie i do ill go work for steves company
827373 im glad some of the bigger guys jumped in dennis hopper jon voight james woods
827374 the accepted way to speak about america is in the voice that disrespects it and the voice thats unacceptable is the one that loves america
827375 petraeus has to couch every bit of optimism in some convoluted formulation to avoid the promised rush of disrespect
827376 no one on the left wants to admit that radical islamists want to kill americans the jews everyone in the west
827377 i try to talk to my friends on the left and they just dont get it most of them have never even heard of sayyid qutb how can you have an intellectual discussion about the war were in without knowing who sayyid qutb is
827378 once they found out i was a republican unfortunately for some people it was a problem
827379 its almost like people who are gay show up at the baths and say oh i didnt know you were gay
827380 its too dark outside the sun is not the answer
827381 we really didnt have to do a lot of stretching
827382 radical christianity is just as threatening as radical islam in a country like america where we have a separation of church and state
827383 obama is not qualified to be president and itll be a disaster
827384 i dont think that obama is an evil guy i just think hes wrong but i do think we face real evil in ahmadinejad and the mullahs and all these crazy guys
827385 john kerry was and obama is fortunately kerry was a stiff but obama isnt a stiff and hes really adaptable hes like a really clever virus who adapts obamas the farthest left of all of these guys and thats why he associated with all of those crazies terrorists preachers of hate
827386 when i look at the other side when i look at barack obama i see expediency
827387 hes like family i could never disown him i didnt know him i didnt hear those words in that church
827388 its a movie its a satire and its a funny satire i dont want to point to this thing just because there are so few films from conservative sources and make it a target its a movie lets not burden this little horse with additional weights
827389 if nothing ever broke in the lab i would suspect that you people were not really doing the science
827390 what the fuck is wrong with you that you cant take better care of your equipment
827391 come on now lets be like fonzie whats fonzie like
827392 how could you let this happen youll never be able to write a paper now
827393 how have your views of yourself and your career changed over time
827394 i recently heard a talk by dr big name and i was under the impression that any questions on this topic had been completely answered by his recent paper
827395 i think you must be mistaken they are not working on the same system
827396 really consider reading the literature to find out what other people were doing in the field
827397 i dont think that new theory is worth reading at all
827398 maybe you will write about that in your paper or maybe i will write something about it
827399 occasionally invit ing them to take their head out of their ass and look around
827400 dude i was here in the middle of the night after i got my kids to sleep and you left me with no buffer
827401 the main achievement is that russia has revived its influence in the world
827402 but morally we are too far from what is needed this cannot be achieved by the state through parliamentarianism
827403 in fact i think it can be done very soon and we have to talk with the new health minister datuk liow tiong lai i think he will be quite sympathetic to our needs
827404 however the concern here is attracting specialists to serve at the new hospitals
827405 they say that all the specialists were gravitating towards the centre in perth itself and they had to close many of the district hospitals because they cannot find specialists to work there
827406 that is in an advanced country so can you imagine how hard it is for us to get specialist doctors to serve in all divisional and district hospitals here
827407 sponsored by troops in iraq and afghanistan go k amp k
827408 shes had a really good life though much better than she would have had
827409 you look to see how wide they are and make sure they arent stiff legged you want clear eyes
827410 they have tons of personality when she wants to play she gets all jumpy
827411 you understand itll go all along its in the back of your mind but its still hard
827412 but if you buy from here you know its healthy you know theyve been treated well
827413 yeah ill bet that was really infuriating and im sorry
827414 youre nervous but you can get through this youve done it before and youll do it again
827415 oh my wife just got back from a trip its so hard to do double duty isnt it
827416 i was diagnosed with rp a while ago but it was one of those things i didnt really worry about she told the magazine
827417 we know older homeless people arent accessing mainstream services in their true numbers
827418 thats because they believe mostly correctly that existing homeless services dont address their complex needs
827419 another common reason is because they feel too proud or independent to use them
827420 so their numbers and the scale of the problem are going undetected
827421 if older homeless people are slipping under the radar of traditional homeless services then its fair to say their presence is registering as zero with the wider community
827422 we also have assisted the veterinary clinic move part of its clinic to new premises so that the business may continue
827423 businesses that have the courage to put their hand up and say ive got this disease shouldnt be left out to dry as a result of the quarantine
827424 there are 23 jobs on the line they have got two of their staff still in hospital that is very distressing for the highly respected owner of the business
827425 i just think the government has got to step in
827426 it is known that keli lane frequented this house prior to the birth of tegan and we believe that she visited there shortly after departing auburn hospital
827427 this has been an ongoing inquiry thats been going on for two years and today we will be conducting a forensic archaeological excavation at premises at gladesville searching for the remains of tegan lane
827428 i always did like a man in a uniform that one fits you grand why dont you come up sometime and see me im home every evening
827429 i remember greg norman when he lost the 1996 masters and he started to make bogeys and never stopped
827430 i said to my caddie i have to make a putt just one putt
827431 this is very important very important because were working hard for golf in argentina
827432 there is a considerable volume of material that needs to be digested
827433 these are the key issues thats why well be making sure that anyone who breaks those and faces prosecution when they are prosecuted they will be put on this website
827434 i would hope that in the future we have no one in the list
827435 another one of telstras obstructive tactics has been blown out of the water
827436 management should now abide by the decision of the independent umpire and end the stalling tactics
827437 telstra hr needs to come back to the bargaining table and put the mou to a vote of telstra employees
827438 let me make this clear we have moved on and we are now looking for better ways to guarantee employees future rights and conditions
827439 we have never seen it before and this demonstrates the sorts of political games that made negotiations impossible
827440 not only is this a different document the actu has deliberately withheld other important material
827441 as part of the compensation package were providing them the commonwealth with the likely impacts
827442 were doing modelling to give the commonwealth more information about what we believe will be the impact
827443 you might well say that its in my interests if you like to put demands on peter costello or otherwise
827444 peter costello in my view has earned the right to make a decision in his interests and that of his family and the electors of higgins in due course and announce it when hes ready to do so
827445 i would be very happy if peter costello makes the decision to stay and he obviously would come straight on to our frontbench
827446 i respect him i respect his wife tanya and their family theyve worked damned hard for this country
827447 its not until you walk in somebody elses shoes you get a feel for what they put up with the gruelling year in year out hard decisions and work that he put in sacrifices by his family to get us into the position we were in in november last year before mr rudd took control of things
827448 as far as im concerned peter costello has made us a better country hes earned the right to make a decision when it suits him
827449 obviously i wouldnt be human if i didnt say that there are some times when you wonder what is on the mind of some people and of course your family read the papers and hear these things
827450 but thats what weve all signed up for and my job is to make sure that i do the very best i can for australians
827451 menurutku semua tim telah menata ulang skuadnya namun kami akan bertarung untuk mencapai tujuan kami dengan semua yang dimiliki
827452 ac milan melakukan pembelian penting pada ronaldinho sebab ia adalah juara yang mampu mengubah jalannya pertandingan kapan saja juventus akan kembali mengicar papan atas roma meneruskan membangun apa yang telah mereka lakukan selama bertahun tahun fiorentina telah melengkapi skuad dan memiliki pelatih bagus mereka pasti akan memiliki sesuatu sepanjang musim ini
827453 kemudian ada kami yang akan mempertahankan scudetto dengan segala harganya kejuaraan ini akan berlangsung seimbang dan cantik
827454 tidak ada hal yang dapat dibandingkan saat ini mancini telah memenangkan banyak pertandingan bersama kami kemudian mourinho datang ia mourinho pintar dan memiliki kapabilitas teknik yang bagus ia menjelaskan konsepnya dengan jelas pada tim kami bekerja keras untuk mendapat hasil terbaik kamu dapat melihat tangannya mourinho sedang bekerja
827455 aids is the most complex the most challenging and probably the most demanding infectious disease humanity has ever had to face
827456 we dare not let down our guard this is an unforgiving epidemic
827457 we are going to be in this for the long haul
827458 its certainly far too early for declaring victory because the end of aids is nowhere in sight
827459 every day almost three times as many people become newly infected with hiv as those who start taking antiretroviral therapy
827460 we must categorically reject any attempt to so called normalise aids or treat this epidemic as just one of many medical problems
827461 now more than ever do we need an exceptional response
827462 i have been using the alma rush and i think its a fabulous drink i definitely have more energy and balance throughout the day i also take the s force multi vitamins i love that they are so inclusive and convenient im paying just a fraction of what it would cost to purchase all the elements contained in these multi vitamins i have been watching dr oz on the oprah show and wanted to take all the vitamins he recommended but was overwhelmed i was thrilled to learn that the seriesse multivitamins contain 99 of what dr oz advises all i have to add is calcium with d to the multivitamin pack it is so easy that i have not missed one day it is so uncomplicated to add this important step to my daily regiment i really am feeling much better i feel healthy relaxed and energized
827463 for the past few months ive been religiously taking amla rush multi vitamins and the joint support formula i work two jobs and have found that alma rush keeps me going at a nice pace im also taking the multi vitamins and am feeling healthier my sisters husband told me about joint support formula and how it helped relieve his knee and shoulder pain i work at delta airlines and do a lot of kneeling in the planes this has caused severe knee problems and ive been told that surgery is my next step i decided to exhaust all options before having surgery so i started taking joint control and i honestly cant believe how great my knees are feeling
827464 for the past three months i have been taking alma rush multi vitamins omegas and joint support the alma rush has given me an energy level i havent had in a long time and i feel healthier since taking the multis and omegas ive had a knee operation and have arthritis in both knees and pain in my shoulder and hands i operate tower cranes which involves climbing since taking joint support the pain is gone im passing the word to co workers because the s force products really do work

827746 its impact on price is quite small we only expect a modest rise a few per cent because its capital expenditure over 40 years
827747 our prices are only about one third of the delivered price where we expect the increases to be is in the actual cost of the energy the generation with gas prices going up with the carbon pricing and the 20 per cent renewables
827748 our existing network was built to handle the quarter acre block with a house and three power points and four globes but suddenly theyre being knocked down and replaced with six units with sophisticated electrical requirements
827749 and the network and transformers arent up to delivering the requirements of the more dense populations

827753 despite the doom and gloom over high fuel prices increases in road tax or indeed the unsafe antics of tailgaters mobile phone abusers and middle lane hogs the vast majority of motorists cannot imagine life without the car
827754 the message here for national and local government is that we need to learn to live with the car rather than constantly try to restrict the car
827755 if they manage to find a particular product at a particular supermarket the price has probably changed anyway
827756 thats not real world thats not the way people shop theyre not going to sit on the internet going through thousands of product items
827757 they cant grocery prices are going up because of the drought theyre going up because of a huge surge in global demand theyre going up because arable land is being used to produce things like ethanol
827758 its just a cover for the fact that labor cant do anything about grocery prices and they shouldnt have told the australian people that they could
827759 we do know we have no systemic problem in this company
827760 i mean we are still probably the safest airline flying around
827761 i am quite sure that things are talked about continual issues cause some reputational damage
827762 it is our job to make sure we get that reputation back
827763 were a very very conservative company we turn back on just about everything and so we should thats the way weve operated over so many years
827764 and by the way that is why we do have such a good record and that record is still very very good
827765 we do know we have no systemic problem in this company
827766 i mean we are still probably the safest airline flying around
827767 i wouldnt say were concerned about qantas safety at all in fact weve found no evidence of safety slipping within the airline or safety standards being allowed to drop at all
827768 but if things happen we need to be flexible and proactive and respond to those concerns and thats what were doing
827769 obviously events like manila where we had the aircraft depressurise they were an entirely different kind of a normal run of business things that are being reported almost daily

827772 the level of job advertisements remains at high levels particularly internet ads and in july the overall rate of decline has slowed
827773 however recent trends in job advertisements suggest that we will see an easing of employment growth in coming quarters consistent with the slowing in domestic conditions in australia over the first half of 2008

827782 wasnt a big part of the ipods success in its design that it was this cool looking object people wanted to be seen with
827783 that said i completely agree that paper books arent going anywhere theyre perfect
827784 i believe a more perfected product would physically show the amount left to read like pages left in a book

827792 today half the worlds population doesnt own any books theyll appreciate the advantages of having an electronic book

827794 of course those whose livelihoods depend on the design printing distribution and sale of printed books may find it all too easy to dismiss ebooks
827795 quite a jump to go from biggest book advocate to book burner in one short ill conceived step
827796 and long form writing rarely works digitally just look at the idea behind this website
827797 given that books are largely composed on screens these days it seems odd to reject the reading of them on screens which takes so much less time than the composition
827798 imagine a small desolate impoverished village purchasing and shipping dozens of books would be a logistical nightmare however distributing an ebook to each citizen and giving them access to as many books as are available digitally would be quite an easy task to accomplish
827799 besides who is going to set up the infrastructure to get an ebook to each citizen 6 billion ebooks even 6 million which villages count and free access to every digital book who is paying for this
827800 if you knew anything about writing long form you would know writers never read their work in entirety on screen they print it out
827801 what i find really odd is a that a major advocate for books and the largest bookseller in the world would push such a technology it just seems so anti brand and shows a huge lack of faith in their biggest selling product
827802 a novelist might spend a year or more hours each day looking at the text on the screen adding more editing throwing parts away revisiting earlier passages re ordering sections theres just no way theyll spend anything like that much time reading hard copy
827803 yeah cause nobody ever wrote and edited a book before electronic word processors

828516 typography is truly the invisible art of the last one hundred years even though it is in plain sight
828517 as obesity rates continue to rise globally and with lifestyle related heart disease the number one killer worldwide today there is increasing pressure on the food industry to play a greater role in educating consumers about what theyre eating
828518 given that so many consumers are taking time to read nutrition labels there is also a marketing opportunity for food manufacturers to provide consumer friendly information on labels that may entice shoppers to switch brands at the point of purchase
828519 the relationship between consumers and nutritional information and labeling provides unmistakable insight into health and diet concerns
828520 without question nutritional labeling can be a powerful marketing tool for savvy food manufacturers for example food marketers can make relatively low investments in pack and labeling changes compared to advertising and promotions and drive significant sales
828521 supplements or herbal products which can set you back anything from 10 to 70 a bottle are not the smart option but eating more fish certainly is
828522 this can lead to problems when there is no advice on safe use of the product or warning labels for certain groups who perhaps should not be using them as is the case for some medicines for example

828570 while i had listened to several of the bats casts over the last year it is only when you consume one sometimes two a day over the course of a week that you really begin to get the wow factor of all the bat has time to do i mean the intros alone are sort of other worldly
828571 bat segundo is clearly a nutcase i would advise anyone against paying him any credence
828572 what could quite possibly be the coolest radio show in the history of ever

828575 an interweb sideshow of great distinction and absolutely spiffing podcasts
828576 a terrific literary podcast that boasts some absolutely stellar author interviews
828577 i think most people would assume that both of those caveats have fallen by the wayside given the state of the global property market and the subprime meltdown
828578 having said all of that dismal swamp will never disappear because dismal swamp is actually a place name
828579 if the community has views about the name then wed like to hear them and well couple those with the research weve done and well end up making a decision probably in the next six weeks or two months
828580 the story of how this project came together is as amazing as the stories themselves in the book the work is a great cross pop cultural convergence that was nearly lost to history plus its just so damned beautiful come and see the batman you loved as a kid fighting godzilla

828596 as my marriage of eighteen years came to an end i was in a state of complete disorientation it literally took two years of putting one foot in front of the other finding a job renting an apartment spending my savings eating and eating some more before i began to sense that life would indeed go on it wasnt until i landed and got my bearings that i finally felt myself becoming a sexual being once again the first man i met who was attracted to me was a total surprise i was really in shock that someone was reacting to me in that way when he kissed me the first time i almost passed out it was a roaring rushing feeling very intense like a pleasant heart attack i ran away but then i came back pretty quick that relationship didnt last long but my new self assurance was here to stay i became aware of myself as having influence in life as having a force i realized that people liked me i began making eye contact with everyone i began encouraging joy in every aspect of my life
828597 so youre telling me that as a monogamous married woman youre prepared to never enjoy being sexual again in this lifetime
828598 during the last couple of years of our marriage my husband and i were actually very sexual
828599 honestly i had completely given up on the idea my husband and id had a difficult marriage and an ugly divorce when i found myself single at the age of 58 i relied on my closeness with my sister and my job as a nurse to give shape stability and meaning to my life since id been married at 19 id really never experienced myself alone in the world as a single woman now solo and middle aged the idea of dating was the furthest thought from my mind five years later i met jack at a bridge tournament a widower he was handsome and kind and seemed inexplicably interested in making conversation with me i was shocked when he asked me to dinner but i went home with a spring in my step i hadnt experienced in some forty years as we began dating i felt as though id had a complete blood transfusion to feel attractive appreciated and cared for was truly a miracle jack showed me that my life as a sexual woman was not over in fact in some ways it was just beginning he and i are now happily married and i feel like i have a whole new life

828619 this love of liberty is what binds our nation together
828620 the desire for freedom burns inside every man woman and child

828645 we found that men with a high level of sexism were less likely to donate to the womens organization after reading sexist jokes but not after reading either sexist statements or neutral jokes
828646 we found that upon exposure to sexist humor men higher in sexism discriminated against women by allocating larger funding cuts to a womens organization than they did to other organizations
828647 we also found that in the presence of sexist humor participants believed the other participants would approve of the funding cuts to womens organizations
828648 we believe this shows that humorous disparagement creates the perception of a shared standard of tolerance of discrimination that may guide behavior when people believe others feel the same way

828694 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
828695 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
828696 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
828697 there is purely circumstantial though highly suggestive evidence that might seem to link iraq with last falls anthrax terrorism
828698 there is also tremendous evidence that subsequent anthrax attacks are connected to iraq
828699 detected an apparent anthrax leak in december 2001 at the height of the anthrax mailings investigation but did not report it
828700 the political and journalistic establishment suddenly seems united in wanting to attack iraq
828701 now that we know that the us govt believes that anthrax came from the inside shouldnt cohen be a wee bit curious about what this warning was based on
828702 theres either a significant amount of money behind this or this is state sponsored or this is stuff that was stolen from the former soviet program
828703 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab

828724 a big name does not mean a big impact on the ground
828725 the bottom line is that those people are replaceable the organization has developed in such a way that it can survive and fill in any gap even if osama bin laden was to die
828726 al qaida might be facing setbacks in iraq but not in afghanistan and any loss will appear to its fighters as a triumph against the enemy not a defeat
828727 today we are in an environment where we may not need the large number or persistence of manned aircraft
828728 we can put unmanned aircraft predator reaper and other assets overhead for long endurance periods we call that persistent stare
828729 and with the reaper armed with hellfire and 500 pound precision weapons well be able to have a deadly stare if needed
828730 we have turned a corner in warfare by bringing in this new platform that complements and i stress complements our incredible manned capacity today
828731 so my task is to figure out which asset you use where and why to get the best effect in the battlespace
828732 the thing about unmanned aerial vehicles is they can stay overhead for a long time and not use a lot of gas
828733 there are periods where weve gone a week to ten days without having to release a single kinetic attack and that is a real success story
828734 will we need to have manned kinetic capability to respond either with overhead or ground alert the answer is yes for a period of time

828756 they did some then they went and got more this guy gave him way too much he went to sleep and never woke up
828757 these kids are not going to get out from under peer pressure
828758 i tell people if heroin is in your neighbourhood sell your house and get your freaking kid out of there right now get out of dodge
828759 my heart goes out to the parents its just a national tragedy this is supposed to be a beautiful community
828760 unfortunately because it can be snorted kids think the stigma of being a drug addict is removed
828761 theres not the same stigma as when a hard core drug user injects it
828762 if you look at natalie and you hear the description of her you would never in a million years think that she was a child that would use heroin
828763 you ask 10 out of 10 people what a typical heroin addict looks like and theyll say its a junkie in the street with a needle hanging out of their arm
828764 youre not going to see the telltale signs like track marks and needle marks
828765 the kids have been told about the detriment of using cocaine alcohol or marijuana but heroin was never discussed really thats something from a generation ago
828766 a kid was asleep at the table next to them and then his buddy comes out of the bathroom with a needle and blood running down his arm he had heroin in his pocket and he got arrested
828767 i approached her and she told me she got it in school that day
828768 when your daughter has had one overdose and they dont come home we both immediately started crying
828769 how can we be responsible for someone and not have any authority
828770 they look at their good healthy beautiful kid and they feel secure i dont want them to feel secure and thats what got to me at the wake i saw these mothers
828771 even with a 15 year old what do you do
828772 tie them down and take them to a doctor or to a rehab im not sure what the answer is and im not sure the officials know what the answer is either otherwise they would be doing more about it its just alarming
828773 his death is leading the way to a true all out war in the problem of drugs and cowardly acts of violence

828775 we play this game for twenty points you versus me whoever wins gets to be the boss of the day tomorrow and thats going to turn out very well for me
828776 whats the deal with someone asking me how often i shower its not like i stink
828777 that thing that we do every other night or every night after swimming where i fill the bathtub with soapy water
828778 just so you know there seems to be some confusion over showering versus bathing regardless petunia is cleaned almost every day i promise
828779 lets think about this do you like to hang out with smelly dirty people
828780 and now bee knows that telling someone you clean yourself once per week doesnt really convey that message
828781 if growing petunias its best to leave them in full sunlight and only water them when their soil is dry to the touch
828782 ive got to go to the potty ive got to go to the potty ive got to go to the potty

828816 pertumbuhan internet di dunia sangat luar biasa rebutan domain menjadi salah satu indikasinya karena itu seiring pertumbuhan internet yang kian melaju membuat lahirnya paradigma baru dalam kehidupan terutama e economy
828817 saat ini berbelanja atau melakukan transaksi bisnis lewat internet bukanlah barang baru tidak hanya di negara maju di kawasan asia pun sering dilakukan begitu juga di indonesia hebatnya meski pengguna internet di indonesia belum sebanyak negara asia lainnya namun berdasarkan riset yang dilakukan oleh badan riset independen ac nielsen indonesia menempati urutan keempat terbesar dalam belanja lewat internet di kawasan asia sayangnya prestasi itu bukanlah sesuatu yang patut dibanggakan masalahnya sebagian besar belanja digital dilakukan secara ilegal
828818 artinya meski di urutan keempat terbesar tetapi yang belanja mayoritas adalah penjahat penjahat
828819 yang sering dilupakan ketika membangun teknologi dan mengembangkan sistem pengamanannya orang hanya melihat dari satu sudut pandang saja padahal dengan sistem security yang handal bukan saja akan mencegah terjadinya kejahatan tetapi juga mendongkrak pendapatan sebuah perusahaan yang menggunakan teknologi tersebut
828820 bukan saja secara fisik tetapi juga secara logika ini yang sering dilupakan sistem security internet membutuhkan perhatian dari berbagai bidang
828821 yang paling banyak adalah carding yaitu menggunakan kartu kredit milik orang lain untuk berbelanja
828822 untuk kasus klikbca tak sempat menduga akan terjadi pengalaman kami mulai dari dibuatnya atm kartu debit sampai dengan klikbca yang kami bangun bagi nasabah memang kerap kali menemukan kendala apapun kami lakukan mulai dari merangkak berjalan sampai berlari itu semua kami lakukan satu persatu sampai dengan sekarang ini kami melakukan riset di berbagai negara khususnya amerika untuk membangun internet banking ini
828823 yang pernah terjadi adalah sebuah situs porno triple x membuat penawaran jika ingin masuk dan melihat gambar syur yang mampu menaikkan adrenalin silahkan melakukan registrasi dan transfer biaya sebesar rp 10 000 lewat bca herannya banyak yang tanpa sadar melakukan itu ketika registrasi akhirnya sang korban akan memberikan nomor pin bca nya akibatnya dalam waktu sekejap rekeningnya kosong tak bersisa
828824 padahal kami membuat registrasi begitu mudahnya seperti juga atm setiap nasabah memiliki pin artinya setiap nasabah bisa secure kartunya masing masing begitu juga dengan internet banking sesungguhnya
828825 dari seluruh kejahatan tersebut bca mengalami kerugian sebesar rp 670 juta kami anggap itu sebagai uang hilang untuk biaya sekolah
828826 langkah pertama kami telah memaksimalkan internet security system yang ada secara terus menerus dan optimal kami memberikan pendidikan pada masyarakat dan nasabah dan yang terakhir kami membuat dan menyerahkan sistem keamanan pribadi kepada para nasabah dengan membekali perangkat security berupa key bca
828827 karena itu kami terus menerus melakukan perbaikan internet security system sehingga jika disimpulkan berdasarkan pengalaman yang dialami bca ada tiga hal penting dalam mengimplementasikan internet banking yaitu kita harus kuat dalam membangun bisnis yang ada kuat dalam investasi dan mempertajam solusi keamanannya terutama dengan menggunakan sistem keamanan dinamik
828828 karena sebagian besar pelakunya bermotif ekonomi kecuali pelaku yang membuat situs plesetan bca karena sesungguhnya tidak semua kejahatan komputer dan internet bertujuan akhir pada ekonomi

828836 well you should hear it every day tell your old man that youre special
828837 began with a ferry ride from port angeles washington to victoria british columbia we then drove to sidney where we waited for bill to arrive in his 20 tugboat
828838 because we knew he cherishes his time and we didnt know how much of it hed have to give us
828839 without fuss he repositioned the springline so he could reverse around the corner of the dock and off we went to toads landing as his home is called
828840 our tour began at his dock where a wonderful 30 runabout of his design was in a covered slip
828841 janie shooed us off so she could get back to work and bill led us to the first of two large waterfront boat sheds
828842 on the railway in the upper shop was an old ray hunt designed international 110 freshly painted and next to it a fiberglass lapstrake whitehall to which bill had added a plywood sheerstrake she was
828843 before we left the upper shop we stopped at a small alcove where there were more full and half hull models as well as old pictures of favorite boats and friends and good moments
828844 we ascended a small hill to bills house and spent the next few hours going over plans and pictures and models
828845 it was a magical day in a world where you have to try harder to find magic
828846 if the mediterranean the venerable and sometimes atrociously ill tempered nurse of all navigators was to rock my youth the providing of the cradle necessary for that operation was entrusted by fate to the most casual assemblage of irresponsible young men all however older than myself that as if drunk with provencal sunshine frittered life away in joyous levity on the model of balzac s
828847 she who was my cradle in those years had been built on the river of savona by a famous builder of boats was rigged in corsica by another good man and was described on her papers as a tartane of sixty tons
828848 her name was the tremolino how is this to be translated the quiverer what a name to give the pluckiest little craft that ever dipped her sides in angry foam i had felt her it is true trembling for nights and days together under my feet but it was with the high strung tenseness of her faithful courage in her short but brilliant career she has taught me nothing but she has given me everything i owe to her the awakened love for the sea that with the quivering of her swift little body and the humming of the wind under the foot of her lateen sails stole into my heart with a sort of gentle violence and brought my imagination under its despotic sway the tremolino to this day i cannot utter or even write that name without a strange tightening of the breast and the gasp of mingled delight and dread of one s first passionate experience
828849 we would travel by plane through the mountains and then wed hitch a riiiide with the yeti to the pool of everlasting life we called it shangri la we wore thin cotton tights in the freezing snow which was the fashion in those days and we fought our way through the styrofoam snow jungle to meet the cursed garden gnome emperor

828853 kita tidak bisa mengadopsi kurikulum di mit misalnya secara utuh karena harus disesuaikan jadi untuk yang ingin membuka jurusan ini harus berbasis data tentang apa yang dibutuhkan masyarakat

828855 jangan terlalu tinggi nanti kecanggihan atau jangan juga berkemampuan rendah tentu tidak menjawab persoalan jadi memang harus pas

828996 it is our job to make sure we get that reputation back
828997 an extraordinary situation and around the world on any day airlines would be found having turnbacks
828998 were a very very conservative company we turn back on just about everything and so we should thats the way weve operated over so many years

829257 yes weve successfully had individuals not associated with a business sign up to winqual for crash reports with just certificate x

829259 the bottom line is that when an exception is thrown your program is in an unknown state
829260 and by the time the product ships there should be no known states that the programmer coulda wouda shoulda covered but didnt
829261 if the feature in question is not of that quality level then it should be pulled out or the release delayed at least this is the case in the commercial world

829273 a sun solaris server that had not been patched against a previously disclosed ftp vulnerability even though a fix was available for the flaw at the time of the breach

829410 the small animal clinic can still operate and we have also helped them to open another equine practice at another location it is completely safe
829411 the government has established a strong working relationship with dr lovell and we will continue to work with him during this difficult time
829412 i can understand how there could be that perception that it is unsafe
829413 we are following all bio security measures and the small animal section is separate to the equine clinic
829414 i wouldnt say were concerned about qantas safety at all in fact weve found no evidence of safety slipping within the airline or safety standards being allowed to drop at all

829431 this isnt peak oil but it is an oil crisis and its not just because of greedy speculators demand has consistently outpaced supply for the last decade and increased conflict in oil producing nations has made people rightly in my view skeptical of future production from those nations
829432 the impact these investment fund flows have had in recent years also remains unclear an iea expert roundtable in march discussed the many aspects that feed the current oil price there were vastly different views on the effects of money flows on the oil market in the ieas opinion the limited information available makes it impossible to account meaningfully for the cross market interactions that routinely take place between different futures exchanges and over the counter otc markets further what information there is fails to capture the true split between commercial and non commercial activity however while the weight of money debate remains open there is an almost unanimous agreement among analysts that the oil price has recently been compensating for the weakness of the us dollar indeed stripping out the currency impact since 2007 shows a much closer fit between oil prices and global balances
829433 says the actual costs incurred in producing the most expensive oil is only around 70 or 80 a barrel meaning that about 50 of the current price represents the markets risk premium plus speculation
829434 put it all together and the supply outstripping demand theory of the feverish price action since march is emanating an extremely fish like odor

829451 i often find that stories about china diverge from the truth why
829452 it is ironic that china a country that does not allow the operation of a free press should accuse the western media of bias in its coverage of the dramatic events in tibet including the use of double standards
829453 the dalai lama whom in the past was funded by cia originally pushed for independence for tibet which was a slavery feudal society prior taken over by the p r c government

829464 40 years experience of a heavy handed government that controls all mainstream media has conditioned a society to avoid speaking up and participating in civic and political affairs the resulting self censorship is more insidious and intractable than overt censorship by other less subtle governments

829476 but i feel real confident that well turn this around and swing the bats the way were capable of
829477 we dont want to be scoreboard watching later on we dont want to wait til september to make our move we have to push ourselves and get it going again
829478 we should be ok some of the guys i wont say they were pressing but in situations we werent getting hits

829487 eric had a dose equivalent to 190 years of background radiation
829488 johns was 107 the mods maximum safe dose was just 30
829489 hopefully this will mean they have to admit everything else
829490 there were 20 000 others there they and their families suffered just as badly
829491 in reality they have no idea who had how much dose eric and john had records taken but most had none those who had film badges for the explosions were made to hand them in and they were never labelled to show who was wearing them
829492 the lack of adequate hostel provision and the shocking increase in waiting lists for social housing reflect the failure of the state to understand this complex problem it is alarming that the most vulnerable women are faced with the unenviable choice of squatting sleeping rough or relying on family or friends for accommodation a big part of this problem stems from labours failure to build enough housing in every category over the last decade
829493 this report underestimates the true numbers because it only includes those accepted by councils as a priority many vulnerable women escaping domestic violence lie low and stay away from councils altogether so are not counted those who ask for help are not always accepted as a priority and dont make any lists this is a largely hidden problem which these numbers only touch upon
829494 councils have to take more responsibility for these vulnerable people yes we need more houses but the government has to be more creative with the private sector if we are ever going to meet housing needs
829495 it has been virtually impossible for councils to build new homes because they cant borrow money on the open market
829496 last year was the first time since 1983 that we built more social houses than were lost through right to buy our recent housing bill and the creation of the homes and communities agency will help to deliver council homes more quickly and will make it easier for councils to build their own social housing to meet the needs
829497 vietnams illegal trade in wildlife continues unabated and affects neighbouring countries
829498 hanoi is the cultural and political centre of vietnam where wildlife protection and conservation policies are issued and implemented
829499 this suggests that the gap between policies and implementation of wildlife protection is still big
829500 many high profile animals of global conservation concern such as tigers bears or rhinos can still be bought on the market provided prior notice is given and that the price negotiated is high enough
829501 any type of medicinal animal if ordered sufficiently in advance
829502 as soldiers prepare to be deployed on italian streets an city mayor has been accused of fascism after he passed an edict banning groups of more than three people congregating in parks and public gardens
829503 the anti gathering laws were enacted as thousands of soldiers were due to take to the streets of italian cities for the first time on monday under a controversial move by prime minister silvio berlusconi to fight crime
829504 reminiscent of benito mussolinis edict of the 1920s which banned groups of five or more people

829529 tante ben je zeker dat ik niet genoeg geld heb
829530 je weet het dat je niet genoeg geld hebt om ze te kopen
829531 nee waar mijn zusje nu is kan de kerstman niet komen ik moet de pop aan mijn mama kunnen geven zodat zij ze naar mijn zusje kan brengen
829532 mijn zusje is vertrokken naar waar jezus is mijn papa zegt dat mama weldra ook naar jezus gaat en daarom dacht ik dat mama de pop kon meenemen en ze aan mijn zusje geven
829533 ik heb aan papa gezegt dat hij tegen mama moest zeggen dat ze niet meteen mag vertrekken ik heb hem gevraagd haar te doen wachten tot ik terugkeer van de winkel
829534 ik wil dat mama deze foto ook meeneemt zo zal ze me niet vergeten ik hou van mijn mama en ik zou graag hebben dat ze me niet verlaat maar papa zegt dat ze naar mijn zusje moet gaan
829535 en als we nog eens een laatste keer je geld zouden tellen om zeker te zijn
829536 dank je jezus dat je me genoeg geld gegeven hebt
829537 ik had aan jezus gevraagd om ervoor te zorgen dat ik genoeg geld zou hebben om deze pop te kopen zodat mijn mama ze naar mijn zusje kan brengen hij heeft mijn gebed gehoord ik wilde ook nog genoeg geld hebben om een witte roos te kopen voor mijn mama maar zoveel durfde ik aan jezus niet vragen maar weet je mijn mama houdt zoveel van witte rozen

829542 the internet is possibly one of the greatest tools for democratization and individual freedom that weve ever seen
829543 we are in the midst of the most severe food crisis in the worlds history
829544 this is not your mothers food shortage but a chronically tight food situation a serious and long term problem
829545 the more influential countries would be able to secure food supplies leaving a number of low income less influential countries with no food to import
829546 there has been no incentive to sell the rice stocks
829547 the chinese have sacrificed their self sufficiency in soybeans in order to preserve land and water for other crops
829548 china only needs to import 10 percent of its grain consumption to influence markets greatly
829549 more restrictions on grain exports would hurt chinas ability to assume its leading role of a big country in the current crisis
829550 the side effects of further tightening of exports would be significant and there will be more harm than benefit
829551 we are the ones who move the merchandise that this country needs to function
829552 if we dont have the money to keep buying fuel to offer this public service well then this country comes to a halt
829553 i would suggest that the likelihood of that happening sooner has increased tremendously sometime in the summer
829554 demand for oil is weak but supplies are even weaker
829555 according to the may 1 2008 ccc inventory report there are o nly 24 1 million bushels of wheat in inventory so after this sale there will be o nly 2 7 million bushels of wheat left the entire ccc inventory
829556 our concern is not that we are using the remainder of our strategic grain reserves for humanitarian relief aam fully supports the action and all humanitarian food relief our concern is that the u s has nothing else in our emergency food pantry there is no cheese no butter no dry milk powder no grains or anything else left in reserve the o nly thing left in the entire ccc inventory will be 2 7 million bushels of wheat which is about enough wheat to make of a loaf of bread for each of the 300 million people in america
829557 this lack of emergency preparedness is the fault of the 1996 farm bill which eliminated the governments grain reserves as well as the farmer owned reserve for
829558 we had hoped to reinstate the for and a strategic energy grain reserve in the new farm bill but the politics of food defeated our efforts as farmers it is our calling and purpose in life to feed our families our communities our nation and a good part of the world but we need better planning and coordination if we are to meet that purpose aam pledges to continue our work for better farm policy which includes an for and a strategic energy grain reserve
829559 the stuff that should have been harvested over the weekend wont survive more than another day or so the stuff we have in storage is getting riper every minute and at some point it will have to be disposed of
829560 the reality is that the entire tomato industry is being impacted
829561 it wasnt really clear that round and romas from california are safe to eat thats part of the problem
829562 u s consumers have started to reject orders that have already been promised or sent and it is causing a lot of damage to producers
829563 the commission is determined to use all necessary means to prevent a recurrence of the substantial overfishing seen in 2007
829564 last year overfishing was largely driven by the industrial purse seine sector of the fleet which takes more than 70 per cent of the total catch
829565 we may not ultimately know the farm where these came from
829566 there is certainly a high likelihood that they came from mexico or florida
829567 there is a shortage of a lot of foods like milk and dairy based products of which there are practically none
829568 theres no chicken and there is a shortage of flour and cooking oil
829569 extending the roadblocks by two days is making everything worse
829570 most butcher shops havent received any meat for over a week
829571 up until now some fish species have been known by up to 20 different names depending on what state or region the fish were landed
829572 its like having a gtx holden theres no such thing
829573 its the first time a single reference point for fish names has existed in australia
829574 the message for consumers is look for the new logo
829575 its obvious that these export restrictions fuel the fire of price increases
829576 people are in a panic so they are buying more and more at least those who have money are buying
829577 one countrys act to promote food security is another countrys food insecurity
829578 were having trouble buying the stocks we need for emergency operations
829579 we had to slow down the scale up of our operation as a result of having to redesign our supply lines
829580 that means on the ground there were beneficiaries that went without rations or went without full rations for a portion of time in the case of afghanistan some didnt get into the program
829581 if egypt had to be self sufficient in food there would be no water left in the nile
829582 if every country in the world decided it wanted to produce its own food for consumption
829583 there would be less food in the world and more people would be hungry
829584 the subsidies given by developed countries to their farmers have led to lack of investment in agriculture in developing countries
829585 the main cause of rising rice prices is the rising cost of rice planting
829586 we will choose those who instigate violent protests and those who use violence to the end and bring them to justice
829587 if we are to get food prices down we must do more to deal with unnecessary demand such as by all of us doing more to cut our food waste which is costing the average household in britain around 8 per week
829588 the solution lies in raising the potential of food production in the developing world
829589 if yields in africa and elsewhere reached their potential global food output would be much higher far fewer people would go hungry and social instability around the world would decrease
829590 world leaders must reiterate their promises to increase aid and make the necessary reforms including increasing investment in agriculture in poor countries
829591 supplementing cows with growth hormone on an industry wide scale would improve sustainability
829592 routinely shooting up cows with a genetically modified hormone to squeeze more milk from them offers no sustainable solution to intensive farmings carbon footprint nor for animal welfare
829593 it is deeply hypocritical that they should be lavishing course after course on world leaders when there is a food crisis and millions cannot afford a decent meal to eat
829594 if the g8 wants to betray the hopes of a generation of children it is going the right way about it the food crisis is an emergency and the g8 must treat it as that
829595 the g8 have made a bad start to their summit with excessive cost and lavish consumption
829596 surely it is not unreasonable for each leader to give a guarantee that they will stand by their solemn pledges of three years ago at gleneagles to help the worlds poor all of us are watching waiting and listening
829597 we need a global plan to deal with rising food prices that are affecting millions of families in britain thats why i am proposing that we take action to both increase the global supply of food and reduce unnecessary demand
829598 if we are to get food prices down we must also do more to deal with unnecessary demand such as by all of us doing more to cut our food waste which is costing the average household in britain around 8 per week
829599 i think when we will look back we will say this was the beginning of a turning point for europe on biofuels
829600 it will be very difficult now for europe to stick by its targets
829601 we have to decide if the quota can be kept
829602 given uncertainty and potential concerns the government will adopt a more cautious approach until the evidence is clearer on environmental and social effects of biofuels
829603 practically straight maximum height of the arc 10 mm per 10 cm of the length of cucumber
829604 to reach a satisfactory degree of ripeness the refractometrix index of the flesh measured at the middle point of the fruit pulp at the equatorial section must be greater than or equal to 8 brix
829605 we dont need 34 regulations to decide how round an artichoke should be or how thin a cucumber can be
829606 a bent cucumber is as good as a straight one
829607 marketing standards play an important role in facilitating and ensuring transparency in market operations while protecting customers at the same time
829608 the bent cucumber beside its maligned compatriot the straight banana has been wielded by eurosceptics eager to clobber the european union
829609 bendy cucumbers nobbly strawberries and apples the wrong shade of red are to make a comeback in our supermarkets
829610 he has enough information on the label to make a decision about what he wants to buy its real competition
829611 my clients know what they are buying and they know that if its labeled extra it tastes better and costs more and they will buy it
829612 people will pay for the value of what they see and what they taste
829613 the french want fruit to be ripened on the vine to get the most vitamins
829614 regulation eec no 2213 83 of 28 july 1983 laying down quality standards for onions and witloof chicory
829615 we are catching less and less fish and the seaweeds are fouling our nets
829616 this is one of the most damaging seaweeds i have ever seen
829617 if there is that much eucheuma in butaritari it proves it can destroy a healthy reef as opposed to a degraded one like in kaneohe
829618 no part of the coral reef was visible in most of the invaded sites where it doomed entire colonies
829619 whats the point of making money if you have to pubusi it all away
829620 the government raised the price we pay to farmers to 60 cents a kilo so we lose 27 cents a kilo by the time weve shipped it to the processing plant
829621 the government didnt give us the difference last year so we were only able to buy 100 tons and the farmers are now stuck with 250 tons
829622 then the people would go out and get it and it would be gone in a few months
829623 if we got a grant for that purpose maybe but
829624 introduced species have had large impacts on marine ecosystems around the world
829625 we should avoid the intentional introduction of species that are known to harm coral not promote it
829626 the sides of the hills will slowly slip into the pristine blue waters
829627 and the lake will clog with silt and mud not only that but the rivers will be damaged as well
829628 ill do more laundry more cleaning we will survive we will find a way
829629 there are not enough jobs for everybody i dont know what id do el salvador is nothing without coffee

829631 the sides of the hills will slowly slip into the pristine blue waters
829632 and the lake will clog with silt and mud not only that but the rivers will be damaged as well
829633 ill do more laundry more cleaning we will survive we will find a way

829636 sketching out what it would take to pilot a vertical farm
829637 im viewed as kind of an outlier because its kind of a crazy idea
829638 why cant it be six stories theres some exciting potential in the concept but i think he overstates what can be done
829639 would a tomato in lower manhattan be able to outbid an investment banker for space in a high rise my bet is that the investment banker will pay more
829640 theres embodied energy in the concrete and steel and in construction
829641 i believe that this general relationship is going to hold even as transportation costs go up and carbon costs get incorporated into the economic system
829642 im a biologist swimming in very deep water right now
829643 if i were to set myself as a certifier of vertical farms i would begin with security
829644 how do you keep insects and bacteria from invading your crops
829645 it also has to be stunning in terms of the architecture because it needs to work in terms of social marketing
829646 you want people to say i want that in my backyard
829647 we cannot do a project without knowing where and why and what we are going to cultivate for example in paris if you grow some wheat its stupid because we have big fields all around the city and lots of wheat and its good wheat theres no reason to build towers that are very expensive
829648 already for some kids its too late but its not too late for many many other children who need assistance until the next harvest comes in
829649 we want rapid assistance now in order to prevent large scale and long term damage
829650 given the fragile and critical nutritional situation in the country if such resources dont come on time we will see the situation worsening beyond the current level
829651 fda has found a genetically matched salmonella stpaul isolate from a distribution center called agricola zaragosa in mcallen texas
829652 the tectonic plates are shifting on food the fundamentals are changing
829653 consumers are more visible in cities especially when they riot
829654 yeah im full i feel like im going to burst
829655 it depends on the dish but ive never gotten a complaint that its too little
829656 weve looked at large portion sizes almost entirely in terms of whether its healthy for us and now we have to consider is that sort of a demand going to be sustainable
829657 it would probably be a way to take pressure off of grain markets if we somehow convinced people to take smaller portion sizes
829658 stuffed and starved the hidden battle for the world food system
829659 but its unusual to see it in the united states where ive seen reports of low income american families doing what low income families in the third world do which is skipping meals particularly women skipping meals so their kids can eat
829660 theres certainly a sort of downshift in the quality and sometimes for the poorest americans the quantity of food theyre able to afford
829661 the typical adult eats at a restaurant nearly six times a week and more than half say eating out is an essential part of their lifestyle
829662 ive seen some anecdotal reports in the press about restaurants saying theyre making the portions a little bit smaller in order to save money but i havent seen that as a general trend in going into restaurants
829663 so if you pay a dollar for an order of french fries only about 20 cents goes for the potatoes the oil and the salt
829664 when a restaurant sells a large fry instead of a small fry the cost of the potatoes themselves adds only a little bit of cost and all their other costs of doing business stay the same so companies make a lot more profit off of big portion sizes
829665 yes portion sizes are large in the u s but people who tend not to have choice about portion sizes are people who are on lower incomes who buy prepackaged food which comes in those fixed portion sizes
829666 blaming the consumer for what is available on the market isnt a satisfactory explanation for why theres a food crisis
829667 there is no use beating around the bush this meeting has collapsed members have simply not been able to bridge their differences
829668 we will need to let the dust settle a bit its probably difficult to look too far into the future at this point
829669 wto members will need to have a sobre look at if and how they bring the pieces back together
829670 the package that we were able to negotiate and agree on friday night is not going to carry the day
829671 they the united states have refused to move on ssm it is an issue of vital importance to us
829672 the united states and india did not accept the compromise proposals and arrived at an impasse
829673 the us cannot afford to give way on cotton so it does not even want to go into the issue on cotton
829674 by holding firm to its line on ssms it knows that india would not give ground on ssms in which case india would be blamed in case of any collapse
829675 throughout the last 10 days and in the months and years prior to this the united states have shown leadership in trying to get this done we remain committed to the doha round
829676 us commitments remain on the table awaiting reciprocal responses it is critical that we move forward
829677 i think it would be a very good beginning if whatever understandings we have achieved in this one week are in one way or another captured in revised texts
829678 we cant give up we have too much at stake we have invested too much in this round
829679 food is available but people cannot afford to buy it if the situation gets worse we could have starvation in the next six to 12 months
829680 we had been going in the right direction and this crisis threatens that
829681 we need to raise our prices but its their last resort and people wont tolerate it
829682 now were having to feed the mothers as well as the babies
829683 i use jokes to try to stimulate my students to wake them up
829684 for 20 years politicians have been talking about reviving agriculture but didnt actually do anything if this food crisis forces them to act then it is a big opportunity
829685 people want out of here its like were almost dead people
829686 theres one set of food for one part of the city another set of food for another part of the city and its very stratified that way
829687 the costs being incurred by organic producers are rising much faster than for conventional production
829688 the price we get currently for organic milk is not high enough to cover the cost of production there will have to be an increase in the price that producers receive
829689 in this context it is no longer attractive for conventional farms to convert and we are seeing producers undergoing conversion exiting that process the concern is that the relatively small number of leavers becomes a mass exit among existing producers
829690 there is a real danger that a supply shortage could take hold rather quickly if just 30 of our larger organic farms revert to non organic production we will lose 10 per cent of our supplies
829691 perhaps it is inevitable that we might see some decline in demand among less deeply committed organic consumers
829692 it is a bitter irony for us but after so many years of talking about the virtues of growing your own and british produce people are doing it and it is resulting in a fall in trade
829693 we normally see a 20 per cent drop in sales in summer which lasts from july to september but now that period is being extended to from june until november
829694 people are still coming to us but it is for more exotic things they cannot produce themselves and that means bigger imports we have gone from being 85 per cent british to 78 per cent
829695 the highest national interest is the eu membership and we will not give it up but this does not mean that the government will agree to any blackmail
829696 if someone thinks that this pro european government will give up on defending national interests for the sake of european perspectives they are wrong
829697 we are bussing in people to pietermaritzburg because this is a national issue
829698 we demand the case be dropped were collecting one million signatures from former soldiers of umkhonto we sizwe the ancs armed wing during the apartheid era and well petition the court
829699 this is a political case in which efforts are being made to stop the old man becoming the president of the country
829700 throughout the investigation and prosecution of this case the anc president has had his rights repeatedly violated by institutions of state specifically the national prosecuting authority npa
829701 he has been subjected to a vicious and unrelenting trial by media having been found guilty long before his case has even come to court
829702 until such time as a court tells us otherwise jacob zuma is an innocent person
829703 that is why the anc has supported him until now and will continue to support him
829704 there is a wider layer of poor and marginalised people who believe zuma has been the victim of conspiracy and of a political elite which has not taken care of their interests
829705 for them this is a witch hunt designed to undermine their man going for the top job
829706 we are not going to speculate or jump to conclusions until we have gathered all the evidence
829707 that two weeks has got to be looked at from the point of view that they did take a four or five day break to go and consult
829708 we would like to see the speedy conclusion of the talks and successful outcome so that we can focus in the future our attention around our economy
829709 afghanistan has been a prize that pakistan and india have fought over directly and indirectly for decades
829710 to pakistan afghanistan represents a strategic rear base that would along with the islamic nations of ex soviet central asia offer a united front against hindu dominated india and block its rivals access to energy rich regions conversely for india a friendly afghanistan would pressure pakistan on its western border just as india itself pressures pakistan on its eastern border thus dealing pakistan a strategic defeat
829711 unless we address whats angering the isi we wont be able to stabilize afghanistan or capture al qaeda leaders inside its borders
829712 only it didnt the links were loosened but they remain for the simple reason these militants are viewed as vital pawns in a bigger game keeping afghanistan unsettled to limit the united statess and by extension arch rival indias influence in the region
829713 this is a military doctrine about national survival not an ideology of religious fanaticism civilians are not welcome to meddle with it
829714 until the issue has become both impossibly murky and highly emotive
829715 driving already frozen north south relations into a catastrophic phase
829716 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying
829717 they leave the security council no choice but to increase the sanctions as called for in the last resolution passed
829718 we are serious in continuation of fair talks that can produce practical and fruitful results
829719 the consequences of a possible military confrontation are so heavy that everyone is trying all other options to find a solution
829720 the iran u s crisis is spinning out of control tehran is willing to buy time in the coming four months to avoid a crisis
829721 he came here to convey the message of the french president
829722 it is absurd because at maximum he can convey this message that the threat of the west is serious which already is known to iran
829723 iran has accepted the idea of freeze for freeze but it does not make it public because of national pride
829724 iran does not want to fall in the trap laid by the europeans if it says publicly it accepts freeze for freeze the europeans would take it one step ahead
829725 on the whole iran and syria are in unison and before making any important decision the other country should be consulted
829726 olmert resigns the process of peace talks and negotiation over the israeli occupied golan heights will be murky and unclear once again

829730 for some people sports and their fanship are as important as their religion and their family
829731 for a lot of people its psychologically important to have a sense of community and identity and sports can be their main avenue of doing that
829732 whats beautiful about a tattoo is that its not like a shirt which you can take off it shows youre really committed youre not a fair weather person it says that this is important to you and it will be important to you until you die

829809 a big challenge in the world of corporate blogging is getting busy people who already have a lot on their plates to commit to blogging
829810 one successful tactic in doing so is convincing them its worth their while
829811 i thought that the number of fortune 500 bloggers would have been higher i think the reason is that companies are still grappling with how they participate in the conversation when they dont have control over the message
829812 small businesses are often better positioned to take advantage of social networking than larger businesses because they often seem more approachable and so customers and prospects are more likely to be interested in connecting with them online
829813 at conferences around the world weve heard marketers say that their biggest challenge is executives resistance because they fear losing control
829814 but this research indicates that this may not be as big of an issue as marketers think the bigger challenge is focusing the community around a purpose that people want to contribute to and be involved with and devoting the right resources to promote and support the community
829815 that speculative activity in the futures markets causes such severe and unwarranted fluctuations in the price of cash onions a complete prohibition of onion futures trading in order to assure the orderly flow of onions in interstate commerce
829816 it seems clear that futures trading in onions was prohibited simply because too few members of congress believed that the onion futures market was on balance economically useful
829817 if there was no futures trading in oil you would see oil prices much higher today
829818 the volatility in onion prices makes the swings in oil and corn look tame reinforcing academics belief that futures trading diminishes extreme price swings

829852 i would have thought an arrangement like that would have given the public a better picture as to how infrastructure was going to be developed in our community but i guess you have to be careful if you have people that want to do things in secret theyll do as they please whether theyve been elected to uphold the public trust or not

829857 the level of job advertisements remains at high levels particularly internet ads and in july the overall rate of decline has slowed

829876 i joined linkedin responding to a friend who asked me to join and i use it passively for information introductions to others etc
829877 i thought it was a good way to connect to professionals in our field and to keep in touch now that im pretty busy with work i dont have much time for it
829878 at least once a week for one reason or another i find that i use it to look for old personal contacts as much as new business contacts
829879 i check linkedin but infrequently i plan on using a group i created to reconnect with classmates
829880 a couple of folks ive done business with have found me and linked to me on here which has allowed me to write recommendations for them and hopefully improve their business
829881 this technology feeds an urge for us to share what we are doing and to follow what others are doing
829882 it is never ending i find myself sometimes fire up twitter or friendfeed or whatever service late in the evening just out of curiosity what are people up too right now

829885 that does it for my dreams of becoming a clergyman i guess
829886 the court is profoundly concerned about the very poor judgment which this childs parents have shown in choosing this name
829887 it makes a fool of the child and sets her up with a social disability and handicap unnecessarily
829888 it is a parents right to name a child and this judge has overstepped boundaries
829889 some kids dont like their names let her change her name when she gets older
829890 the parents who bestowed such a name upon their child in the first place or the dictatorial censorship
829891 doesnt like to see governments charging in and taking over the state exists to serve the citizens not vice versa and while stepping in to change a grossly ludicrous name seems to be a reasonable measure whenever anything like this happens i find myself wondering what the potential next step is
829892 id like to think that the name is simply the result of new zealand being upside down
829893 but an unfortunately large number of baby name weirdos reside here too you know these people they have last names like roberts johnson and michael and name their children robert john and michael respectively

829901 were going to expand on the reign of starscream story that were doing and tie everything in to what this next movie is going to be
829902 the next movie starts out with just tons of action and theres obviously going to be a lot of questions so were hoping to answer some of those beforehand
829903 were definitely taking every character that we can from the sequel
829904 so youll see some sector 7 involvement and what really happened to them
829905 we had this really ambitious script done where there were a lot of fan favorites in there but some of them are going to be making an appearance in the second movie so they asked us not to use those which is understandable
829906 starscream s more of like a military guy so in destiny were going to see a lot more involvement with the backgrounds of prime and megatron as well as cybertrons history and how that affects the present day it all centers around the plot of the sequel which i obviously cant get into itll be explained but youll see a lot more expansion of their characters and their motivations and their destinies if you will
829907 two of those fan favorite characters are soundwave and arcee
829908 say it loud im black and im proud and african american to some thats empowering i dont understand this argument because no one questions why irish americans call themselves that name so why question what blacks call themselves

829921 we do know we have no systemic problem in this company
829922 i mean we are still probably the safest airline flying around
829923 i am quite sure that things are talked about continual issues cause some reputational damage
829924 it is our job to make sure we get that reputation back
829925 were a very very conservative company we turn back on just about everything and so we should thats the way weve operated over so many years
829926 if you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you but make allowance for their doubting too

829929 i think nanotechnology is the new genetic engineering people just dont know whats going on and its moving so fast
829930 just because something is safe at the macro level doesnt mean its safe at the nano size
829931 american consumers are generally more complacent about genetically modified or cloned foods than their counterparts in europe

829935 with the bank holiday in sydney we are looking to be a little sideways today mr vaughan said
829936 but we see renewed interested in the banks and they should be one or two per cent higher today
829937 while we believe that premiers offer does not adequately recognise the underlying value of just group and its future growth prospects the special board committee acknowledges that in light of the changed circumstances shareholders should accept premiers offer if it achieves acceptances of 50 per cent or more or alternatively sell their just group shares on market just chairman ian pollard said
829938 we believe it is now in just group shareholders best interests for premier to achieve a relevant interest of 90 per cent or greater so that all just group shareholders are able to access the additional 15 cents per share cash consideration and be potentially eligible for capital gains tax scrip for scrip rollover relief dr pollard said
829939 they extended the regular season too long and youve gotta anticipate one or two days of cancellations
829940 it backs up your schedule and theres specific guidelines as to when you have to complete games we didnt get to play north chelmsford and that hurts
829941 i think we have to stop placating the teams that go 12 10 and start focusing on the teams that are at the top of the league
829942 a team like west boylston that gets hot at the right time if their ace beats us we very easily could have lost that series
829943 but if the kids lose interest thats a coaching issue
829944 a lot of guys dont like the playoff because it doesnt give good representation to the state a 500 team could beat a no 1 seed but they cant compete in a three game series
829945 but if you want to talk about everyday play the playoff process works well because it keeps interest
829946 the four or five top teams cant outweigh the 10 or 12 less superior teams
829947 i truly believe each districts trying to do it the right way
829948 we had some extraordinary weather thats the summer but if you cant cover your field and you dont have lights it really creates havoc its gotta be up to that team to not leave many games at the end
829949 its nice that we win but its not the be all end all

829960 adventurous play both challenges and excites children and helps instil critical life skills constantly wrapping children in cotton wool can leave them ill equipped to deal with stressful or challenging situations they might encounter later in life
829961 children both need and want to push their boundaries in order to explore their limits and develop their abilities
829962 we are surprised that the treasury has risked provoking such political opposition for an environmental measure which according to its projections is of limited benefit
829963 that the treasury had not calculated what the impacts of the ved budget changes will be on emissions from second hand cars when this was one of the main objectives of the changes
829964 breeds suspicion about their objectives increasing the perception of them as revenue raising measures with no environmental purpose
829965 however we are seriously concerned that even the projected differentials between ved bands remain too small to be effective and in consequence the projected carbon savings are far less than they could be we also believe that both the proposed changes in ved rates and the objectives of ved as an environmental tax have been poorly explained and communicated
829966 the government has not succeeded in tackling inequality and educational failure
829967 they have spent hundreds of millions of pounds but the poorest children are still extremely unlikely to continue in education after gcses we need to get to the root causes of this inequality and it begins with the need to strengthen relationships and support families
829968 david cameron has already said he cannot guarantee the future of emas under a future conservative government and this latest attempt by michael gove to undermine them suggests they have a secret plan to cut this vital support for students on low and middle incomes
829969 as an independent evaluation from the institute for fiscal studies showed earlier this year ema has been a real success with young people from disadvantaged backgrounds more likely to stay on in education at 16 as a direct result
829970 we will build on this success and from next month every young person on ema will get a firm guarantee of financial support if they go on to university

829977 earlier we had a lot of people coming up to donate but now it seems that people have become tired as time passes
829978 as far as i have noticed private donors have become fewer these days
829979 we are halting our operations for the month of august because of shortage of funds
829980 now that three months have passed donors seem to be tired and are getting back to their usual business so it is difficult to get funds
829981 they private donors and volunteers tend to leave the task of reconstruction to ngo and ingos and seem to think that their role is over
829982 we dont know what to do after this stock of rice is finished
