5150000 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5150001 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5150002 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5150003 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5150004 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5150005 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5150006 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5150007 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5150008 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5150009 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5150010 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5150011 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5150012 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5150013 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5150014 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
5150015 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5150016 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5150017 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5150018 once patients have developed trust in their surgeons they are willing to wait unless their pain becomes unbearable
5150019 in our experiments we explore couplings between atoms in proteins
5150020 our goal is to translate genomic information into high resolution structural information and thereby be able to better understand the function of the proteins
5150021 with increased speed and sensitivity we can obtain very high resolution spectra
5150022 and because we can resolve thousands of signals at a time one for each atom in the sample we can determine the structure of the entire protein
5150023 using this technique we can more precisely define the fragments of the molecule and how they are oriented
5150024 that allows us to define protein features and determine structure at the atomic scale
5150025 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
5150026 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
5150027 the negative and positive implications of wastewater agriculture have only recently received attention
5150028 this study offers the first comprehensive cross country analysis of the conditions that account for the practice and the difficult tradeoffs that arise from it
5150029 of the large potential of wastewater agriculture for both helping and hurting great numbers of urban consumers
5150030 and it isnt just affluent consumers of exotic vegetables whose welfare is at stake
5150031 poor consumers of inexpensive street food also depend on urban agriculture
5150032 a key aim of iwmi research is to find feasible approaches whereby wastewater irrigation can continue strengthening food security and generating economic benefits but without major health risks for urban consumers and farmers
5150033 there were house to house enquiries and a doctor examined her sixty hours of cctv footage were viewed by officers its been extremely costly to essex police
5150034 this is a very unusual case with some history to it
5150035 her ex partner has been harassing her over the past year and her children have been targeted
5150036 we know weve got to be ready its a great start to the season
5150037 oh that one is usually 377 00 your insurance saved you a lot
5150038 holy shit what would we do if we didnt have insurance
5150039 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia

5150041 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
5150042 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno

5150044 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5150045 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5150046 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5150047 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5150048 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5150049 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5150050 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5150051 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5150052 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5150053 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5150054 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5150055 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5150056 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5150057 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5150058 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5150059 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5150060 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5150061 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5150062 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5150063 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5150064 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5150065 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5150066 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5150067 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5150068 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5150069 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5150070 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5150071 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5150072 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5150073 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5150074 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5150075 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5150076 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5150077 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5150078 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5150079 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5150080 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5150081 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5150082 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5150083 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5150084 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5150085 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5150086 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5150087 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5150088 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5150089 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5150090 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5150091 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5150092 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5150093 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5150094 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5150095 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5150096 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5150097 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5150098 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5150099 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5150100 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5150101 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5150102 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5150103 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5150104 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5150105 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
5150106 i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying i have said repeatedly that i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion that was not the bill that was presented at the state level what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe vs wade
5150107 obviously we were really concerned about finding someone to succeed a guy who had been there 31 years keith has done a great job of being aware of the past and also building on it and moving forward
5150108 a very deep and accurate appreciation for who we are and what this community expects of us
5150109 thinking that we have the opportunity to impact the children of this community like this really energizes everyone here
5150110 its what creates the energy and enthusiasm around the work we do it certainly motivates me
5150111 during the last fiscal year we budgeted for tenncare to represent about half of our business
5150112 so its a big piece of our business and growing theres no question that our ability to get compensated for the work we do will influence how aggressive we can be in terms of extending our services further not only to knoxville but throughout east tennessee
5150113 i am generally a pretty optimistic person but if i adopted a slightly pessimistic mood i would say theyre going to want to get more for less and theyre going to hold back more money so they can cover their risks
5150114 we on the other hand view it as were already not getting enough to cover our costs and so to give up even more will be real challenging for us so as we renegotiate those arrangements that will define to some degree how much flexibility were going to have to do some of the things wed really like to do
5150115 weve been pretty aggressive in our partnership with the state to provide education and create opportunities for sign up however weve not seen a big response in terms of either sign up or hospital usage that may change over time
5150116 to be disciplined in the way we prioritize the use of our resources control our expenses manage our contracts with third party payers and when appropriate look to the community for the support they have so graciously provided over the years
5150117 were not a lot different from a lot of other hospitals
5150118 we need to find the best ways to maintain the staff needed to provide the level of care we are providing and want to continue to provide its going to be a challenge to attract subspecialists and build some depth but thats what we intend to do
5150119 as we recruit physicians i have no place to put them
5150120 convenience and access are going to become dominant issues that were going to have to grapple with
5150121 when we talked with our medical staff and the community about deficits in the community theres clearly a sense there is a significant deficit around behavioral health services for kids
5150122 so were going to have to figure out how to tackle that more effectively over the next several years and i dont have a clue exactly how were going do it but were going to jump in and see what we can get done
5150123 he cares deeply about this organization and has been very careful about how and when hes engaged over the last year
5150124 hes done everything he can do to be supportive of me i could not have asked for more
5150125 he knows every operation of the hospital because of his background his education and experience make him an outstanding fit for our hospital
5150126 my personal style is to be open and honest with people ive prided myself on being approachable
5150127 everyone here is deeply respectful of mr koppel and all that he has meant to childrens but they have also been very supportive of me and very willing to consider new ways of doing things its this attitude that makes this such a special place
5150128 its been a very good year ive enjoyed it tremendously it was a very good decision for me to make im happy theyd have to throw me out of here
5150129 its very significant to us because its usually a large portion of our work
5150130 probably the single largest segment of non oak ridge work there is
5150131 even the ability to communicate images into the operating room if you go back years ago you didnt see that
5150132 more and more people are moving to our area from the north and the northeast and in retirement
5150133 honestly those are the people who use hospitals its usually not much young people its people who are older and retired
5150134 i think theyll change how we deliver that care and the environment we deliver that care in
5150135 and i think the other thing is theyll be big consumers of health care
5150136 im all about the love i am responsible for everyone loving one another and wanting to work with each other
5150137 it was so reaffirming to know that baptist is really what were about at st marys and thats continuing the healing mission of jesus i think thats what made our merger so unique
5150138 our goal is for everyone to be happy but we are also realistic enough to know that may not be possible
5150139 you can want people to trust you but trust is something you really earn and so we are consistently working at it
5150140 i mean if you dont like the biscuits in the cafeteria someone is going to answer you
5150141 we will sink or swim as a team if one area is not successful then none of us are successful
5150142 a lot of people who have interest in the waterfront are trying to position themselves for improvement in the credit markets in the next 18 to 24 months
5150143 i think people are starting to see a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel
5150144 theres a few factors that have started to push some things through
5150145 i think i lot of people took note of mercys statement that the downtown baptist site would be its flagship hospital the other thing is the cityview project is now taking form they have the roof on and that helps to let people know that something is going on
5150146 we have spent a lot of time from late spring all the way through the present time working through the first major public investment in infrastructure
5150147 between getting everything from surveys to appraisals to working through a more innovative approach to street design has taken some time
5150148 it was a good announcement from brian and indicative that people are intending to take advantage of the investment the city is willing to make in the public improvements and lends credence to the strategy that we had hoped to use which is not to provide direct subsidies but provide public improvements to serve as a catalyst
5150149 im familiar with washington d c where they take one application and it has some advantages
5150150 but there is a downside for some working people there is a stigma associated with being on tenncare coverkids is a bluecross plan for working people who cant afford insurance in d c where poverty is rampant its one thing but in tennessee people are sensitive to it if an applicant is tenncare eligible we tell them where to go to sign up we get them to the right place
5150151 we are publicizing our 866 number to get people to call in and sign up or they can call in and we will walk them through signing up online
5150152 our staff helps people with the application weve had booths at the offices to help people sign up though its hard sometimes people come in for treatment and dont want to be detained to arrange coverage if we get people signed up it helps us people are going to get the care but next visit we might get paid for it its my understanding the form has been streamlined and should be better
5150153 the language has been changed to be more reader friendly
5150154 we can also help people who call in work through the form if they have the form online we can get them through it in about 15 minutes
5150155 when organizations like cherokee have an open house or a health fair we try to have representatives there to sign people up or arrange for a local social service agency to do it
5150156 we are getting more and more experience operating the program
5150157 call me back a year from now and see how it has improved if there is any comment or criticism out there we want to hear about it
5150158 it gives them skills in abstract ways for problem solving to get results to improve performance
5150159 people just love the experiential learning they really understand what it means to work as part of a team and it really opens their eyes to how much they werent as effective a team player before they showed up
5150160 it is literally the linchpin of the leadership academy that we do
5150161 when you look at the people who are left or whatever work to be done is left folks really need high performance to happen
5150162 finding good players is easy getting them to play as a team is another story
5150163 the thing that can be hard is getting all those people to play together in times like these there is no room for error
5150164 what is different is fewer companies are coming and more nonprofits are coming which i think reflects the times
5150165 when we are running a course there is not even a discussion about cutting mountain challenge our entire team realizes the positive impact
5150166 it is one of the best investments we have made as far as training goes
5150167 we do an end of course critique we work pretty hard to make sure courses are effective and useful and provide good information for folks and mountain challenge always scores the highest on our critique
5150168 we try to learn their language we make sure we know what they want to get out of the mountain challenge experience we really customize everything we do
5150169 you never know whether you are working or playing with mountain challenge
5150170 folks learn a ton of stuff and have a blast the whole time
5150171 to provide a public forum for discussing national state and local policies that may affect the nuclear industry
5150172 its people who are interested in being first in their industry
5150173 theyre interested in the green exposure this will give them
5150174 the solar discussion i would say hasnt been completed yet were kind of in the early stages of that
5150175 the tax credits and the grants really were the impetus to start investigating solar technology
5150176 it made financial sense for us in the same way it also made ethical sense for us because were a company that strives to be green
5150177 thats what im here trying to do trying to meet some people
5150178 everyone here already seems to know each other and i dont know anybody
5150179 i was going to wait for classes to start and then to try to get to know people in my classes i thought that would be easier
5150180 i think some of it is the organization and some of it is the weather

5150182 many of us peace and human rights advocates are rightly reluctant about the use of force we need to get over it there is such a thing as evil in this world and sometimes the only way to confront evil is through the judicious use of military force
5150183 there is such a thing as evil in this world
5150184 i dont know what thats really going to get you he said smiling
5150185 im not feeling all the pressures that would burden my mind the 24 year old first baseman said
5150186 a pitch would come in at 85 mph and itd be by me now if a bad day happens theres always tomorrow
5150187 thats the kind of thing where faith helps he said
5150188 i worried last year and all it got me was demoted from double a to
5150189 i was just swinging away and hoping the ball hit the bat now im more mature and im putting my trust in god hes the reason the balls are going farther
5150190 he said ive got to turn it up a notch

5150192 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5150193 there will be no arrival ceremonies for or media coverage of deceased military personnel returning or departing from ramstein air base or dover air force base
5150194 without a loved one serving in the military it is sometimes possible for americans to overlook the sacrifices that have been made and continue to be made by members of our armed forces on behalf of our nation
5150195 by once again permitting access to accredited members of the media at military commemoration ceremonies memorial services conducted by the armed forces and the arrival of the remains of fallen service members at u s military installations this legislation would honor those who have given their lives in defense of our nation
5150196 if the sun and stars rose in the west would he rescind his post
5150197 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
5150198 the response rate is 10 and we do not calculate refusal rates for zogby interactive polls
5150199 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
5150200 as far as i know we dont publish response and refusal rates we conducted the poll for the associated press youd have to ask them about releasing the response and refusal rates
5150201 we dont have them here from ipsos it takes a little while for them to get those to us i can ask them it shouldnt take too long but normally it takes a few days theyre not secret or anything
5150202 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
5150203 a reasonable approximation for the response rate on the economist wave of august 4 6 would be 43 the opt out rate from our mailings was 4 my best guess at a comparable statistic to refusal

5150207 the feedback gathered from the students research combined with the comments generated from student interviews has helped to confirm our theories of what could make ecampustours com more popular among our target demographic
5150208 the steps we would like to take to appeal to the younger generation do not necessarily match the corporate mind set so by using this information our creative team will be able to more soundly justify existing proposals to senior management
5150209 its a new layer of credibility now we are not only dealing with individual companies in the industry but were dealing with the industry association
5150210 we deal with a lot of companies and make anywhere from 50 000 to 100 000 site visits to atms a year we know that world
5150211 they were looking for somebody that had a national reach we fit the bill
5150212 we hope this introduces us to new owners of atms
5150213 and it may open the door to discussion of other services we can provide for them
5150214 we anticipate 85 000 atms will be signed using the pictogram in the first year with some 20 000 in the u s alone
5150215 we looked hard at the atm industry and did an initiative to expand our business there
5150216 what i learned myself we had a really great run at mastercraft and really increased the value of the business quite a bit was that as just employees we didnt share in those rewards if you can handle the risk and there is great risk in doing your own thing the rewards make it successful
5150217 we were both willing to take a few chances on things here weve had a great run
5150218 and hed be like man the pizza is good today
5150219 i just wanted to make sure i took every single moment in and every single swim in every single moment with my teammates so i would remember them

5150223 pershing yoakley had done some consulting work for us and i also ended up doing some contract work for the firm when we came to see knoxville we are actually living in maryville we just loved the community

5150226 jim has learned throughout the years that sometimes change comes slowly in a political atmosphere or to a school system
5150227 he just needs to keep the kids in mind with his decisions and everything will work out ok
5150228 i just felt like there were some things that hadnt happened that i could work on
5150229 unless youve been in a public school setting you really dont know what they go through
5150230 i wasnt completely satisfied with it and im still not because i think some schools are still suffering with the rezoning
5150231 id rather that someone start out with a full four years rather than have to step in if something did happen
5150232 but we need to be doing some out of the box thinking to keep the kids in the community
5150233 it would be hard to do that working full time
5150234 i look forward to bringing my business experience into the government atmosphere
5150235 its going to be a learning experience for me to learn to be more diplomatic
5150236 i only go to the doctor if i absolutely have to
5150237 just for the surgery room and two nights in the hospital not including medications not including anesthesia not including all the pre op stuff you have to go through was 16 000
5150238 i was just blown away and they would need whatever amount of money up front unless the doctor said it was a medical emergency
5150239 i got my crowns inlays mercury fillings taken out new ones put in for 1 200 i was thrilled
5150240 i looked at mexico but i wasnt able to find something i was confident
5150241 i banged my head against the wall trying to find a way to have it here
5150242 they wanted me to have an mri i went to have the mri that day
5150243 they wanted to check out what caused my pulmonary embolism from 18 years ago
5150244 everything doctors fees all medications nurses private hospital room three night stay 5 800
5150245 why did she have to go to another country leave her daughter for a month
5150246 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
5150247 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
5150248 nobody would tolerate if at the end of meet the press if a bunch of weirdos stormed the studio and started screaming weird racist stuff
5150249 im not sure what good hundreds of thousands of comments or message boards do for anybody
5150250 i have never known anybody to just read through all of that and think its worth revisiting its our job as editors to find a better solution
5150251 i think it will become a crazy memory that a paper like the new york times was letting any dingbat come in and write almost anything on its website

5150304 for nearly a decade i wrote a fictional column in the financial times about a senior manager who spoke almost entirely in business cliches martin lukes talked the talk or rather he added value by reaching out and sharing his blue sky thinking at the end of the day he stepped up to the plate and delivered world class jargon that really pushed the envelope after eight years of being him i came to accept the nouns pretending to be verbs to task and to impact even the new verb to architect i almost took in my stride i didnt even really mind the impenetrable sentences full of leveraging value and paradigm shifts but what still rankled after so long were the little things that he said myself instead of me and that he would never talk about a problem when he could dialogue around an issue instead passion says the dictionary means a strong sexual desire or the suffering of christ at the crucifixion in other words it doesnt really have an awful lot to do with a typical day in the office unless things have gone very wrong indeed and yet passion is something that every employee must attest to in order to get through any selection process

5150316 the patient must utilise the technology usefully in the correct perspective instead of dissection discussion and hair splitting
5150317 the internet which is very useful to most of us can supply ideas to the patient to gain knowledge to pose intelligent questions to the urologist and forget the actual purpose of the visit to the doctor
5150318 the urologist may have a tough time treating such patients successfully and satisfactorily
5150319 the way i look at it if you get something from a doctor you dont like you find a doctor that gives you better options i found another doctor who said id live seven to 20 years so i like that doctor better
5150320 ive missed two of the three games with richmond senior since andrew has been on the varsity
5150321 he tries to be involved as much as he can without being intrusive
5150322 i aspire to be as strong as him and tough in all areas of life
5150323 i knew it drove him crazy to be as uninvolved as he was just going to the games i was happy for him that hes found a way to get a little more satisfaction feeling a part of the team
5150324 he could play linebacker for us but hes sacrificed for the team to play offensive line
5150325 hes a little undersized to be a lineman 6 1 220 but hes tough as nails
5150326 i dont know what level of football he can play but he would be a valuable member of any team because hes that kind of kid
5150327 its important for our family as much as it is for the team
5150328 its a last chance to get a ring im just ready to get going
5150329 im just a dad whos kind of sick whos looking forward to watching his son play
5150330 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
5150331 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
5150332 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment
5150333 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
5150334 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
5150335 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
5150336 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5150337 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5150338 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5150339 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5150340 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5150341 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5150342 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5150343 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
5150344 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
5150345 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
5150346 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
5150347 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5150348 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5150349 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
5150350 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile

5150359 pastor nettle asked me if i wanted to climb the mountain
5150360 i just want to do this and see the orphanages we support through compassion international in tanzania
5150361 the purpose of my climb is to raise awareness and needed financial resources for orphans and vulnerable children due to the hiv aids pandemic compassion international is the organization i am partnering and while i am in tanzania i will be visiting aids compassion cottages and meeting the children firsthand
5150362 the cottages house six to seven children and a couple is hired to care for the children the cottages in the village are refurbished and the children never have to leave their friends or hometown

5150368 the teams combined for 10 runs and 138 pitches in the first two innings which took 74 minutes to play
5150369 hopefully he can watch west coast games like this one all the way though

5150374 there was everyone walking around in their tight shirts and jeans and there i was wearing my floral church dress looking like i was about to go to easter sunday service
5150375 it probably would have been easier to record more mainstream music first
5150376 but whats harder is to get people to envision the former destinys child members as individual artists and not cast me as this church girl just because thats the music i broke out with

5150386 it appears that the federal government is starting to recognise that more staff are needed to get its massive job done cpsu national secretary stephen jones said
5150387 if government is serious about solving some of the countrys biggest challenges it needs to make sure it does not burn out its best talent
5150388 it needs to ensure that it has an adequately funded and properly resourced public service to get the job done
5150389 we encourage the federal government to abandon these arbitrary cuts to public services and ensure there are enough staff to deliver the services that australians expect

5150402 knowing that manny is in the middle of our lineup certainly makes it a little tougher for the other team to take liberties with us
5150403 manny is basically here to make it tougher to get through the middle of the lineup
5150404 when you get kemp on base and manny and jeff are coming up behind you it adds a little more pressure to the pitcher to throw quality pitches to you you dont want to get two guys on and have those two big guys come up and have them come up in rbi situations
5150405 i dont think there is anything that is imminent at this juncture

5150407 youve got to answer to somebody if theres a player that can help a team that youre contending against and you have a chance to keep that from happening
5150408 hmmm i wonder if miffed minion who is a gen y been in the job five minutes and thinks she knows everything has anything useful to say on x i know the decision personally affects her and i certainly dont want to lose her but if only she could see the big picture and understand that unless we make this change we cant keep paying her salary give her a bonus pay her iphone bill have the chrissie party at a swish venue in the city this year so she stops complaining about the pub create a career path for her give her further training opportunities hire someone new so she develops management skills and doesnt have to work so hard provide her with the latest it tools free tea coffee organic fruit cakes on her birthday massages once a month super holiday pay sick pay parental leave pay maternity leave oh how disappointing as expected minion told me her view and couldnt see the big picture at all couldnt even see the small picture all she can think about is herself oh my god now she is going into all the reasons why she isnt happy with the decision and absolutely none of them relate to the business ill try and explain she keeps interrupting with the same old points thats it ive had it doesnt she know what a perilous position the company is in cant she see i havent slept for a month and tomorrow afternoon when she leaves early to drive to the snow doesnt she know where i will be at my accountant getting ready for a review with the bank and my magic bullet is the decision that i have made the decision she is stroppy about cant she shut up cant she see i am about to crack oh god now shes cross with me all i did was tell her not to argue with me it was that or throttle her i am human you know i do have feelings there is only so much a human can take oh shes walked off in a huff what if she leaves shes really very good i really like her spirit it would be so hard to replace her i should apologise but that would probably start her off again bugger it ill suggest drinks at the pub oh she hates the pub maybe a swish hotel but i have to drink less stress is turning me into a grumpy alcoholic look how i lost it theres nothing i can do she probably thinks i am an ego driven lunatic maybe i am but if only she would learn to bite her tongue
5150409 the impact that the continuing israeli occupation and the associated military occupations have had on the lives of ordinary palestinians
5150410 two strains of jewish and christian fundamentalism have dovetailed into an agenda for a vast imperial project to restructure the middle east all further reinforced by the happy coincidence of great oil resources up for grabs and a president and vice president heavily invested in oil
5150411 theres a barrier going up in thirteen days it didnt occur to anyone to give you more notice and once its up anyone they find living in the urban woods will get taken in and left to fend for themselves on the streets i know youve managed really well out here but most of the stewards are on the citys side on this one
5150412 in view of americas determination to set up a missile defense shield in europe the military is reviewing all its plans to give washington an adequate response
5150413 the 40d comes with a ten million pixel cmos sensor with the same sort of dust reduction as the eos 400d an ultrasonic platform which shakes the low pass filter
5150414 with each step up the evolutionary ladder to the eos 40d canon has demonstrated improvements in image quality performance usability and features
5150415 from an image quality point of view the combination of the canon cmos sensor and digic iii processor means equally detailed images at all sensitivities except maybe iso 3200 low noise and a complete lack of unnatural artifacts
5150416 one surprise came from our testing of the cameras dynamic range it delivered a consistently higher range than both the competition and its predecessor the majority of this improvement however was in the shadow range a function we presume of the new 14 bit processing pipeline
5150417 when i first started using the eos 40d a simple description came to mind that this is a well sorted camera it feels well rounded the result of years of evolutionary improvement it delivers in almost every area and it inspires confidence from a usability point of view the viewfinder feels larger ergonomics are good the user interface is clear and easy to learn there are no in use performance issues metering and auto focus show good consistency and the results speak for themselves colorful yet accurate detailed images with low noise even at high sensitivities
5150418 the canon 40d is nominally canons fifth generation d30 d60 10d 20d 30d prosumer dslr in truth though in some cases such as between the 20d to 30d there was little to be seen in terms of either features or performance improvements other than nicer floor mats and dual headlights
5150419 it may be that in the pro market the competition for canons pro level 1d mkiii will not be the new nikons d3 but rather canons own 40d
5150420 thats a question that has to have been keeping canons product planners up at night during the first half of 2007
5150421 the image quality of the 40d is excellent continuing the industry leading results that canon has offered for the past 5 6 years
5150422 im sure that once the major camera testing sites have done their thing there will be lots of charts and graphs to validate this perspective so if these turn your crank wait for them
5150423 the bottom line is that the canon 40d is the most dslr for the money that canon has ever offered certainly in its price range there doesnt seem to be anything that can touch it move up a notch in price though and the forthcoming nikon d300 may well put the squeeze on canons hegemony in the dslr marketplace time will tell and no matter what happens well all benefit from the renewed competition
5150424 the 40d just gets out of your way better and faster than its very similar predecessors with almost identical specs
5150425 the 40d also has more weather sealing than my 5d for instance the cf card door has foam seals while my 5d doesnt
5150426 metering seems smarter instead of having to dial down 2 3 stop in daylight the 40d seems to be happy most of the time at 0 your taste will vary
5150427 the 40d has three memories that store every camera setting
5150428 what became immediately apparent is how fast smooth quiet and refined the 40d is compared to my 5d or the 20d or 30d even if it felt the same the 3
5150429 you aint too bright are ya nothing you posted says a company cannot put profits before anything else
5150430 no you seem to be insinuating that companies cannot put profit at the top of their priorities got news for you genius the oil companies are not hurting anyone the people have the right to not buy their product or find ways to cut down their use of said product
5150431 he stupid no business in the history of mankind has never not put the profit first everything else second businesses are for making money you just waking up from a coma
5150432 in exchange for the charter a corporation was obligated to obey all laws to serve the common good and to cause no harm early state legislators wrote charter laws and actual charters to limit corporate authority and to ensure that when a corporation caused harm they could revoke its charter

5150434 they were skiing in the area when the brother who survived had gone around the side of the ice cornice
5150435 the 22 year old was on top of the ice cornice at that stage when his brother who was below noticed that it was unsafe and called out to him i presume he could see cracks or movement underneath
5150436 and as he attempted to move off the top of the cornice it collapsed underneath him
5150437 he was engulfed in the snow and ice as it swept him down the slope
5150438 sadly ians son tom was killed in an avalanche in the snowy mountains on sunday afternoon

5150441 the situation was getting pretty serious and i knew that the weather was getting worse and i was starting to have to really plan ahead for something dramatic mr cole told network ten today
5150442 i just knew that i had to try and survive to help them out
5150443 i tried to make the right decisions and luckily we got out
5150444 there were a couple of moments where i had to lead them up quite a dangerous avalanche slope and i told them to hang on and when i went up i set an avalanche off and i really feared for their lives but we just had to continue on and try
5150445 literally we were digging ourselves in a hole deeper and deeper and getting buried more and more he said
5150446 i just wanted to try and jot down some of my thoughts and what was happening because i didnt know if wed get out of it and i just wanted to write a record down when i was still sane because in such cold conditions your body starts deteriorating quite quickly

5150513 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5150514 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5150515 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5150516 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5150517 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5150518 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5150519 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5150520 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5150521 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard

5150532 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

5150536 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5150537 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5150538 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5150539 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5150540 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5150541 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5150545 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues

5150547 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5150548 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

5150550 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5150551 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

5150554 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

5150557 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5150558 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5150559 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5150560 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5150561 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5150562 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5150563 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5150564 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5150565 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5150566 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5150567 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5150568 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5150569 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5150570 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package

5150605 there were a couple of moments where i had to lead them up quite a dangerous avalanche slope and i told them to hang on and when i went up i set an avalanche off and i really feared for their lives but we just had to continue on and try

5150608 it appears that the federal government is starting to recognise that more staff are needed to get its massive job done cpsu national secretary stephen jones said
5150609 if government is serious about solving some of the countrys biggest challenges it needs to make sure it does not burn out its best talent
5150610 it needs to ensure that it has an adequately funded and properly resourced public service to get the job done

5150629 some of them come to the y and put in an hour but theyre actually not achieving much with our program at the y we give them homework they get notebooks and this way it gives us the opportunity to chart their progress or lack of
5150630 just got to work hard and keep getting motivated and do what it takes to go to the next level dont be satisfied
5150631 shell work out six or seven hours a day and you can tell
5150632 at first it wasnt fun because i wasnt seeing any improvement but after a while after you see improvement it just makes you want to keep going see how good you can get
5150633 it pushes me harder because shes bigger and stronger and shes better than me so it drives me to play to the best of my fullest potential
5150634 well just like any facet of their life youve got to put in the time and youve got to make the commitment
5150635 were not everywhere all the time and there are only so many officers out on the street at any given time
5150636 whether it be heavy clothes hats things that cover their face anything that would conceal their identity when theres really no reason for it
5150637 theres so secret to police instinct if its suspicious to you and seems odd seems unusual maybe out of place then thats probably what it is if you tell us about it well look into it and we may end up solving a significant crime like in this case
5150638 usually if we can catch someone in that real short time frame and theres enough evidence to link them then a lot of times people dont even have to testify

5150650 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5150651 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5150652 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5150653 georgia will if it wants and it does want to become a member of nato
5150654 i wish peace for my country and for our children we do not want to live in fear
5150655 well whats the different 20 80 they are the same thing
5150656 i rushed to the scene of the explosion to see terrified people running everywhere and women calling for their missing children
5150657 the situation was chaotic and horrible i saw dead bodies wounded people and blood stains on the ground
5150658 all of us stepped into this journey with great faith and great belief that humanity would carry us through from town to town and thats exactly what happened
5150659 for me to walk from leeds to london is probably the single most difficult thing i could ever have imagined
5150660 i still cant quite believe that i have achieved it but i never gave up because of the people that never gave up on me
5150661 weve come on a small journey in the scale of things but a large journey for us of hope of optimism of reconciliation
5150662 the journey to build a better and fairer and more equitable society is a journey we must all continue on relentlessly and continue on together

5150665 we need to pack up and go home and start living a christian life
5150666 people are walking away from sturgis with jesus in their hearts and he is going to begin to change their life
5150667 we have been obedient witnesses in a place that desperately needs it
5150668 im at a different place in my life right now
5150669 its the holy spirits job to draw them and then god to save them we are called to spread the good news thats what we do in sturgis
5150670 and that doesnt count the strengthening of the faith of the volunteers who endure hot weather long hours and little sleep
5150671 were very grateful for the volunteers as we are for those who partner financially with us as we reach out in this unique way to do gods kingdom work
5150672 where can i pray that prayer could you write it down so that i can pray it right now
5150673 i kept thinking about this all day it just wouldnt leave me alone i am ready to pray that prayer
5150674 just 10 minutes ago i received a call from back home my daughter was injured in an accident she has a broken arm and broken bones in her face i am a christian and was asking god to send someone for me to pray with
5150675 we are christians the holy spirit laid it on our hearts to come and pray with you about the evil that wants to stop this ministry
5150676 all of this would not be possible without the volunteers and partners who have taken this ministry from the vision of one leader to a group of leaders to a national level
5150677 folks who are physically not able to be at the rally are obedient witnesses by praying and by giving to the southern baptist convention cooperative program which helped fund this through the north american mission board
5150678 god has called all of us as a family of southern baptists to impact the lostness that we see here in sturgis
5150679 we were able to have a connection with folks in other states by having them go online to sturgisbikegiveaway com this enabled churches and family members to visibly participate by praying they could see ministry happening as it unfolded
5150680 the training has been more effective and we have seen the result of this by the number of people who prayed to receive christ
5150681 the opening advance team was already in place so that new trainees could get right to work we had more seasoned volunteers and with the expanded time that the tent was open we were able to witness to more people
5150682 i saw this years organization had vastly improved the advantage of pre training on e quip and the power of prayer to fight the spiritual warfare made a difference there was a unified presence with the churches biker groups and individuals who volunteered
5150683 being able to see the engagement of the three minute testimony under the tent and the decisions that happen right before you built on the excitement for our group we had six weeks of training before we came up here we wanted to be prepared
5150684 it was exciting to see hearts engaged and the holy spirit change lives right in front of you as you pray with someone that you just met
5150685 volunteers were bending over backwards from the oklahoma chaplains to the f a i t h riders to our dbc family to help wherever needed it was neat to see so many willing to help out
5150686 this year we didnt have to look for opportunities to minister to vendors
5150687 we had vendors that came out of their spaces to ask us to pray with them one guy said where have you been last year you prayed for my business and it was profitable i need you to pray with me this year we could hardly make it down the street without someone stopping us and asking us to pray for them and with them
5150688 i have never won anything like this in my life
5150689 everywhere that i ride on this new bike i will be able to share how this harley was used to win over 1 300 people to christ
5150690 we start in the fall planning for the next years rally
5150691 we reserve the booth space and revise the website volunteers are contacted and sent out packets of information to start the process of scheduling for the booth workers
5150692 they came up with new and creative ideas for this years rally
5150693 the inspiration for a follow up booth came from a prayerwalk on a very cold day when an unused space was up for rent across the street from the ministry tent location
5150694 people are looking for satisfaction like the song from the rolling stones says i cant get no satisfaction and ive tried and ive tried and ive tried only jesus can give you satisfaction
5150695 many months of preparation paid off beginning with what happened on sunday
5150696 i dont know about you but i want to be where gods at
5150697 and there aint no doubt that gods in the house at sturgis
5150698 god doesnt need another riding club there are plenty of those
5150699 god needs people to put feet to the gospel and share christ with folks motorcycle ministry is merely a tool that has been given to us by god to allow us to act out our obedience to him
5150700 your passion could be a motorcycle a fishing rod a golf club or a sewing ministry
5150701 whatever it is you need to be using it to honor the lord
5150702 voc chama isto de mal eu posso te mostrar como as coisas podem realmente ir mal
5150703 voc chama isto de bom ent o vou te mostrar como as coisas podem ficar boas para voc
5150704 whatever you do practice sleeping on time starting a week before trying to sleep at 12pm the night before doesnt work if youve been sleeping at 4am all the time
5150705 we didnt verify their details so they need to call back to verify those details the spokeswoman said
5150706 i have always known that i want to be a social worker
5150707 how did these experiences contribute to your understanding of your own values beliefs etc
5150708 waiting silently is the hardest thing of all but the things that we feel most deeply we ought to learn to be silent about at least until we have talked them over thoroughly with god
5150709 it feels like youre in heaven you can do whatever you want
5150710 but its a good group of kids they havent given me a bit of trouble they get along well together theres no animosity theyre a team and they stick together as a team
5150711 you dont want the kids to get big heads that theyre better than somebody else
5150712 im very very happy that the senators request for a ceasefire has been complied with
5150713 he needs to get a job or she should just leave him
5150714 she needs to just dump his ass and move on
5150715 if it were me and i had to get a job to save my marriage id be all over it
5150716 i got into this race to change the way business is done in washington i said early on that we are not going to take pac money and were not going to take money from federal lobbyists
5150717 i feel like ive been disenfranchised by the candidate and the democratic national committee
5150718 you know a lot of those lobbyists whether you like it or not represent real americans
5150719 when i go to the white house im going to be answerable to you im not going to be answerable to a lot of fat cat donors
5150720 were back bigger and better than before it really is the best series weve done
5150721 im pleased shes done this she really is one of the best ive worked with shes not afraid to speak her mind and most of all she gets it
5150722 its a thank you to our volunteers and as a way for the public to come and see the buildings that we have said marlette pittman and also we have some entertainment and some corn and have a good time

5150736 there were georgian attacks overnight but our troops are in full control of the city so far weve had no orders to move south into georgia
5150737 there was a great wave of pressure which twisted me and flung me against the kitchen wall
5150738 this land is my body my home we are a proud beautiful people and we are not leaving i survived i am alive
5150739 we are raising a toast to those who are left
5150740 those tanks in the street we hit them with rocket propelled grenades from the basement
5150741 the georgians were 30 times stronger than us they wanted to kill us to destroy everything but we held them off
5150742 those who perpetrated this horror are criminals who must be punished by god this war is a result of georgian fascism which has flourished with the support of the west
5150743 is the help we received from russia which do you think we should chose
5150744 ive never heard anything so monstrous as people shelling a hospital
5150745 we managed to escape to the shelter just in time
5150746 the georgians could not get tanks through these narrow streets so first they turned it to ruins with a grad attack and tried to punch through here to the centre of the city there was heavy fighting in the streets i think more than 500 bodies were pulled out of this part of town
5150747 i personally saw one man beheaded lying in the street and others say they witnessed civilians who had been finished off with a shot to the back of the head
5150748 there will be in the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude and producing dictatorship without tears so to speak producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them but will rather enjoy it because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods and this seems to be the final revolution
5150749 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer some virologists believe that this would insure that the man made mutant virus recognizes human cells and knows how to invade them
5150750 a basic virological fact that the public has not been told is that it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist
5150751 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it calls the inevitable bird flu pandemic which they say could kill half or more of all americans and similar numbers of people around the globe
5150752 tyson foods inc has begun killing and burying the carcasses of 15 000 hens from a flock that tested positive for exposure to a strain of the bird flu in northwest arkansas state officials said tuesday
5150753 one of the highest rates of injury and illness of any industry
5150754 dangerous chemicals blood faecal matter exacerbated by poor ventilation and often extreme temperatures workers typically faced hazardous conditions loud noise must work in narrow confines with sharp tools and dangerous machinery
5150755 an experiment mating h5n1 avian flu viruses and a strain of human flu in a laboratory produced a surprising number of hybrid viruses that were biologically fit a new study reveals and while none of the offspring viruses was as virulent as the original h5n1 about one in five were lethal to mice at low doses showing they retained at least a portion of the power of their dangerous parent
5150756 the work suggests that under the right circumstances and no one is clear what all of those are the two types of flu viruses could swap genes in a way that might allow the h5n1 virus to acquire the capacity to trigger a pandemic that process is called reassortment this study is just showing exactly that there is a risk this virus can successfully reassort with a human virus said richard webby director of the world health organizations collaborating centre for influenza research at st jude hospital in memphis tennessee
5150757 terrifying biological weapons capable of killing only people of specific ethnic groups
5150758 the u s government is taking steps to minimize the need to make vaccine allocation decisions by supporting efforts to increase domestic influenza vaccine production capacity significant funding is being provided to develop new vaccine technologies that allow production of enough pandemic influenza vaccine for any person in the united states who wants to be vaccinated within six months of a pandemic declaration
5150759 two injections given 28 days apart may provide limited protection if a pandemic occurs
5150760 if h5n1 does mutate it is unclear if vaccines developed now would still work against a pandemic strain
5150761 three polish doctors and six nurses are facing criminal prosecution after a number of homeless people died following medical trials for a vaccine to the h5n1 bird flu virus
5150762 the spanish flu influenza virus that killed 20 40 million people in 1918 is currently under reconstruction several genes of the extraordinarily lethal 1918 flu virus have been isolated and introduced into contemporary flu strains these proved to be lethal for mice while virus constructs with genes from a current flu virus types had hardly any effect these experiments may easily be abused for military purposes but provide little benefit from a medical or public health point of view
5150763 the 1918 spanish flu was highly infectious and in comparison to contemporary flu viruses killed a very high percentage of those infected including many younger people the spanish flu alone caused the medium life expectancy in the us in 1918 to drop by 10 years hence flu viruses are perceived today as a serious biological warfare threat just two weeks ago a 15 million dollar research grant was awarded in the us to develop protective measures especially against a bioterrorist attack with flu viruses
5150764 despite the very dangerous nature of the 1918 virus efforts to reconstruct it started in the mid 1990s when dr jeffrey taubenberger from the us armed forces institute of pathology in washington dc succeeded in recovering and sequencing fragments of the viral rna from preserved tissues of 1918 victims in the current issue of the scientific journal emerging infectious diseases new genetic details of the 1918 flu virus will be published
5150765 but after partially unravelling the genetic sequence of the virus the scientists went a step further and began bringing the spanish flu back to life unnoticed by the public they succeeded in creating a live virus containing two 1918 genes that proved to be very lethal in animal experiments this experiment is only one genetic step away from taking the 1918 demon entirely out of the bottle
5150766 a resuscitation of the spanish flu is neither necessary nor warranted from a public health point of view
5150767 were tempted to say that nobody in their right mind would ever use these things
5150768 sanofi pasteur the vaccines division of sanofi aventis group announced today that the us department of health and human services hhs has accepted h5n1 bulk vaccine antigen to produce approximately 38
5150769 donate 60 million doses of h5n1 vaccine to the world health organization who over 3 years for the establishment of an h5n1 vaccine global stockpile
5150770 the h5n1 virus is currently circulating in some of the poorest regions of the world and an outbreak of pandemic influenza would most likely hit populations living in areas with limited access to vaccines this donation of h5n1 vaccine aims to address the needs of those most vulnerable populations in addition to supporting the efforts of governments
5150771 it is essential that industry collaborates with international organizations such as who the bill and melinda gates foundation and other global health players
5150772 a disease that turned people the color of wet ashes and drowned them in the fluids of their own bodies and inspired names like the purple death
5150773 the transformation of poultry production in asia in recent decades is staggering in the southeast asian countries where most of the bird flu outbreaks are concentrated thailand indonesia and viet nam production jumped eightfold in just 30 years from around 300 000 metric tonnes mt of chicken meat in 1971 to 2 440 000 mt in 2001 chinas production of chicken tripled during the 1990s to over 9 million metric tons per year
5150774 there will be in the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude and producing dictatorship without tears so to speak producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them but will rather enjoy it because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods and this seems to be the final revolution

5150813 i do think its problematic that they kept semprebon on after finding out about his sex offender status
5150814 this was something we had no knowledge of and when we had knowledge we went directly to police
5150815 you get these in the area but this one was remarkable
5150816 a sizzling noise then there was a sonic boom explosion
5150817 i thought it was glass it turned out to be the plaster from the ceiling
5150818 i thought it was gunfire then i could see a bright flash of light across the street
5150819 it was huge and then it went back down into the ground
5150820 i was about to get everyone down into the basement

5150832 its way too early to know which if any of these technologies is going to be practical
5150833 but its important for us to get ahead of the curve soldiers are always on the cutting edge of new technologies
5150834 in situations where it is important to win the hearts and minds of the local populace it would be useful to know if they understand the information being given them
5150835 its also important to develop antidotes and protective agents against various classes of drugs
5150836 how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands
5150837 i think most reasonable people if they imagine a world in which all sides have figured out how to control brains theyd rather not go there
5150838 most rational human beings would believe that if we could have a world where nobody does military neuroscience well all be better off but for some people in the pentagon its too delicious to ignore
5150839 there will be in the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude and producing dictatorship without tears so to speak producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them but will rather enjoy it because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods and this seems to be the final revolution
5150840 the nypds latest plan to track and monitor the movements of millions of law abiding people is an assault on this countrys historical respect for the right to privacy and the freedom to be left alone that this is happening without public debate and that elected officials have had no opportunity to study this program is even more alarming
5150841 nyclu nypd plan to track millions of law abiding people is an assault on privacy rights
5150842 city would photograph every vehicle entering manhattan and sniff out radiation

5150845 urging the creation of a london style surveillance system for the financial district that relies on license plate readers movable roadblocks and 3 000 public and private security cameras below canal street all linked to a coordination center at 55 broadway known as the lower manhattan security initiative the center is to open in september
5150846 could not say when the program operation sentinel would be completed
5150847 the lower manhattan initiative is expected to be in place by 2010
5150848 it is one tool of ensuring that if there is somebody on a terrorist watch list or someone driving erratically or if a pattern develops that raises suspicions it gives them an opportunity to investigate further and if need be track down the drivers or the passengers
5150849 the bottom line is they cant frisk everybody coming into manhattan they cannot wand everyone as they do at airports this is a passive collection of data that is not as personally invasive as what they do at airports

5150851 i think its imperative that the following step be taken
5150852 t he banking problems in the united states continue to mount while the federal governments deficit continues to soar out of control so what happened to cause the dollar to rally over the past three weeks in a word
5150853 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars
5150854 on july 16 2008 the federal reserve reported holding 2 349 billion of us government paper in custody for central banks in its report released today this amount had grown over the past three weeks to 2 401 billion

5150862 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that some day there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects
5150863 experiments indicate that the advantages of these devices are such that human operators will be greatly enhanced for things like photo reconnaissance and so on
5150864 in the intelligence community there is an extremely small number of people who understand the science and without that its going to be impossible to predict surprises this is a black hole that needs to be filled with light
5150865 were not going to be reading minds at a distance but that doesnt mean we cant detect gross changes in anxiety or fear and then subsequently talk to those individuals to see whats upsetting them

5150867 reinforce decorum and prevent damage to public parks and gardens
5150868 reminiscent of benito mussolinis edict of the 1920s which banned groups of five or more people
5150869 there is no emergency situation here in novara and there is no need for fascist edict there are other better ways to tackle the citys problems

5150873 we live in a world hardened and distorted by hate we communicate in the language of fear and violence human beings are no longer viewed as human beings they are no longer endowed in our eyes or the eyes of those who oppose us with human qualities they do not love grieve suffer laugh or weep they represent cold abstractions of evil the death for death means we communicate by producing corpses
5150874 i told you once that i was searching for the nature of evil i think ive come close to defining it a lack of empathy its the one characteristic that connects all the defendants a genuine incapacity to feel with their fellow man evil i think is the absence of empathy
5150875 as ye would that men should do to you do ye also to them likewise
5150876 none of you truly believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself
5150877 hurt no one so that no one may hurt you
5150878 what is hateful to yourself do not do to your fellow man that is the whole torah the rest is just commentary
5150879 if it takes 10 years blow them all away in the name of the lord
5150880 we should invade their countries kill their leaders and convert them to christianity
5150881 why should we hear about body bags and deaths oh i mean its not relevant so why should i waste my beautiful mind on something like that
5150882 civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy the process of setting man free from men

5150888 one thousand u s troops began a military training exercise in georgia on tuesday against a backdrop of growing friction between georgia and neighbouring russia
5150889 the main purpose of these exercises is to increase the cooperation and partnership between u s and georgian forces
5150890 the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century
5150891 commitment to georgia and americas allies in the former soviet sphere

5150893 the dod the nations biggest polluter is now cleaning up 29 500 currently or formerly contaminated sites in every state and territory california alone has 3 912 contaminated sites on 441 current and former dod installations many of dods facilities have already contaminated groundwater sources of drinking water the cost to clean up toxic munitions contamination and unexploded ordnance at active and former military installations around the country may reach 200 billion
5150894 the defense department is refusing to comply with orders or sign contracts to clean up 11 hazardous waste sites including one in hawaii and has asked the white house and justice department to intervene on its behalf
5150895 large numbers of corroding depleted uranium penetrators embedded in the ground might pose a long term threat if the uranium leaches into water supplies
5150896 long term environmental sampling particularly of water and milk is required and provides a cost effective method of monitoring sensitive components of the environment and of providing information about uranium levels to concerned local populations monitoring may need to be enhanced in some areas by site specific risk assessment if the situation warrants further consideration
5150897 offer strong evidence of the correlation between low level radiation exposure and result ing health damages
5150898 a shift of leukemia incidence rates towards younger children during the recent years
5150899 in aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to du
5150900 the chemical risks of breathing in uranium dust are so low that it wont cause any long term health risks
5150901 radioactive material and waste will not be locally disposed of through burial submersion incineration destruction in place or abandonment without approval from overall commander
5150902 if local disposal is approved the responsible commander must document the general nature of the disposed material and the exact location of the disposal
5150903 the fire and explosions damaged or destroyed 102 vehicles including four m1a1 tanks and numerous other combat vehicles more than two dozen buildings sustained damage as well among the estimated almost 15 million in damaged or destroyed ammunition were 660 m829 120mm du sabot rounds
5150904 personnel packing the drums with du penetrators wore surgeons caps safety glasses half face protective masks coveralls butyl rubber aprons rubber surgeons gloves with cotton inserts and rubber booties over their normal work boots a total of eight drums were filled with about 250 du penetrators
5150905 under the circumstances the army had no legal obligation to clean up the particulate material
5150906 the soil is not regulated as radioactive material by the us department of transportation
5150907 the army is responsible for characterizing the material for the purposes of complying with transportation and disposal requirements the epa does not have a specific standard related to depleted uranium for the purposes of disposal depleted uranium is considered a low level radioactive waste and is subject to u s nuclear regulatory commission regulations
5150908 the sand with small amounts of depleted uranium being sent to the u s ecology idaho facility for disposal contains exempt concentrations of uranium less than 0 5 percent weight if the concentrations were greater than this we would have oversight
5150909 during my entire tour one could say that i was in the loop in the know about operations
5150910 my notes from all of the meetings we had and we had meetings twice a day every day and many times having a meeting or two in between i can still not find one mention of potential health hazards from depleted uranium or the possible contamination of any area at camp doha
5150911 i have what they call ibs irritable bowel syndrome but theyve not been able to treat it with any success it creates constant bad bad cramping in the lower abdomen severe fatigue bad joint pain all of the norms rolled up into the gulf war illness tag
5150912 as for what i believe is the cause of my declining health
5150913 there were three constants when i arrived a doha there were the burning oil well fires there was a constant presence of insects pesticides and then there was the du ive always believed that there is more to the du than the us government and dod would like us to believe
5150914 young childrens exposure to depleted uranium must be monitored and preventive measures taken and heavily affected impact zones for depleted uranium munitions should be cordoned off and cleaned up
5150915 doctors in afghanistan say rates of some health problems affecting children have doubled in the last two years some scientists say the rise is linked to use of weapons containing depleted uranium du by the u s led coalition that invaded the country in 2001 a canadian research group found very high levels of uranium in afghans during tests just after the invasion a u s forces spokesman denied its weapons were affecting the health of afghans or the countrys environment
5150916 ever since its use by the allied forces in the first war against iraq there have been serious concerns about the radiological and chemical toxicity of the fine uranium particles produced when such weapons impact on hard targets concerns have also been expressed about the contamination of soil and groundwater by expended rounds that have missed their targets and their implications for civilian populations despite the fact that scientific research has so far been unable to find conclusive evidence of harm there are numerous testimonies as to the harmful and often deadly effects on both military personnel and civilians the last few years have seen great advances in terms of understanding the environmental and health hazards posed by depleted uranium and whereas it is high time that this was reflected in international military standards as they develop the use of depleted uranium in warfare runs counter to the basic rules and principles enshrined in written and customary international humanitarian and environmental law
5150917 there is no reliable scientific or medical evidence to link du with the ill health of either gulf or balkans veterans or people living in these regions many independent reports have been produced and researchers continue to consider the battlefield effects of using du munitions these reports include work by the royal society the european commission the united nations environment programme unep and the world health organization who none of these organizations has found a connection between du exposure and illness and none has found widespread du contamination sufficient to impact the health of the general population or deployed personnel
5150918 to undertake every measure possible to ensure that depleted uranium weapons of mass destruction are banned forever
5150919 belgium has banned the use of uranium in all conventional weapon systems however at least 18 countries including the u s use depleted uranium in their arsenals they are considered weapons of mass destruction under international law according to a canada u s agreement canadian uranium exports may only be used for peaceful purposes
5150920 because natural uranium in the general environment is mostly in large particles created from natural weathering processes the body seems to be able to eject these but weapons uranium dust is formed at very high temperature into ultra fine particles described as aerosols that can pass through cell walls etc in the lungs these will go into soft tissue and stay there rather than being coughed out
5150921 have accumulated many types of waste and contamination over the years the federal government estimated its environmental liability to clean up this waste at 249 billion in fiscal year 2004 representing the federal governments third largest reported liability it represents a significant future outflow of funds at the same time as many other competing demands for federal dollars but is currently not auditable

5150923 the air and artillery bombardment left the provincial capital without water food electricity and gas horrified civilians crawled out of the basements into the streets as fighting eased looking for supplies
5150924 it all confirms our numerous warnings addressed to the international community that it is necessary to pay attention to massive arms purchasing by georgia during several years now we see how these arms and georgian special troops who had been trained by foreign specialists are used
5150925 russia has already begun consultations with the ambassadors of the nato countries and consultations with nato military representatives will be held tomorrow
5150926 we will caution them against continuing to further support of saakashvili
5150927 it is an undisguised aggression accompanied by a mass propaganda war
5150928 start military action against abkhazia however the abkhaz fortified region turned out to be unassailable for georgian armed formations therefore a different tactic was chosen aimed against south ossetia which is more accessible territorially

5150930 some powerful weapons through the upgrade of su 25 planes and artillery systems in israel
5150931 claiming that us as well as nato and israeli military assistance to georgia is destabilizing the region
5150932 georgia has received 206 tanks of which 175 units were supplied by nato states 186 armored vehicles 126 from nato 79 guns 67 from nato 25 helicopters 12 from nato 70 mortars ten surface to air missile systems eight israeli made unmanned aircraft and other weapons in addition nato countries have supplied four combat aircraft to georgia the russian defense ministry said there were plans to deliver to georgia 145 armored vehicles 262 guns and mortars 14 combat aircraft including four mirazh 2000 destroyers 25 combat helicopters 15 american black hawk aircraft six surface to air missile systems and other arms
5150933 said there were no plans to redeploy the estimated 130 us troops and civilian contractors who he said were stationed in the area around tblisi

5150936 turkey and israel are negotiating the construction of a multi million dollar energy and water project that will transport water electricity natural gas and oil by pipelines to israel with the oil to be sent onward from israel to the far east
5150937 baku oil can be transported to ashkelon via this new pipeline and to india and the far east
5150938 ceyhan and the mediterranean port of ashkelon are situated only 400 km apart
5150939 georgian casualty figures ranged from 82 dead including 37 civilians to a figure of around 130 dead a russian air strike on gori a georgian town near south ossetia left 60 people dead many of them civilians georgia says

5150954 was not meant to be won leading to the restoration of georgian sovereignty over the province it was intended to destabilize the region while triggering a us nato confrontation with russia

5150956 commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia
5150957 spread to georgias second breakaway province of abkhazia where separatist rebels and the russian air force launched an all out attack on georgian forces
5150958 we do not intend to take the initiative in escalating the conflict in this region we are primarily interested in
5150959 russian president dmitri medvedev ordered a halt to military action in georgia today saying it had punished the country and brought security for civilians and russian peacekeepers
5150960 seized a georgian military base and also held onto ground in western georgia maintaining control of the town of zugdidi
5150961 russia accused georgia of killing more than 2000 people mostly civilians in south ossetia
5150962 because large areas of georgia are too dangerous for journalists to enter to assess the true scope of the damage
5150963 foolishly and tragically baited the russians or even more foolishly fell into moscows trap
5150964 bull ying and blackmail ing its neighbors and its own people
5150965 shoulder ing aside medvedev to run the war and appears determined to reimpose by force and intimidation as much of the old soviet sphere of influence as he can get away with
5150966 must tell mr putin in the clearest possible terms that such aggression will not be tolerated
5150967 need to take a hard look at their relationship with russia going forward russia needs to behave responsibly and the united states and europe must make clear that anything less is unacceptable
5150968 stand together and make clear that this aggression will not stand
5150969 the west can no longer stand idle while the russian bully wreaks havoc
5150970 russian policy as uniquely destructive in generating instability and political division in the caucasus
5150971 georgias role in maintaining the only east west pipeline route free of russias monopolistic grip
5150972 the war in georgia is a war for the west
5150973 waging all out war on my country thats not of georgias making nor its choice the kremlin designed this war its a war about georgias independence and future and about the future of freedom in europe
5150974 rush ing military and medical supplies to tbilisi and washington should lead

5150982 there is a full investigation under way to find out who is behind this
5150983 a significant number of unauthorized transactions had been made using wells fargos codes
5150984 we are doing everything in our power to make sure this doesnt happen again
5150985 i think youve gotten a serious black eye today we were finally getting management happy with the idea of using esx for production servers and this set us back
5150986 this will cast doubt about the reliability of vmware in the enterprise
5150987 love what you do and become and expert in it
5150988 youve got to get three outs you know no matter whos out there pitching youve got to get three outs
5150989 there can be several factors the climate there an early and late frost road salt on the downslope and the array of trees that are there
5150990 theres not a good environment for them to get well he said
5150991 trees that are under stress dont grow as long into the season
5150992 its not the end of the world its just that it shows up there in the notch
5150993 he just made some mistakes early in the game and the guys hit him
5150994 otherwise that doesnt happen to him too often some days that happens
5150995 whenever you have a chance to get those pitchers out of the game quick its good to get to their bullpen and work their bullpen
5150996 it was a good day for everybody i guess that gave us a little more confidence
5150997 the fastballs he threw ran back over the middle they were elevated
5150998 we spent the majority of the day doing that they were pretty consistent in scoring
5150999 the way we came out swinging the bats against beckett today is a big lift for us
5151000 i think we thought today was going to be one of those games where one or two runs was going to be tough to come by to have our guys set the tone early was a big lift
5151001 my general sense is that its a higher number than ive had in other schools
5151002 we wont have as many juniors and seniors because quite honestly by the time kids get to junior senior year theyve kind of figured high school out a little bit and they get a little bit better at it
5151003 i think proportionally it will be smaller as we move forward
5151004 theres a old saying that students rise to the level of expectations and if you raise expectations students performance is going to rise along with your increased expectations and i think thats really true
5151005 it is going to be the biggest blood drive ever held in the state of new hampshire
5151006 you know what i love about the blood drive you dont have to be wealthy you dont have to have money rich or poor you can give and make a difference
5151007 we had an opportunity to pick up some property with great visibility and a great location in concord
5151008 its one of those opportunities that you dont get very often
5151009 the front end of the old woodman building the historic building will be largely left as it is today
5151010 in the second half belgium played poorly and we played better

5151247 ive been around for a while i was used to this defense i think i can contribute
5151248 right now were just evaluating this thing day to day there are so many things that can happen between now and when we have to make that roster cut that its a pure waste of time to speculate on those at this point people could get hurt so forth and so on
5151249 as always the coverage kind of dictates where the ball goes its not like ive taken a lot of snaps so far so im not really concerned about it
5151250 thats definitely a good thing if we use everybody and spread the ball around well be that much tougher to defend and thats definitely our goal as an offense
5151251 were looking forward to putting this phase of our team building behind us
5151252 he played for how many plays after that so chances are he could have you still want to always be able to protect yourself so thats always kind of the litmus for us
5151253 well just see how he feels throwing tomorrow if he can
5151254 from my standpoint i think hes going to be just fine
5151255 yeah it is ive just been going to meetings and watching practice like a coach im a football player not a coach not a cheerleader
5151256 hes one of our best players he just means that
5151257 he has that burst and he gets the ball on the ground and instead of a 20 yard gain its a 7 yard gain and at the end of the season that adds up to a lot of yards hes a valuable guy
5151258 yeah i do but i dont want to play in the sense that like you said if i cant be myself you know what i mean the way i see things as soon as they put me on the field im like shut up let me practice the new play dont take me out of the game thats always every preseason football players mind set its like oh man preseason and once you get in the game dont take me out you know
5151259 i dont think people understand last year we could have been the best defense in the history of football statistically
5151260 i was thinking about our defense and the evolution of our defense we were very simple when coach lebeau came in as time progressed things started getting a little more complex hes doing a lot more things with us which has made us a better defense
5151261 everybody knows hes somewhat of a catalyst for our defense
5151262 before you know it everybodys going to forget about this little camp
5151263 whoa did you see that how does a young girl take her body and make it bend like that
5151264 a nation should require all its students to study the same national curriculum until they enter college rather than allow schools in different parts of the nation to determine which academic courses to offer
5151265 in order to improve the quality of instruction at the college and university level all faculty should be required to spend time working outside the academic world in professions relevant to the courses they teach
5151266 education encourages students to question and criticize and therefore does little to promote social harmony
5151267 all students should be required to take courses in the sciences even if they have no interest in science
5151268 universities should require every student to take a variety of courses outside the students field of study because acquiring knowledge of various academic disciplines is the best way to become truly educated
5151269 some educational systems emphasize the development of students capacity for reasoning and logical thinking but students would benefit more from an education that also taught them to explore their own emotions
5151270 students should bring a certain skepticism to whatever they study
5151271 both parents and communities must be involved in the local schools
5151272 society should identify those children who have special talents and abilities and begin training them at an early age so that they can eventually excel in their areas of ability
5151273 a nation should require all its students to study the same national curriculum until they enter college rather than allow schools in different parts of the nation to determine which academic courses to offer
5151274 society should identify those children who have special talents and abilities and begin training them at an early age so that they can eventually excel in their areas of ability
5151275 afghanistan has to try to have good relations with you but if your government continues a reversed policy the afghans will be obliged to kill your nationals in revenge for their brothers their sisters and their children events such as logar will happen again because occupied afghanistan looks at all actors that are established in the interest of america with an eye of hostility therefore you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans the canadian people have to realize if their sisters their brothers and their children are being killed in afghanistan it is because of the wrong policy of the government of canada and their falling under the influence of others when they sent occupation soldiers to afghanistan the canadian people when they express condolences for the death of two canadian women in logar in afghanistan and consider themselves grieved they have to know that the canadian forces under american command handicap tens among the afghan people every day to this kind of condolence and they kill in addition to men numbers of women and children as well the afghans did not go to canada to kill the canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghan to please the fascist regime of america your government did not take into account the national interests of canada and did not follow a neutral policy it sacrificed its national and international respect and standing in service of the interests of america

5151277 most people dont have signs and symptoms in the early stages of liver cancer which means the disease may not be detected until its quite advanced
5151278 primary liver cancer is rarely discovered early and often doesnt respond to current treatments

5151282 the elders have told us to pray in this manner and that manner and it is important that we only pray as we have been taught for this has been handed down to us by the elders
5151283 our mothers have said to go this building and that building and pray in this manner and that manner and our fathers have said to bow in this manner and that manner when we pray and it is important that we do only this when we pray
5151284 our teachers have told us to sit in this manner and that manner and to say this thing and that thing when we pray and it is important that we do only this when we pray
5151285 our book has told us to pray in this way and that way and to do this thing and that thing and it is very important that we do this when we pray
5151286 yes a special gift for each one but the people were so busy speaking and arguing about which way is right they could not see the gift i gave each one of them

5151289 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5151290 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5151291 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5151292 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5151293 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5151294 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5151295 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5151296 effective leadership is putting first things first effective management is discipline carrying it out
5151297 we should take care not to make the intellect our god it has of course powerful muscles but no personality it cannot lead it can only serve
5151298 i can tell things arent all right so i need to get to the bottom of this pretty quickly so we can get on with the business of the business
5151299 333333 managers and employees seemed to want to avoid these
5151300 333333 the culture of an organization has to evolve with the changing marketplace
5151301 333333 david kolb 6 demonstrated in the 1980s that adults cannot learn to behave in a desirable way just by listening to instructions
5151302 it employs 64 000 people directly and according to some estimates half that many again indirectly
5151303 it generates demand spill overs linkages and capacities that stimulate activity across the economy
5151304 it is critical not only to south australia and victoria but to the whole country
5151305 thats why we must attract new investment to secure its future
5151306 the car industry has been driving innovation in australia since the first holden rolled off the production line in 1948
5151307 shall the county enact an ordinance to increase real estate taxes in order to repeal the alcoholic drink tax
5151308 this is the first step in challenging that whole process that they went through to put a referendum question on the ballot
5151309 the lawsuit is an attempt to reverse the power they gave themselves they are circumventing the county charter
5151310 the administrative code requires us to return the petition to fact
5151311 we have a problem with the wording of the anti drink tax referendum question it simply asks the voter to make a decision if they want lower taxes
5151312 im a christian and im going to love and care for you

5151319 for years now warner music has been offering a choice to consumers at apples itunes store the option to purchase something more than just single tracks which constitute the mainstay of that stores sales by packaging a full album into a bundle of music with ringtones videos and other combinations and variation we found products that consumers demonstrably valued and were willing to purchase at premium prices and guess what weve sold tons of them and with apples co operation to make discovering accessing and purchasing these products even more seamless and intuitive well be offering many many more of these products going forward you need to look no further than apples iphone to see how fast brilliantly written software presented on a beautifully designed device with a spectacular user interface will throw all the accepted notions about pricing billing platforms and brand loyalty right out the window and let me remind you the genesis of the iphone is the ipod and itunes a music device and music service that consumers love
5151320 we may throw the dice but the lord determines how they fall
5151321 christians have too long allowed non christians to dominate the imagined world of role playing which was originally inspired by christian men like j r r tolkien and c s lewis not to mention dante john bunyan and john milton and that its time to be a creative force in role playing and other forms of faming for the true author of all creativity and imagination almighty god himself
5151322 so youre going to reject someone because you dont like gaming
5151323 okay then what about you guys that like to play risk or axis and allies are you glorifying war or monopoly so you glorify greed
5151324 okay if you really want to torture your prisoner for information when theres no real need to you can do that but it will come back on you
5151325 if shed kept her damn legs shut it wouldnt have happened
5151326 if she has an abortion its making her the agressor shes no longer the victim
5151327 the formula of this law is do what thou wilt
5151328 do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law
5151329 is a general statement or definition of sin or error
5151330 consist ing primarily in an alienation from ones instincts a splitting off of consciousness from certain basic facts of the psyche
5151331 thelemites are thrice born 4 we accept everything for what it is without lust of result without insisting upon things conforming with a priori ideals or regretting their failure to do so we can therefore enjoy all things of sense and rapture according to their true nature
5151332 take your fill and will of love as ye will when where and with whom ye will
5151333 we have no right to interfere with any type of manifestation of the sexual impulse on a priori grounds
5151334 it should be abundantly clear from the foregoing remarks that each individual has an absolute and indefeasible right to use his sexual vehicle in accordance with its own proper character and that he is responsible only to himself
5151335 sex repression leads to neurosis and is the cause of social unrest
5151336 sexual desire is a basic biological urge drive or instinct which demands satisfaction
5151337 if the male sexual drive is denied legitimate outlets it will find satisfaction in illegitimate ones
5151338 repression of sexual desire may lead to physical or mental illness especially neurosis in women
5151339 the need for sex is as basic as the need for food
5151340 repression of the natural satisfaction may result in addition to secret and dangerous vices which destroy their victim because they are artificial and unnatural aberrations
5151341 it is no longer possible to say a priori that a given action is wrong each man has the right and an absolute right to accomplish his true will
5151342 in reality good and evil are not different from each other
5151343 im stuck here i think this book is too big for me i dont know what to do

5151359 so tell me how long do you think you can go before you lose it all before they call you bluff and watch you fall i dont know but id like to think i had control at some point but i let it go and lost my soul sit tight but the revolutions years away im losing faith and im running low on things to say so i guess i have no choice but to regurgitate the tired anthem of a loser and a hypocrite oh to have died that night i realized it wouldnt last our days were numbered and the reaper tipped the hourglass the final mayday of our sinking ship had come and passed oh to the west you dont know what it is youre running from and everybodys laughing loud your last chance to make your mother and your father proud

5151365 just refresh yourself from your history of anthropology class you took as an undergrad
5151366 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
5151367 not all the large changes seen in arctic climate in recent years are a result of long term trends associated with global warming
5151368 very well if that is all of todays business then i would like to adjourn until our next meeting in four months hopefully we can try to implement everything we have discussed and accomplished here today in the given time
5151369 if you keep this up even a dwarf will be able to sneak up on you
5151370 forgive me gandalf theres just a lot on my mind
5151371 and what frightens me the most is they are more vivid than the ones several nights past elrond continued in a fretful tone
5151372 why all of a sudden would i be having these dreams
5151373 elrond my dear friend we have known each other for many ages i for one can tell you without any doubt you are not losing your mind you are strong in wisdom as you are in spirit and whatever is troubling you can be dealt with this i can assure you
5151374 forgive us elrond we did not mean to intrude upon your conversation with gandalf
5151375 we have come to help you in your time of need
5151376 elrond you sleep but you dont rest you are more pensive than usual and you are hardly ever present at meal times
5151377 something is obviously eating at you and we want to help
5151378 celeborns right so why dont you tell us what is wrong
5151379 my dear friend you have been there for us for many times throughout your life without asking for anything in return please for the sake of this poor old hobbits soul allow me to repay your kindness and long friendship with a simple act of seeing you through your troubled times
5151380 my dear bilbo baggins how can i refuse a compassionate plea like that besides if it wasnt you to make such a plea it wouldve been celeborn
5151381 he knows i would elrond is kin after all and i know when certain situations really bother him
5151382 not to mention bilbo that he is not known to crack under pressure
5151383 nor will he ever admit that there might be something bothering him hence the constant reminders that were here for him
5151384 not to mention the looks and general attitude that he has when faced with a personal crisis
5151385 alright alright you win theres no point in arguing with you all
5151386 elrond how long has it been since my angel departed for the undying lands
5151387 far too long for my liking if you ask me
5151388 it has been 506 years today i wish she where here right now
5151389 slow down erestor breathe i dont need you fainting on me
5151390 redhorn gate roughly twenty minutes away from here there are a number of causalities that were brought here and are being attended to in the house of healing
5151391 ive already sent out a search party for any survivors master
5151392 erestor theres no need to apologise go fetch some more supplies from the stores quickly now
5151393 adar this is horrifying ive never witnessed anything like this in my whole life
5151394 who would you say is the leader or at least coherent enough to try and explain what happened
5151395 so far thirteen there were seventeen unfortunately four have died
5151396 bilbo and i will see if erestors been successful with collecting supplies and also bring more water
5151397 aiya you made it out alive oh thank elbereth youre alive but
5151398 you were trapped far too deep within the caves to and yet here you are
5151399 one can only hope my friend his wounds are very deep but i will try my best to make sure that he does
5151400 did you just see the look on adars face just now
5151401 yes i did it was something unreal somehow the young one claims to have met your father have you seen him from anywhere
5151402 grandfather glorfindel there were at least thirty more people trapped inside now only a few remain behind
5151403 i have been in many battles that were not as bad as this but i have not seen this much carnage since
5151404 it is all right my son the important thing now is that we continue to rescue the survivors and retrieve the deceased to give them a proper burial come now
5151405 my lord all but one of the victims are accounted for but we have a slight problem
5151406 what do you mean one person left inside and now you find a problem
5151407 the lone survivor is trapped between two orcs and the cave wall so far he has been doing his best holding them back three other archers and myself have been trying feverishly to remove some of the loose stones so we can get a better shot at these fowl beasts and not injure the one left inside
5151408 not much further my lord we should be there momentarily
5151409 now there is only one of you foul beasts left
5151410 we have to burn the carcasses just in case there are more orcs close by
5151411 pile the carcasses in there and then lets get back to imladris
5151412 pass the young one to me i will be able to have a tighter hold on him riding back
5151413 ro there is no doubt in all of my being that you are a swift and strong rider but the weight of this young one along with your exhaustion i dont need either of you risking a fall
5151414 i know youre right i just wonder if we could have done more maybe if we got here a little sooner maybe we could have saved more lives
5151415 we did what we had to do no more no less pen neth i do not think it would have mattered much if we arrived before these poor souls were being attacked unfortunately the reality of this tragedy is it happened and it is up to us to help them get back on their feet sounds cold i know and i am truly sorry but unless we do something to end this needless slaughter then it is going to keep happening
5151416 it is hard to say but the main thing is he is still breathing
5151417 glory i cannot help but think of the things racing through young elrohirs mind right now
5151418 i am not sure if there is enough room in the healing house for everyone so i will make arrangements for some of the spare rooms in the main house
5151419 i will go and ask the cook if he has anything ready for these unfortunate souls they must be starving
5151420 son take your brother inside your sister will be waiting for you
5151421 elrond you had better take care of this young one yourself
5151422 i am sorry master i dont mean to stare but if i did not know any better
5151423 obviously it is not i thr mir though some would disagree
5151424 a doppelganger is a twin of sorts everyone is said to have an exact duplicate of them self in the world but for me that is next to impossible since i already have a twin
5151425 the wounds seem to be rather deep i hope there is not too much damage
5151426 i will be back soon i want to check in on the others and see how they fare some of them are physically shaken by this ordeal and will need counselling
5151427 remember child you did a great deed here today do not let the sorrow of this tragedy bring you down things will turn out for the best and before you know it when the young one has completely mended you two might just become fast friends
5151428 ro would you please sit here i want to take a look at your arm
5151429 he looks so peaceful adar i hope that he will make it
5151430 i just wish i could get his breastplate off i want to see what other damage it hides
5151431 it is all right ada ro and i can handle this for you just have a sit down for a few minutes
5151432 dan do not squish the poor guy he has been through enough today
5151433 i am not trying to squish him i am trying to hold him still
5151434 out of all the people that you have rescued and sent here i have been bitten by at least five of them and there is no way i want to be bitten again
5151435 dan if you must sit over the wounded try sitting on your knees hmm
5151436 ro hold him still i am going to attempt to remove the plate
5151437 perhaps it is from a previous wound maybe we should tend to that as well
5151438 i was working on him but the twins took over i really should take over but they are doing so well it would be a shame to take this away from them
5151439 gildor would you please come hold his feet i am going to attempt to take off what appears to be an old bandage and we do not need him bucking around
5151440 he means try to take the wrappings off in one motion that way there is less bruising
5151441 come now boys it is only a body not that different from yours or mine
5151442 for the sake of the valar ro find something to cover her chest i do not think that she would be very comfortable knowing there is a room full of men staring at her
5151443 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5151444 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5151445 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5151446 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5151447 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5151448 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5151449 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5151450 barangsiapa yang menuntut ilmu yang pelajari hanya karena allah i sedang ia tidak menuntutnya kecuali untuk mendapatkan mata benda dunia ia tidak akan mendapatkan bau sorga pada hari kiamat
5151451 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5151452 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5151453 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5151454 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5151455 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5151456 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5151457 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5151458 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5151459 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5151460 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5151461 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5151462 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5151463 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5151464 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5151465 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5151466 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5151467 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5151468 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5151469 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5151470 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5151471 virtually every american city including kauai and the big island accept credit cards for payment of real property taxes and i think its about time the city and county of honolulu enter the 21st century and also accept credit cards honolulu city councilman charles djou said
5151472 indeed its even more nonsensical when you understand that the city will accept credit card payments for the payment of vehicle taxes but wont accept it for real property taxes its make no logical sense
5151473 up until last year i have always done it by credit card to get air miles and then every three or four year i get to come to hawaii
5151474 many cities are moving in that direction because when you pay by credit card your guaranteed payment
5151475 theres a significant number of individuals who dont have a mortgage or that their mortgage terms did not have the mortgage company paying the real property taxes pay their property taxes directly
5151476 i dont think wed ever be interested in putting it on a credit card because we can just got to our bank and have them automatically pay the property tax
5151477 because of this investors are a bit edgy and are trimming their positions
5151478 ideally we wanted to keep all the parking stalls free
5151479 but youve got to compromise sometimes and i think it worked out for everyone
5151480 ilikai employees use it the people that live in the ilikai use it and the hilton people use it
5151481 this should be parking for water recreation but the parking lot just fills up with people that dont have anything to do with boats or water recreation
5151482 well see how the numbers work out and what happens
5151483 right now were just kind of guessing at whats going to happen we just dont know what its going to generate or how the parking will work we got to get in there and do it and then amend the plan as we go
5151484 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5151485 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5151486 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5151487 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5151488 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5151489 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5151490 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5151491 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5151492 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5151493 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5151494 just under average height more skinny than slim and with long usually unkempt hair hanging over my ears and forehead and down the scruff of my neck i also have heavily lidded eyes sunken cheeks and a pallor thats cadaverous
5151495 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5151496 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5151497 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5151498 we are waiting for them to come back with the law in english
5151499 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5151500 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5151501 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5151502 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5151503 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5151504 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5151505 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5151506 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5151507 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5151508 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5151509 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5151510 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5151511 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5151512 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5151513 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5151514 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5151515 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5151516 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5151517 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5151518 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5151519 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5151520 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5151521 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5151522 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5151523 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5151524 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5151525 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5151526 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5151527 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5151528 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5151529 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5151530 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5151531 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5151532 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5151533 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5151534 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5151535 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5151536 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5151537 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5151538 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5151539 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5151540 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5151541 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5151542 who are open to doing something on the production side
5151543 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5151544 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5151545 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5151546 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
5151547 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
5151548 you have only to look at one of the most beautiful women in the world elizabeth taylor when she is twenty pounds overweight as she occasionally is and compare her to the goddess she is when she is sleeked down to a size ten even her beauty cant survive runaway fat
5151549 the glandular dodge is out doctors find that behind nearly every fat person lies a history of compulsive secretive eating a dear friend of mine who was supposedly glandular was actually bolting a quart of chocolate ice cream every day after work before dinner even women fresh from childbirth have proved they can be slim again quick where can you hide take it off and you wont have to
5151550 you must at least create the illusion of beauty by acting beautiful you dont have to lie your head off and say i am i am i am when you know damn well you arent a stunner but you must love yourself enough to employ every device voice words clothes figure make up to become one
5151551 were up on top of the hill and im looking around and im saying what is going on
5151552 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
5151553 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
5151554 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
5151555 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
5151556 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
5151557 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
5151558 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
5151559 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
5151560 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
5151561 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
5151562 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
5151563 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
5151564 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5151565 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5151566 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
5151567 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
5151568 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
5151569 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
5151570 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
5151571 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
5151572 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
5151573 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
5151574 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
5151575 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
5151576 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5151577 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5151578 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5151579 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5151580 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
5151581 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5151582 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5151583 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5151584 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
5151585 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
5151586 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5151587 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5151588 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5151589 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5151590 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5151591 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5151592 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5151593 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5151594 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5151595 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5151596 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
5151597 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
5151598 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
5151599 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare
5151600 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
5151601 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
5151602 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
5151603 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
5151604 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
5151605 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
5151606 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
5151607 i truly believe that the florida division of elections every decision that came from their office favored bush
5151608 hannah montana and miley cyrus best of both worlds concert
5151609 a lottery and you know that with lotteries you lose most of the time
5151610 theres nothing like taking a nice quiet bomb apart to steady the nerves
5151611 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5151612 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5151613 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5151614 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5151615 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5151616 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
5151617 to provide for the health inspiration and education of the people of california by helping to preserve the states extraordinary biological diversity protecting its most valued natural and cultural resources and creating opportunities for high quality outdoor recreation
5151618 id be remiss if i didnt say hello buddy cianci mayor of providence
5151619 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper
5151620 i get amused when i see that stern faced young man from colorado extolling the merits of assault weapons
5151621 i didnt see any donkeys although we heard a weird sound when we first got in here
5151622 they must have you know seen me coming but they all hid somewhere
5151623 i dont care if you have jesus christ in the van
5151624 no i know if i needed to get out id make my way out just as i made my way in you have to see the possibilities
5151625 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
5151626 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
5151627 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
5151628 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
5151629 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
5151630 liberals are more self centered than conservatives conservatives are more generous and charitable than liberals liberals are more envious and less hardworking than conservatives conservatives value truth more than liberals and are less prone to cheating and lying liberals are more angry than conservatives conservatives are actually more knowledgeable than liberals liberals are more dissatisfied and unhappy than conservatives

5151633 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5151634 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5151635 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
5151636 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
5151637 a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cynicism rife among climate scientists
5151638 if nothing is done all the polar bears could die in our lifetime
5151639 science keeps getting stronger and the mathematical models keep getting better
5151640 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
5151641 scott you being unaware lord christopher monckton of brenchleys paper posted by roy august 16 2008 10 55 pm
5151642 expert scientists disagreed on the key contributor to global warming at a senate environment and public works committee hearing roy w spencer former nasa scientist during the clinton administration attributes the majority of global warming contributions to errors in measurement spencer claimed that the clinton administration told him what he could and could not say to congress about global warming and greenhouse emissions chairwoman barbara boxer d calif cited spencers blog where he admits that the clinton administration never told him what was and was not permissible to say to congress
5151643 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
5151644 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5151645 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5151646 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5151647 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5151648 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5151649 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5151650 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5151651 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
5151652 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
5151653 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder

5151655 in the summer of 2007 as arctic sea ice reached a record low the northwest passage opened between baffin bay and mcclure strait also known as mclure strait passing through parry channel this opening would be the route through the arctic most conducive to large scale shipping as of early august 2008 arctic sea ice was not expected to set a new melt record although its extent was well below the long term average whether the northwest passage would open as far north as it did the previous year remained in question but the sea ice in a more southerly route one taken by norwegian explorer roald amundsen in the early twentieth century had begun to melt
5151656 pete your just a denier the register didnt just make numbers up out of thin air they based on research from people who you know actually study the climate once again this doesnt fit your meme and mindset im hear to free ideologs like you and brian from your mind set
5151657 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
5151658 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
5151659 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5151660 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5151661 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5151662 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5151663 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5151664 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5151665 there is no system none in the world that cannot be hacked
5151666 two graduate students in 3 hours successfully hacked the machine and once they had completed writing their hack they then successfully added a 4 line code of self erasing virus to allow it to propagate across the network thats just two guys with two hours who had no interest or motivation in doing it other than scientific interest
5151667 there are people out there and theres a lot of them who dont really want to win elections what they want to do is they want to steal them they have an enormous incentive for power they have an enormous incentive for money and they have an enormous willingness to go and do it
5151668 i dont want to have a society where were not sure who won i want to live in a democracy where there is a valid capacity to audit the entire trail
5151669 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5151670 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5151671 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5151672 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5151673 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5151674 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5151675 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5151676 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
5151677 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
5151678 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
5151679 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
5151680 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
5151681 recycling is recycling glass should be included its not about making money its about making difference
5151682 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
5151683 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
5151684 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
5151685 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5151686 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
5151687 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
5151688 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
5151689 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5151690 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5151691 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5151692 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5151693 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5151694 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5151695 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
5151696 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
5151697 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
5151698 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
5151699 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
5151700 just so you all know we did set a record
5151701 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
5151702 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
5151703 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
5151704 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
5151705 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
5151706 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
5151707 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
5151708 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
5151709 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
5151710 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
5151711 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
5151712 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
5151713 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
5151714 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
5151715 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
5151716 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
5151717 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5151718 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5151719 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
5151720 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
5151721 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
5151722 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
5151723 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
5151724 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
5151725 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
5151726 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
5151727 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
5151728 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
5151729 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5151730 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5151731 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
5151732 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
5151733 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
5151734 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
5151735 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
5151736 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
5151737 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
5151738 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
5151739 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
5151740 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5151741 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5151742 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5151743 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5151744 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5151745 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5151746 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5151747 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5151748 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5151749 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5151750 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5151751 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5151752 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
5151753 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
5151754 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
5151755 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
5151756 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
5151757 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
5151758 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
5151759 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
5151760 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5151761 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5151762 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5151763 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5151764 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5151765 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5151766 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5151767 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5151768 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5151769 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5151770 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5151771 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5151772 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5151773 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5151774 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5151775 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5151776 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5151777 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5151778 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5151779 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5151780 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5151781 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5151782 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5151783 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5151784 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5151785 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5151786 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5151787 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5151788 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5151789 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5151790 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5151791 obviously you have to have a winner and a loser but theyre all winners because of things they take away from this
5151792 away from playing the game you enjoy the camaraderie the lessons the kids took from away from this and the opportunity to meet people from all across the country and the world for many of them it opens doors they never knew previously existed
5151793 theyve made friends with girls from other teams they were dancing at the opening dinner and they had so much fun at universal studios and all the other stuff too much fun i think
5151794 its a fun tournament its a good experience you get to do a lot of fun stuff and then of course you get to play
5151795 this is probably one of the best run tournaments around
5151796 its the most coach friendly tournament you dont have to worry about feeding them or getting them to the park and they get to play on quality fields
5151797 the rbi program gives these kids opportunities they could probably never have
5151798 when you get a chance to play at angel stadium or dodger stadium even to me im fired up it was very easy to get them to understand its a privilege to play today
5151799 were all so proud to be a part of rbi and part of the whole experience these girls get i think the experience is once in a lifetime for these girls theyre going to cherish this for the rest of their life
5151800 its something im really pleased with and im looking forward to the next one
5151801 i think it was pretty obvious weve got a lot of work to do based on tonight in all three phases of the game
5151802 it was a good opportunity for us to go against a quality defense
5151803 i know they had some guys out but this team is a really good team and for us to come out and put a drive together to start the game was good for our confidence
5151804 i played with luke before so it was an opportunity for us to run some old plays
5151805 he and i played together in cleveland so we have a way of connecting i kind of had an idea he was going to throw it because of the way the coverage looked we just happened to make the play
5151806 theyre doing jobs for us we dont have the manpower to do
5151807 people ask what im doing and they ask me if i get paid
5151808 to the instant reaction of his co horts he says
5151809 instead of doing nothing in the summer this was doing something meaningful
5151810 we want to assure the city of real value so these kids do real work
5151811 a lot of these kids had never worked with tools before
5151812 some have never worked outside or been in the woods
5151813 my mom told me i was going to work and that i was going to do this she wanted me out of the house
5151814 the ionsound residency will be great for our undergraduate and graduate composers because our students will be able to work with this ensemble on an ongoing basis
5151815 the group is open to new music of all styles and will help the students develop their craft through rehearsing and performing their compositions
5151816 because we are a liberal arts department not a conservatory we lack the performance resources of those institutions
5151817 instead we bring professional ensembles to perform on our music on the edge new music series and then invite them to stay to work with our graduate composers
5151818 working with professional musicians and a distinguished composition faculty is the best way to learn the art of composition now pitt will have both
5151819 i didnt meet him until i arrived in new york but its a good story go ahead and use it i wont tell
5151820 shall the county enact an ordinance to increase real estate taxes in order to repeal the alcoholic drink tax
5151821 this is the first step in challenging that whole process that they went through to put a referendum question on the ballot
5151822 the lawsuit is an attempt to reverse the power they gave themselves they are circumventing the county charter
5151823 the administrative code requires us to return the petition to fact
5151824 we have a problem with the wording of the anti drink tax referendum question it simply asks the voter to make a decision if they want lower taxes
5151825 my client was not under arrest he had not participated in any criminal acts and according to the allegheny county district attorneys office he was not about to be arrested for any reason
5151826 therefore the question remains how can a man die in the custody of the police when he is not the suspect of any criminal activity
5151827 attacked struck kicked punched bludgeoned beat repeatedly shocked him with a taser
5151828 we expect our officers to use some degree of judgment and discretion on the street
5151829 police thought he was dangerous how dangerous to whom in order to know if its ok to have used an electroshock weapon on a person you have to know what kind of danger this person posed you use the amount of force to meet the danger presented
5151830 if the guy is using fists youre one step ahead you use pepper spray but its messy it can get in your eyes you could use your night stick or metal baton but thats going to open some wounds up if the persons bigger than you and you shoot them you could kill them if you use the taser it will put them down in a heartbeat
5151831 police use it as a weapon of first choice thats the pattern weve noticed
5151832 i couldnt ask for more my husbands home with us everythings wonderful
5151833 the armed forces will not let them come home without the red cross stamp of approval
5151834 i left where i was stationed on the 10th but i didnt leave the country until the 11th and then i got home on the 12th
5151835 when he left for deployment i didnt know i was pregnant
5151836 he found out through text message that i was pregnant i tried calling him when i took the test but couldnt reach him i took a picture of the pregnancy test and texted it to him
5151837 he called me back and kept saying wow wow he was pretty excited weve been trying for years to get pregnant and were scared it wasnt possible for us
5151838 it wasnt the timing we expected but it definitely was the blessing we wanted
5151839 she had left a couple messages that she was in the hospital in labor then her sister called after and said the baby boy was fine
5151840 when i get back from afghanistan i plan on joining the mckeesport police force
5151841 the gates foundation has been investing heavily in control of infectious diseases in developing countries
5151842 is predicting how control strategies such as vaccines will work
5151843 test out the impact of new candidate vaccine technologies and select the most effective strategies
5151844 neonatal immunization improved stable vaccines convenient needle free delivery systems and new vaccine products could spare millions of children from serious infections and deaths each year
5151845 but he still had time for his family on weekends
5151846 up until three years ago he would be at work every morning before i got there
5151847 he was like the caretaker of the community if someone needed a fishing rod or a job hed take them under his wing
5151848 if one needed an odd job he always had them doing stuff
5151849 its been interesting to see at the funeral home all the lives he touched not just the big guy from the bank but a vast array of people
5151850 for the past two years leroy shared his life with cancer on the air and online with passion wit and a kind brutal honesty that created a safe space for an open and candid dialogue about the disease
5151851 cancer was not in leroys plans but he turned his battle with cancer into the most dramatic the most moving and the most important story of his life
5151852 he couldve ended up dead im really angry at the people who dont follow the rules
5151853 the real concerns are people driving 4 000 pound machines that have the ability to kill pedestrians cyclists and people in wheelchairs
5151854 in 22 years of commuting to oakland i have never seen a cyclist stop at a red light or stop sign
5151855 theres a physics argument on why some bikers dont stop at stop signs
5151856 i dont see why bikes are special and not subject to the speed limit
5151857 it is my intention to make sure everyone understands those laws
5151858 we backed off and let the experts handle it they went through everything
5151859 multiple assault type weapons were found various handguns altered firearms and unlawful possession firearms ammunition for those weapons homemade incendiary devices and military type incendiary devices
5151860 i knew he had a lot of guns hes a hunter but the explosives i dont know nothing about that
5151861 our real goal here is that students get current up to date information and that they learn about it in an exciting way
5151862 it answers the question whether its math or science or english why do i have to learn this
5151863 every person every day i was there voiced the same complaint that people arent taught proper e mail etiquette
5151864 we have to spend a little more time on those things that we take for granted
5151865 theres a lot of good paying jobs here but they have to know how to find them
5151866 there are excellent jobs high paying jobs available and were never going to get them filled if we dont have students coming in
5151867 weve got to get them into real world positions weve got to build it from the ground up
5151868 we still feel theres a small group were not reaching
5151869 school breakfast really is the most important meal of the day
5151870 the simplest word i can use to describe mcgee was kindness
5151871 he was the kindest man ive ever met and it didnt matter who you were he treated everybody like that
5151872 let me put it this way he was the best man at my wedding and he was the godfather for both of my children
5151873 i met him when i went out for the basketball team at st marys in fifth grade and hes been close to me ever since a day wouldnt go by that we didnt talk
5151874 but we still talked every day i never made a move without checking with him
5151875 as a coach he just wanted it to be fun for us
5151876 he gave me my first big chance and im forever grateful to him he was just a wonderful man
5151877 i can honestly say he was the best coach ive ever been exposed to on any level
5151878 you dont realize that when youre a high school kid but he had his teams so well prepared and ready to play he preached toughness and discipline
5151879 plus as a guy hed do anything for you hed let us use his car im talking about a bunch of high school kids he was all about loyalty of course he expected that loyalty in return he was one of a kind and we were blessed to have him
5151880 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
5151881 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
5151882 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
5151883 how to tell if you have fake or real taiyo yuden
5151884 fire dancing circuses and 3 000 person light saber war
5151885 this is a problem that school districts across the country face
5151886 thats why the administration is focused on increasing school achievement levels hiring strong teachers and principals all in an effort to prevent this type of predicament in years to come
5151887 over time researchers realized thats not enough to maintain the environment for fishes invertebrates and to some extent marine mammals
5151888 if virginia was the same state as it was four years ago or eight years ago there wouldnt be much discussion about virginia being a swing state
5151889 a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5151890 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5151891 we know very well that the inguri hydropower plant supplies electricity to dozens of thousands of georgian and abkhaz homes and we are well aware that strategic facilities of this kind could be targeted in provocations and even terror attacks
5151892 its a little bit crazy at this time of the year
5151893 people are outside they are playing with pets they are going to picnics children are at sleepover camps little kids get sick in the swimming pool there are a lot of ways for outbreaks to get started
5151894 were always just a phone call away from a disaster
5151895 don was very honest about those times but also sentimental
5151896 when he would tell stories about hank hed sometimes well up with emotion
5151897 we cannot stand idly by and wait for market forces or the electricity good fairy to solve this problem for us
5151898 we already saw what happened when we tried to whistle a happy song 70 percent rate hikes
5151899 we need to harness clean energy in a way that we can tell people theres an economic benefit
5151900 i dont really care i just care that i won i said i would and i did thats all that matters
5151901 i will tell her to never put an age limit on her dreams
5151902 not getting it up and down on 11 kind of ticked me off
5151903 i kind of told myself im letting the tournament get away from me again that was where the tournament was won for me
5151904 we didnt score many points last year with last years team and i think its a good thing that the defense is excelling
5151905 if we were scoring at will id be really nervous i feel good because i know our defense is going to be able to stop people we just need to clean up and be more precise offensively and we will be
5151906 i wish it would have been a little more intense
5151907 i had to cut it back numbers wise because i had a lot of guys out nicked ron brace didnt go toal didnt go they were just little nagging things brace had a back issue toal has a neck or trapezius deal we were very very vanilla today and i just wanted them to play football
5151908 i look at teams around the country and floridas got five acl injuries and they cant even scrimmage right now and im not going to do that im going to make sure that im going into kent state healthy that is for sure
5151909 i think were tired of playing our defense day after day we want to get some new competition in there and thats a compliment to our defense but each day were getting better and we just have to continue on that trend
5151910 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5151911 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5151912 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5151913 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5151914 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5151915 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5151916 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5151917 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5151918 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5151919 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5151920 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5151921 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr
5151922 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5151923 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5151924 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5151925 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5151926 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5151927 i have heard from several different media but not once from the police its very annoying
5151928 i gave up hope in 1994 when those remains were found
5151929 i think they were johns but id like to know if there is a second set of remains buried there
5151930 i just dont understand why that hasnt been done yet that is the first thing that should have been done
5151931 you had your chance to talk to me these past two weeks and you didnt now you dont have that chance anymore
5151932 why dont we put all of the interns down in front and let the djs stand in the back
5151933 i dont know i think that was a bad decision on nascars part
5151934 i think it was just a lot of whiny complainers that got their way and hopefully we can get out there and whoop their butt again
5151935 we were three horsepower ahead of ford and i think three or four ahead of the dodge and then the chevrolet motors were way down
5151936 i dont think anybody is working in the chevrolet sb2 because they are trying to get the r07 approved but if they get the r07 approved then the bore stroke on that is the same as the toyota engines so they get the restrictor plate that we got
5151937 so i dont know nascars decision is nascars decision so well work with it rumor has it whatever theyve lost in horsepower weve already gained half back so good luck everybody
5151938 you dont want to have to depend on someone else to do your dirty work you want to go out there and take the guy out thats in front of you in points we had a shot to move up to the no 2 position in the standings and we just let it get away from us
5151939 it was a very good race antron and i both basically just guessed at the starting lights but you have to take chances sometimes as a driver and that was one of those times we both had to do our jobs it was very close all the way from start to finish they just came out on the better end
5151940 i told crew chief mike green and the guys not to hang their heads
5151941 im down a little bit but at the same time i have to look at the whole picture were in the countdown were very solid in the point standings and were going to look good going into indy im looking forward to that
5151942 hey i love being friends with you but if i find someone else that im really interested in im going to ditch you so that i can be happy
5151943 the situation was getting pretty serious and i knew that the weather was getting worse and i was starting to have to really plan ahead for something dramatic mr cole told network ten today
5151944 i just knew that i had to try and survive to help them out
5151945 i tried to make the right decisions and luckily we got out
5151946 there were a couple of moments where i had to lead them up quite a dangerous avalanche slope and i told them to hang on and when i went up i set an avalanche off and i really feared for their lives but we just had to continue on and try
5151947 literally we were digging ourselves in a hole deeper and deeper and getting buried more and more he said
5151948 i just wanted to try and jot down some of my thoughts and what was happening because i didnt know if wed get out of it and i just wanted to write a record down when i was still sane because in such cold conditions your body starts deteriorating quite quickly
5151949 we didnt verify their details so they need to call back to verify those details the spokeswoman said

5151953 it appears that the federal government is starting to recognise that more staff are needed to get its massive job done cpsu national secretary stephen jones said
5151954 if government is serious about solving some of the countrys biggest challenges it needs to make sure it does not burn out its best talent
5151955 it needs to ensure that it has an adequately funded and properly resourced public service to get the job done
5151956 we encourage the federal government to abandon these arbitrary cuts to public services and ensure there are enough staff to deliver the services that australians expect

5151975 wat zou er gebeuren als iemand toen in coma was geraakt en nu vijftig jaar later wakker was geworden zou hij nederland nog herkennen wat is er gebeurd met ons christelijke land

5151995 as our costs go up our ability to hold down rates certainly diminishes
5151996 the thing that concerns me most is that there are ways to manage revenues and expenses that arent always based on fee increases i would suggest we look at other options
5151997 the demand is high for all the various uses and municipal governments make up a small percentage of the world chemical market
5151998 we are a small player in a big market and we have to suffer through that volatility we are a little bit at the mercy of vendors we have to have the chemicals because we have to have the service
5151999 there was a definite cockiness that democrats felt once they regained control of congress and ive felt it was a misplaced cockiness
5152000 i dont think you see leads in presidential races over five points in this day and age
5152001 some of our more skilled players didn t compete very hard we made adjustments in that area without giving up any offence it may be a different type of offence
5152002 the best thing to do for our country is to start getting our troops home now

5152004 i dont think there will be anyone in ipswich angry that i didnt come out
5152005 i think what people will be saying is were pleased that hes coming out to tell me because ive known about it because i think everybody has suspected it but no one has actually faced it
5152006 now i want people to come up to me and say paul i ve got ms or can you help me
5152007 i really wanted to be the mayor of ipswich and 2000 was the time to run for the deputy mayors job and 2004 was when i ran for the mayors job so it was a crucial thing
5152008 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5152009 its a good way to attract families so that they can learn about you know small steps they can take to reduce their carbon footprint
5152010 weve tried to replace light bulbs we can probably encourage more recyclable materials with our vendors
5152011 because were a fair we like things bright and shiny lights running and colorful
5152012 thats our goal though is to change with the times
5152013 all the days events at least the ones were allowed into
5152014 the daily show news scraper 117 stories 73 situation rooms 26 news tickers
5152015 you all the news stories first before its even true
5152016 we get to talk to people from all over the world they actually go crazy when they see us
5152017 they cant believe this is happening in america that in a big city like fort worth theres a cowboy walking down the street or on the back of a horse
5152018 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5152019 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5152020 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5152021 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5152022 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5152023 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5152024 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5152025 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5152026 but i dont see a difference between a movie and a song they both may have some basis in reality
5152027 jeg klarer ikke rekker ikke henge med og det er fordi jeg er dum
5152028 this is a great environment there are great people out here we all came to get out of the house
5152029 the first year we did the barbecue to start off we added the talent showcase last year and it went well
5152030 i think i did all right i cant really think right now
5152031 i like to socialize with the other people here and jam with some good music maybe
5152032 this was above and beyond a normal disaster but you welcome being of service people here would definitely step up and do what they could
5152033 it sounds like it would be easy to give people help
5152034 after talking to some of those homeowners you can sense the devastation it affects so many aspects of peoples lives
5152035 they need to quit hanging out and do something with their lives
5152036 my son was going down the wrong path now its time were going to stop that
5152037 you dont know what to say or do so were hoping to put together something to stop that
5152038 we want to show the people in the community especially the young people that we understand they have struggles in their lives and that we care
5152039 anyone who wears it basically is saying i care about you
5152040 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5152041 w hat they the obama camp are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5152042 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5152043 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5152044 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5152045 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5152046 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5152047 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5152048 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5152049 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5152050 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5152051 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5152052 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5152053 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5152054 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5152055 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5152056 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5152057 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5152058 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5152059 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5152060 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5152061 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5152062 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5152063 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5152064 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5152065 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5152066 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5152067 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5152068 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5152069 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5152070 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5152071 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5152072 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5152073 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5152074 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5152075 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5152076 this is a planning took where all things are going
5152077 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5152078 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5152079 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5152080 with the ever increasing need for companies to participate in the green movement this is the right product at the right time
5152081 with the rising costs of petroleum and starch based alternatives milex affords companies a more stable cost structure for their operations
5152082 and a lot of times green products cost more milex doesnt
5152083 i sincerely believe that this bill puts families at a risk on the highways and would result in death or serious injury
5152084 further if two 9 1 2 foot boats were to meet on an 18 foot strip of road or bridge it would be physically impossible to escape a collision
5152085 theyve been running those boats up and down the highways of north carolina since 1982
5152086 the way i look at it if you get something from a doctor you dont like you find a doctor that gives you better options i found another doctor who said i would live seven to 20 years so i like that doctor better
5152087 he tries to be involved as much as he can without being intrusive
5152088 i aspire to be as strong as him and tough in all areas of life
5152089 i knew it drove him crazy to be as uninvolved as he was just going to the games i was happy for him that hes found a way to get a little more satisfaction feeling a part of the team
5152090 he could play linebacker for us but hes sacrificed for the team to play offensive line
5152091 hes a little undersized to be a lineman 6 1 220 but hes tough as nails
5152092 i dont know what level of football he can play but he would be a valuable member of any team because hes that kind of kid
5152093 other than his fingers blake barely moves while playing his feet are set in place and his eyes are locked on the screen as he peers through a mop of curly brown hair gaming for him is serious business its his job
5152094 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
5152095 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
5152096 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
5152097 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
5152098 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
5152099 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
5152100 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
5152101 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
5152102 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
5152103 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
5152104 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
5152105 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
5152106 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
5152107 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
5152108 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
5152109 in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
5152110 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
5152111 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
5152112 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
5152113 tendency of the white house to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies
5152114 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
5152115 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
5152116 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
5152117 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
5152118 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
5152119 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
5152120 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush his bullying impulse fused permanently with satisfying vengeance in the scattering ashes of 9 11
5152121 the high purpose his angry words carried after the attacks and in two elections since is dissolving with each passing minute
5152122 was sent to new york on a project for the book
5152123 detained by federal agents in manhattan he was interrogated and his notes were confiscated violations of his first and fourth amendment rights
5152124 a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5152125 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5152126 we know very well that the inguri hydropower plant supplies electricity to dozens of thousands of georgian and abkhaz homes and we are well aware that strategic facilities of this kind could be targeted in provocations and even terror attacks
5152127 why not some wet felting and some dry needle felting
5152128 i was on the limit this morning to try to catch duval
5152129 i set some great stage times on friday and with a bit more consistency i will be able to fight for a top place on this surface but i couldnt match the speed of the top two here but i feel my asphalt driving has improved and it was unfortunate i lost time with a puncture last night
5152130 it started well on friday and i had a good position and feeling with the car but yesterday and today were nightmares
5152131 i had a new experience in comparing pirellis hard and soft compound tyres they did a good job for us and were strong this rally also showed me how important mental preparation is i need to work on that this week before rally new zealand and start from zero again to move forwards i also want to complete some asphalt training before the next rally on that surface in spain in october
5152132 we made a good start on friday with a terrific performance from mikko but a lack of experience on the most difficult asphalt rally in the championship with a constantly changing road surface resulted in us not taking as many points as we would have liked however the drivers have learned a lot for the final two rallies on this surface
5152133 weve relinquished the lead in the manufacturers championship here but the fight to win it back begins in new zealand in a fortnight the gravel roads there are more favoured by our drivers and well look to reclaim the series lead immediately
5152134 were not as concerned about it as we initially were
5152135 sister a real terrible thing has happened to our town
5152136 weve got a lot of people here who need help we cant just throw them out on the street
5152137 theyre our family theyve made their homes here had jobs here raised families here
5152138 perpignan canet plage je ne suis jamais all mais javais un cousin qui vivait l il y a tr s longtemps
5152139 et il appuiera sur le bouton droit de la souris ouvrira une autre fen tre sur un autre monde internaute
5152140 mon village mon clocher mon millier dhabitants a fait du bien de voir les visages en buvant un verre de vin
5152141 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5152142 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5152143 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5152144 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5152145 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5152146 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5152147 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5152148 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5152149 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5152150 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5152151 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5152152 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5152153 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5152154 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5152155 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5152156 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5152157 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5152158 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5152159 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5152160 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5152161 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5152162 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5152163 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5152164 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5152165 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5152166 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5152167 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5152168 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5152169 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5152170 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5152171 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5152172 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5152173 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5152174 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5152175 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5152176 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5152177 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5152178 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5152179 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5152180 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5152181 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5152182 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5152183 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5152184 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5152185 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5152186 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5152187 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5152188 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5152189 our present troubles are quite small and wont last very long great glory that will last forever
5152190 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5152191 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5152192 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5152193 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5152194 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5152195 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5152196 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5152197 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5152198 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5152199 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5152200 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5152201 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5152202 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5152203 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5152204 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5152205 there was an attitude among editors look were going to war why do we even worry about all the contrary stuff
5152206 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5152207 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5152208 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5152209 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5152210 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5152211 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5152212 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5152213 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5152214 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5152215 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5152216 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again
5152217 going to the olympics would be like the best thing to ever happen to me
5152218 i couldnt even imagine what it would be like a dream come true
5152219 they come in here and we totally forget where they were in the streets
5152220 we almost try to avoid projecting that youre a gang member and we dont spend a lot of time talking about their gang ties or their gang involvement its about what youre going to be now and what youre going to be in the future
5152221 yes it is true its really down to the us dollar and its weakening value which has been relative to other countries over the past 12 18 months we got to a point where pricing action needed to be taken
5152222 we havent had any negative reaction from our customers or our partners in fact they were waiting for it to happen we dont know how long it will be in force this has been coming for some time people are realistic and understand these sorts of things need to take place
5152223 you could tie the jelly doll pocket to your mobile devices as an accessory which allows you save and load your data anytime anywhere like a movable mini database
5152224 todays service celebrates our caring for all animals not just our household pets
5152225 we gather today in recognition of our attachment to all the animals who share or have shared our lives and this planet with us
5152226 i think that we need to recognize that were all gods creatures
5152227 people and animals are part of a continuum and to set a bar between people and animals to say that were one thing and theyre another doesnt make sense
5152228 i am baffled by people who say that animals cant think
5152229 i mean they have a brain and they act what theyre thinking
5152230 a manifestation of respect for the interdependent web of all existence
5152231 the dogs need opportunities to be in more formal social situations last year maggie was tugging on her leash so shes getting better
5152232 buster has been such a blessing to us so we thought we would come in and have him blessed
5152233 mr greenwood youre violating a subdivision rule that prohibits pickup trucks in your driveway
5152234 its very frustrating and confusing its hard to imagine how an hoa would try to dictate what type of vehicle you can drive and park in your driveway
5152235 home prices in the us are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
5152236 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
5152237 are likely to remain substantially elevated this year and next and home prices are likely to decline further on a national basis
5152238 cities such as los angeles las vegas and miami which saw the largest price gains
5152239 the rising share of foreclosed homes in overall sales bodes negatively for home prices
5152240 the light at the end of the tunnel is a faint and distant one further the risks to this outlook weigh heavily on the downside with the main risk being the potential for financial markets to unravel further
5152241 it will be well into 2009 before the market works off all the excesses accumulated during the housing boom
5152242 we were in motorcade until 5 30 p m et then a holding room in another building with no tv
5152243 never take a 2 year old to play putt putt
5152244 they spent three million dollars last year to study the dna of bears in montana i dont know if it was a paternity issue or criminal but it was a waste of money
5152245 look at me i got pregnant when i was 15 but i stayed off of welfare and worked my way to a degree i told you i wouldnt be a failure
5152246 that equals out to about a medal and a half for each hour he spent in combat there were infantry guys grunts on the ground who had more than 7 000 hours in combat and i can tell you that there were times and situations where im sure a prison cell would have looked pretty good to them by comparison the question really is how many guys got that number of medals for not being shot down
5152247 hey everybody this weekend lets do this thing just because we can
5152248 id like to tell a story bout a girl from chairo
5152249 and where she learned to eat a pussy well never know she was the top girl in her class and then her number came up and she was gone in the draft shes in the army now and all the girls agree shes the cunnilingus champion of company b

5152272 when you are shooting in the olympics it comes down to who can best perform under extreme pressure out there everybody is as good as the next person its not a physical thing anymore the difference between the best and the rest is the mental game
5152273 there are guys who shoot perfect scores in practice and then they fall apart in the competition
5152274 its like having a phobia it gets into their head and tears them apart a lot of what i do is teach them to let it go

5152278 at the very center was a huge transportation center that on different levels included depots for buses and trains as well as highway intersections and at the top an airport he had the fanciful notion that commercial airliners would land between the huge skyscrapers
5152279 running mates are picked for a variety of reasons an overall appeal to voters lukewarm to the candidate the prospect of victory in a much desired state simple affinity
5152280 despite his claim to hate the debt reagan instituted unprecedented peacetime deficit spending
5152281 by the end of his term 138 reagan administration officials had been convicted had been indicted or had been the subject of official investigations for official misconduct and or criminal violations in terms of number of officials involved the record of his administration was the worst ever

5152309 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5152310 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5152311 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5152312 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5152313 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground

5152339 they the siegelman defense have an affidavit from a lawyer who says she heard a top republican operative in alabama boast in 2002 that the united states attorneys in alabama would

5152341 into the wild is very cool with a unique look at the great fairytale characters i couldnt put it down until i knew how this brave extraordinary girl could face such powerful magic
5152342 sarah beth dursts into the wild is fabulous in the oldest truest and best sense of the word harking back to fables wonder and magic unleashed its bold sassy and utterly engaging i cant wait to see what she does next
5152343 into the wilds fairy tale characters are fascinating and julie is everything one could want in a heroine shes intelligent practical determined and brave at once more ordinary and more extraordinary than she herself thinks she is ill be keeping an eye out for more work from sarah beth durst
5152344 an amazing wild ride with very high stakes and the fate of humans and fairytale people alike on the shoulders of one determined girl this is even better than the first book
5152345 this is one of those rare occasions when the sequel is as good as the first book if not better though in my estimation they make two halves of one story and what a wonderfully entertaining story it is
5152346 head spinning fun any book that mixes fire breathing dragons and elvis presley is a rare treat
5152347 after thoroughly researching the mythology of the leprechaun and interviewing scores of eyewitnesses we were able to sketch out a ten mile range that we suspected comprised the leprechauns habitat
5152348 we noticed an abnormally large of sightings focused around the south bend and mishawaka area in indiana clustered mainly around an old ivy covered region nestled between two lakes that the locals call notra dayme the village folk warned us that it was a mysterious place full of strange religious intrigue full of great peril but we persevered on into the uncharted areas and saw our stakeout through
5152349 while most contemporary experts on leprechauns felt that their habitat was limited to the hilly irish countryside or as some offshoot schools of thought have suggested its easy to see a migratory pattern that would place it in that region of indiana

5152358 it was a memorable experience for me but i could not witness the retreating phase
5152359 we came back around 4pm when we heard that the morcha supporters would not let us enter kurseong we came back from zero point
5152360 we had police escort and if we wanted to we could have reached the hills but his son mohan was not in a state of mind to go through all the trouble and decided to perform the last rites in siliguri
5152361 it is very unfortunate that apparently because of the objection from morcha supporters the body could not be taken to her hometown
5152362 we want to pay our respects and we will do it here
5152363 initially we thought that the body would go first to manju where the family used to live and the last rites would be performed there but when we came to know that the body would not be allowed to enter the hills we came down

5152369 how the site used to work is completely different than how it works now
5152370 now theres sort of and this is a credit to digg from my perspective its harder and harder to predict what stories will go to the front page it used to be based on the numbers alone like if a story has 150 diggs itd go to the front page in the past it did feel like you were able to not control necessarily you could leverage power over your submission to get to the front page and thats harder and harder now
5152371 i speak to most of them and know them personally i talk to them on the phone its a network we all speak to each other all the people who get five or six stories a month on the front page we see each other on im and say hello to one another
5152372 if you have good content and not the networking if you dont know how to optimize content then theres no way to get to the front page unless you happen to be really lucky
5152373 while you need to first find an interesting article digg gives you that power to sell it if you dont have the power to sell it then its not going to make it to the front page im not saying that only power users are successful because there must be 5 000 to 10 000 people who can get a front page article its just that you have to sell the article and if you dont its not going to make it
5152374 i digg friends articles i do think it works both ways if you find yourself removed it is because you didnt digg me or werent around for awhile digg me and i will add you back freedom of speech is best and agree to disagree is my policy
5152375 my brother mark cuban is attempting to purchase the chicago cubs so i have been gravitating to stories about that
5152376 i generally come across those links in the chicago tribune since those will be the freshest and most relevant on the subject i feel stories on the cubs pending sale are of national interest to the digg sports community the digg community has confirmed this all but 1 of my submissions on this subject have gone front page
5152377 i think a lot of it is wives tales and it is certainly all speculation
5152378 the digg community is so large that i think it would take a very concerted effort of lots of diggers to bury a story that would otherwise have national interest i think a lot of stories that you would not think would appeal to the masses make it though artificially because people just do not care about the subject matter enough to take a positive or negative interest in it and it slides through this happens a lot with videos if the subject matter touches a nerve on some level people will respond one way or the other as along as there are algorithms there will be mit math geeks who crack them and figure out how to beat them i think it is a good thing that people probe for weakness that leads to improvement and innovation
5152379 heres the secret want to your stories to be popular and go to the front page blind digg blind digg everything the power users submit youll get there soon its a gross and disturbing display digg is a mere shadow of its former glory
5152380 its 4chan its lolcats its goat fucking stories its 12 year old bathroom humor that will make you king of the frontpage
5152381 some great obscure content there if you know where to look but its buried deep in the site i keep waiting for digg to right itself and the community to realign maybe one day one day i wont care much and will give up and will fade away with the rest of them for now its a bad habit i cant seem to break yet

5152490 through our extensive marketing efforts we procured an all cash 1031 exchange buyer from california through a california agent
5152491 it was a challenging sale given the fact coffee bean amp tea leaf announced during escrow that they would not be opening their store at this location
5152492 we overcame that obstacle in addition to some other difficult deal points to successfully close escrow and achieve both the buyers and sellers investment goals even with the coffee bean amp tea leaf situation the buyer liked the strength of the location which was adjacent to uc riverside the closing cap rate of 5 68 percent represents a near record cap rate for similar type product in riverside county
5152493 the sale required a 60 percent down payment and the assumption of an existing loan

5152512 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5152513 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution

5152527 as with all our color collections we base our shades on what is happening on the runways
5152528 this fall we saw colors coming from the world of deep rich reds and dark browns which is why we conceptualized a collection based on chocolate and cherries the look of the collection focuses on a dark lip and eye its an exaggerated couture look both aspirational and alluring

5152530 once the home of british pirates a unique culture developed here when the british moved a population of slaves from the caribbean island of san vincent to nearby roatan in 1795 from this seed grew a large garifuna culture that spread through northern honduras and into guatemala one finds english garifuna and spanish spoken here with descendants of all three cultures populating the island
5152531 we started from bhaktinagar at 6 a m yesterday and covered the 52km distance till kurseong where we halted for the night today we started at around 5a m from kurseong stopped for lunch in sonada and reached darjeeling at 7 p m food and lodging arrangements has been made at chowrasta
5152532 earlier too the bhaktinagar block of jalpaiguri administered by siliguri municipal corporation smc included within the gorkhaland map is always forgotten when demanding gorkhaland it is always darjeeling dooars siliguri and darjeeling we want bhaktinagar to be verbally pronounced in the list of territories embodying separate state
5152533 we came here before the tripartite meeting so that when the gjmm demands gorkhaland with the centre it should include all areas falling within gorkhaland map
5152534 with many immigrants there is this sense that they made this hard choice to leave their homelands and they are going to make it under any cost

5152539 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5152540 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5152541 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5152542 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5152543 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5152544 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5152545 nazario said that he was asked are they dead yet
5152546 ive put in applications everywhere for everything but nobody wants to hire you if you have been indicted

5152551 the usefulness of religion the fact that it gives life meaning that it makes people feel good is not an argument for the truth of any religious doctrine its not an argument that its reasonable to believe that jesus really was born of a virgin or that the bible is the perfect word of the creator of the universe you can only believe those things or you should be only able to believe those things if you think there are good reasons to believe those things

5152575 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5152576 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5152577 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5152578 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5152579 john mccain has never questioned sen obamas patriotism but he clearly does question sen obamas experience and judgment and they do have profound differences of opinion on the best way to reduce our dependence on mideast oil bring jobs back to america and keep our nation safe
5152580 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5152581 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5152582 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5152583 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5152584 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5152585 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5152586 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5152587 respect indeed reverence for the constitution is a proper attitude for conservatives to cultivate is it respectful to the constitution to maintain that of the two methods of amendment specified by article v one is too dangerous to be put to use
5152588 i think the article v convention represents a profound political protection for us as a people against the tyranny of central government and whatever we say about article v i think it is very very wrong just because we may disagree with the content of any particular constitutional amendment that is now being proposed to interpret article v in such a way as to clip its wings as a protection for the liberties of the people that is why i think it is profoundly important particularly for constitutional scholars to be hospitable toward the concern that article v represents which is that there be a way out for the states and the people if a willful and intransigent central authority governs us in a way we find unacceptable
5152589 a little rebellion now and then is a good thing and as necessary in the political world as storms are in the physical
5152590 to make matters worse lightning has impacted some of our computer systems meaning crews have to manually check each substation to assess damage
5152591 weve created a consultation process to ensure that all who wish to participate will have an opportunity to do so in as meaningful and convenient a manner as possible
5152592 we are hoping the feedback will be as comprehensive and representative of the community as possible
5152593 there is clear direction of the need to implement further development guidelines regarding water conservation energy efficiency hill side development and environmentally sensitive land areas
5152594 we are now seeking public feedback to guide development of additional policies
5152595 to develop an effective approach to informing young women about this risk factor for breast cancer we need a better understanding of young women
5152596 as part of a study funded by the canadian breast cancer research alliance we are consulting young women age 15 to 24 from across the country on this topic to do this we have been conducting focus groups and are implementing an online survey to reach other women
5152597 the locations were chosen because of the provinces different smoking rates b c has the lowest provincial prevalence rate for smoking 15 per cent with new brunswick among the provinces with the highest rates 22 per cent the web based survey is intended to build on the knowledge gathered through focus groups by reaching out to a wider audience of young women the results of the survey will be used to prepare for a larger national study
5152598 the beetle has a one year life cycle so you wont be able to tell that theres been damage most of the trees that are being attacked right for up to 9 12 months
5152599 sometimes after the tree has been compromised woodpeckers will come in and strip the bark off its then you start to see trees turning yellow and red
5152600 the beetles are carried by the wind but they also fly most of the bug infestations are on the westside in the lodge pole pine populations at high elevations i expect thats where theyre coming from
5152601 a lot is dependent on weather i think a lot of the beetles would prefer to stay up in the high elevation forests where there is a lot of food the unpredictable factor is how quickly they will build up in the city
5152602 its pretty much run its course in the north and central interior sometime over the next five years we expect the beetles will have run out of food theyll either be dispersed into new areas or just die out

5152614 i like the fact that for the most part my poems are pretty accessible
5152615 there are some big domestic issues out there on the other hand much of that is built into the market and i do think from these levels we could have a nice bounce
5152616 we want a good portion of our money invested in the international markets
5152617 were in a lower than average return cycle for domestic stocks i dont think were going to get back to the glory days you have to look elsewhere for return
5152618 not since iago and othello obsessed on the comely cassio not since richard of gloucester killed his two nephews not since nixon and johnson glowered at the glittering j f k has there been such an unseemly outpouring of boy envy
5152619 it seems a president obama would be harder to make fun of than these guys
5152620 bill clinton continues to howl at the moon and any reporters in the vicinity about obama hes starting to make king lear look like ryan seacrest
5152621 barack obama has long been his partys presumptive nominee now hes becoming its presumptuous nominee

5152636 why is it taking so long to get ads out
5152637 we can see little flashpoints in gas prices or a spike in joblessness but getting the whole picture is extremely difficult in part because were depending on government collected data which could often be three months later
5152638 is it a housing story is it a gasoline prices story is it an inflation story
5152639 we need to create other listening posts than the treasury department and the bureau of labor statistics
5152640 overall this is a hard story for journalists to tell because it isnt an event it isnt a person
5152641 and yet where they can get a handle on it its a story that people are eager to hear

5152665 we had no idea that there was an age limit for gymnastics in the olympics if there really is then china did break the rules

5152667 gold medal winners are always criticized team usa is just jealous
5152668 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5152669 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5152670 that fraud has increased and appraisal fraud has increased in a way to exacerbate the problems
5152671 the higher the loan amount the more money brokers and lenders make in the deal
5152672 and they threaten you they say if you dont play ball with us well go somewhere else and they do ive seen my business shrink theyre all doing it its hard to stay honest
5152673 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5152674 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5152675 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5152676 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5152677 either you shut it off completely in a state or you just send letters
5152678 the threat of the atomic bomb is the only thing
5152679 they know they can keep doing what theyre doing because they can get away with it
5152680 theyre not getting punished and states arent doing more because they know regulators wont do a thing
5152681 i wasnt alone we had appraisers from all over the nation writing in and urging them to take action
5152682 resulting from inappropriate pressure being placed on real estate property appraisers to hit a certain value
5152683 people who say we should have done more dont understand how the system works
5152684 agencies just dont lobby to change things we had no interest in doing anything like that it just wasnt our area
5152685 good position to work with bank regulators and others on the problem
5152686 everything related to the issue went into a black hole why i just dont know
5152687 i tried to push but nobody wanted to hear what i was saying
5152688 problem appraisals are being allowed and in some ways even encouraged by a regulatory structure that promotes lax enforcement and ineffective oversight
5152689 we are here to alert congress that the licensing system it created for appraisers is broken and needs to be fixed
5152690 but states dont have the money to hire personnel to carry out what the system was designed to do
5152691 may have been rude or said my house wasnt worth as much as i thought
5152692 just because youre disciplined that doesnt make you a bad appraiser
5152693 i may have done some technical things wrong but ive done a good job im proud of my work
5152694 why should he get super zapped for doing a lot of little things that a lot of other appraisers are doing every day but havent had complaints turned in on them
5152695 there has to be effective enforcement of some sort there has to be reality to it
5152696 what are you going to do if there is pressure on appraisers how are you going to penalize someone who puts that pressure on appraisers whos going to do it whos going to enforce it they need to have that or it wont work
5152697 we have to get our regular season legs under us pretty quickly and become a better tackling team

5152705 i didnt know if they were going to call it
5152706 quite the contrary we know exactly what you do and who you do it with and im afraid you wont be permitted to do it anymore we have rules
5152707 rules what about my rights if youre going to charge me i want my lawyer i want my minute of discretionary conversation
5152708 forgotten the law we made the law my grandfathers grandfather brought the law here with him from earth and forged a new world around it we made the law when we made this city from the living rock made farm lands from the lifeless dust we made the law for people like us louis we made the law for the people who would abide by it not for you
5152709 you didnt make the law like you said you just brought it with you it was written by better men than you i have the right to a fair trial by a jury of my peers everything i know about you and what you do will be brought to public record there you cant stop it you cant stop the people hearing about how you run your little empire well see how they like you when i tell them what you are you go ahead and try me if you dare and ill hang you on the letter of your own law
5152710 look at what we have made here you think you can take this from me
5152711 our previous studies showed that soft landing can be used to prepare ultrapure peptide layers on substrates the question we faced was in addition to controlling purity can we also control the structure of the molecules we showed we could
5152712 because we were starting from something that wasnt helical in solution we were a little pessimistic whether it would work at all
5152713 we found an interesting pathway to conduct different types of chemical reactions between complex molecules and substrates that will potentially enable us to prepare materials that cannot be made by standard methods
5152714 we hope to conduct lots of chemistry on the thin films
5152715 we need not worry about others none can prevent us from returning to power

5152728 in school many people see track as a means of gaining an academic scholarship there is also more to it
5152729 due to frequent tides we can beach the ship just two hundred yards metres from the coast
5152730 it saves us thousands of dollars for every ship we break whereas in alang and china they beach ships two or three kilometres out into the sea
5152731 were handling ships as big as 80 000 tonnes these days
5152732 the rods made from scrap ships are inferior to those made by top steel producers but theyre at least 20 percent cheaper than high grade steel and therefore are overwhelmingly used in the countrys construction industry
5152733 back then we were paying 430 dollars a tonne about three months ago it was about 940 dollars a tonne but in may india introduced a 15 percent export tax and the price is now around 1 150 to 1 200 dollars
5152734 in the global context of rising costs every penny counts right now
5152735 its a very hazardous job our question is is the amount of steel supplied really enough compensation for the damage the industry is doing to workers and the environment
5152736 the ships are being recycled so we are helping the environment
5152737 we dont dump anything into the sea because everything is worth money so we sell it even the old oil
5152738 im always afraid of these sorts of accident on the other hand im more afraid of not getting money if i dont come to work

5152751 mi gobierno ser el mejor defensor de la iniciativa privada porque entiende que para repartir con equidad y justicia la riqueza primero hay que producirla y para ello necesitamos que los emprendedores privados y el estado sellen una fuerte alianza desde el inicio
5152752 por eso invitamos a todas las fuerzas pol ticas y sociales del pa s convencidas de la necesidad del cambio a sumar voluntades para alcanzar un entendimiento nacional que nos permita definir una estrategia nacional de desarrollo para asegurar la estabilidad y la certidumbre que el pa s requiere

5152979 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5152980 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5152981 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5152982 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5152983 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5152984 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5152985 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5152986 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5152987 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5152988 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5152989 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5152990 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5152991 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5152992 you dont have any idea what it means to them to be able to contest a final these guys heart and soul is in it and i knew that i had a special bunch when i went down there all these guys want is a chance of winning the
5152993 maybe we lacked that little killer punch or maybe the bit of experience of all ireland semi final day but you know you learn from that naturally were going to be very disappointed we were fully aware of the challenge today but we just came up short
5152994 there will be a few tears at the end of the day but there will be lots of stories great music a beer or two and maybe the odd cuban cigar
5152995 he brought great pleasure to the people of ireland and yet more around the world ronnie will be greatly missed by many but most particularly by his family with whom our thoughts are today
5152996 ronnie whether as part of the dubliners or during his solo career will also be remembered for his promotion of irish music both at home and around the world he bore his illness with bravery and will be sadly missed
5152997 his contribution to irish music and irish life was immeasurable and his influence will be felt for many many years to come
5152998 we have now lost three members of the original dubliners ronnie drew
5152999 the alarm was raised after crew members went to the engine room to carry out a check
5153000 the engine room was half full of water as a result the rescue services were alerted
5153001 rosslare harbour lifeboat along with waterford rescue helicopter arrived on the scene while there were two merchant vessels also standing by
5153002 the three men were taken from the vessel within seconds the vessel sank much more rapidly than expected
5153003 the three crew members were taken to rosslare harbour where they were looked after by local people before returning home later in the morning
5153004 the whole place was full of smoke i came out before they started knocking on doors
5153005 i heard the alarm go off but it goes off all the time there were three fire trucks i think but i dont know the people who were taken to hospital
5153006 he just made some mistakes early in the game and the guys hit him
5153007 otherwise that doesnt happen to him too often some days that happens
5153008 whenever you have a chance to get those pitchers out of the game quick its good to get to their bullpen and work their bullpen
5153009 it was a good day for everybody i guess that gave us a little more confidence
5153010 the fastballs he threw ran back over the middle they were elevated
5153011 we spent the majority of the day doing that they were pretty consistent in scoring
5153012 the way we came out swinging the bats against beckett today is a big lift for us
5153013 i think we thought today was going to be one of those games where one or two runs was going to be tough to come by to have our guys set the tone early was a big lift
5153014 i was very aggressive throwing the first pitch for strikes
5153015 that allowed me to go out there for the ninth i was just doing my job
5153016 he was adamant about going back out there which is always a good thing
5153017 were executing for the most part in different facets of the game those are still things you must do no matter who youre playing these are games you would like to win but its baseball so you never know
5153018 hitting in front of johan i didnt think i would get too many chances
5153019 too close to the puzzle to see the big picture
5153020 kick all of the widows orphans and old folks out in the street
5153021 in order to get them to pass the rest of his reforms he should let them have the pay raise
5153022 didnt agree with it and thought it was excessive but felt that he should keep his promise to them
5153023 yes thats true and its no reason to make marijuana illegal and have to deal with all the other problems of prohibition
5153024 no marijuana doesnt cause lung cancer and heres the proof but even if it did cause lung cancer it still wouldnt be a reason to make marijuana illegal and deal with all the other problems of prohibition

5153029 it was just a man to man coverage and jon put it in a perfect spot
5153030 there was a little contact jons putting it in the right places and were running our routes in the right places
5153031 if we keep getting protection like that we can do whatever we want weve passed the ball well the last two years and knew we were going to be able to throw the football but weve got to keep working on the running game to help our defense
5153032 our quarterback was touched a little bit more than were used to
5153033 we were a little bit out of sync in the passing game early
5153034 its a matter that the investigators have carefully considered on whether they should or should not release it

5153037 it was a shock when we found out that mr maguire had died so to then find out a second young man had been killed in afghanistan just left us numb
5153038 women start adult life happier than men but end up less happy
5153039 women are more likely than men to be in unions and this makes for greater fulfillment of both family life and material
5153040 its better to err on the side of caution than to blow a plane up
5153041 the expectation was that we would begin breaking ground in october 2007
5153042 now were looking at next fall but the amount well need to raise is 30 million due to inflation and the increased cost of materials
5153043 we used to take a deep breath in the summertime getting ready for our fall programming and the christmas kettle drive
5153044 our buildings are busy all year long so in all honesty we havent had the time to properly focus on going after the money we need we plan to do that soon though were expecting the bulk to come from companies businesses and foundations were also hopeful of receiving hundreds of thousands of nickels and dimes
5153045 i asked by the way colonel do you know that im a jew and would that be a problem
5153046 fred laughed and said no problem at all ive been working for one all my life
5153047 what were hoping to do is bring all of those communities together under one roof
5153048 when i realized i had this gift it was pretty wild and unexpected it came right out of the blue
5153049 but i now offer my services to police departments all the time im working on a case right now
5153050 it was like being hit between the eyes because id never done anything like that before they found him in the exact location i had given
5153051 he had no idea who i was or who i wanted to contact but he sat there and started pounding his chest and said that someone is telling him about holes in their chest
5153052 it was unbelievable he told me a lot of things he couldnt possibly have known and gave me messages from her
5153053 if not for chuck i dont think i would have ever got out of my grief
5153054 there are some very compelling cases that video game playing leads to advanced problem solving in math science and spatial skills
5153055 i noticed that invariably the doctors who played video games were better at surgery
5153056 i cant say im shocked games have definitely improved my concentration and reactions especially for driving
5153057 i dont understand i cant do that here in the united states
5153058 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5153059 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5153060 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5153061 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5153062 respectfully im going to disagree with you on mccain and his service
5153063 id like to give a shout out to team owner richie morris who couldnt be here because hes a bit under the weather i hope hes feeling better
5153064 early on we were worried about the tire wear on the front
5153065 we couldnt go the full fuel load on the tires so we had to go with a different pit strategy and run a fast enough pace to make up for the extra stop we were able to maintain a fast enough pace
5153066 we had the bike set up to run consistently through a whole stint
5153067 but i got a big leg cramp nine laps before the end of my stint and i was trying to work it out i wanted to make sure we got through the stint so we could stay on our three stop strategy but we lost about two seconds a lap there
5153068 weve been working working working and finally we managed to finish up here ive got to thank steve decamp and the whole team for all their hard work
5153069 i had heard they didnt have much crew and we made a point of changing tires on our second stop
5153070 i could see him filice sliding around and i knew i would be able to get around him
5153071 they the no 66 team gapped us a bit in the second stint
5153072 but then they went off the track and we were able to bring it home the bike was awesome the whole time at the end the tires were sketchy but we had fun
5153073 it was a good opportunity for us to go against a quality defense
5153074 i know they had some guys out but this team is a really good team and for us to come out and put a drive together to start the game was good for our confidence
5153075 i played with luke before so it was an opportunity for us to run some old plays
5153076 he and i played together in cleveland so we have a way of connecting i kind of had an idea he was going to throw it because of the way the coverage looked we just happened to make the play

5153080 they were skiing in the area when the brother who survived had gone around the side of the ice cornice
5153081 the 22 year old was on top of the ice cornice at that stage when his brother who was below noticed that it was unsafe and called out to him i presume he could see cracks or movement underneath
5153082 and as he attempted to move off the top of the cornice it collapsed underneath him
5153083 he was engulfed in the snow and ice as it swept him down the slope

5153108 looking at it now with all the things i had to learn and with all the work you have to put into it the film work studying the playbook and all of that i definitely think the pressure was probably a little too much

5153126 just last year the seven states entered into a new implementing agreement and that agreement is working as intended
5153127 it would be sheer folly to re open the compact at a time like this when all of the states are working cooperatively on this issue
5153128 senator mccains position on opening up the colorado river compact is absolutely wrong and would only happen over my dead body its an anathema to the fundamental principles of colorados water rights and our compacts

5153396 we expect a strong first first half 2008 09 having already had a good start to 2009 mainly driven by continued strong global steel demand and prices he said
5153397 realised prices in the first quarter will be slightly higher than last quarter
5153398 the pricing environment in the global steel market is offsetting those cost increases mr omalley said
5153399 as we move from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 our raw material costs specifically coal and iron ore will go by about up 1 2 billion
5153400 our total raw materials cost taking scrap and alloys into account will increase by about 1 6 billion
5153401 cost escalations are a challenge not just in australia but globally
5153402 well continue to work on cost reductions but productivity improvements are an important part of our business as well
5153403 in the next five years theres no reason why demand cant stay strong due to bric brazil russia india china economies he said
5153404 in china there may well be some slower growth but demand for steel continues to very strong
5153405 and weve still got russia and india going flat out
5153406 we see the supply and demand dynamic remaining quite tight
5153407 turning around the business in china and new zealand was
5153408 butler was a good acquisition imsa will be as well
5153409 there are some opportunities that weve seen coming out of the businesses in north america that were going to move across to asia

5153413 with five blokes to every girl may i suggest that beauty disadvantaged women should proceed to mount isa
5153414 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5153415 some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairy tale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
5153416 its not councils view and its not mine its hard when youve got to defend something someone else has said were definitely appalled
5153417 im told men outnumber women here by five to one if thats the case then perhaps its an opportunity for some lonely women

5153422 reclaiming public spaces as a space for public imagination and enlightenment where they have become propagandistic barriers to thought and awareness
5153423 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
5153424 i think perhaps we will need a stiff drink after that
5153425 i have in the last few months become more pessimistic than the consensus
5153426 i am in favor for example of limits on late term abortions if there is an exception for the mothers health
5153427 from the perspective of those who are pro life i think they would consider that inadequate and i respect their views what i can do is say there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies so that we actually are reducing the sense that women are seeking out abortions
5153428 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies thats my commitment thats my commitment to you
5153429 i believe they were wrong and i strongly support preserving unique states of marriage between man and woman and im a federalist i believe that states should make those decisions
5153430 if a federal court decided that my state of arizona had to observe what the state of massachusetts decided then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the state should make the decisions within their own states
5153431 because historically we have not defined marriage in our constitution
5153432 john and i serve in the senate together so we see each other all the time
5153433 it was great to see him as he said hell see me in a couple weeks were going to be debating each other throughout the fall
5153434 he stood there and a minute later he rubbed it out and walked away
5153435 for a minute there there were just two christians worshipping together ill never forget that moment
5153436 acting justly and loving mercy and walking humbly with our god
5153437 it gives me the confidence to try things including things like running for president where you are going to screw up once in a while
5153438 which existing supreme court justices would you not have nominated

5153499 he cannot ever be trusted to speak authoritatively on health care ever again
5153500 it would grow exponentially and you have to find that money every year going forward if he says he can do it with anything other than a tax increase hes lying

5153507 in framing a government which is to be administered by men over men the great difficulty lies in this you must first enable the government to control the governed and in the next place oblige it to control itself

5153518 after a few months of ushering i was asked to hand out programs at the doors
5153519 before long i volunteered to take over the administrative coaching position for snt
5153520 i would encourage anyone thinking of getting involved in ministry to take that first step i had asked god to show me what my spiritual gifts were and he eventually showed me but the first time i signed up to usher i certainly didnt think my spiritual gift would have anything to do with walking a bag down an aisle
5153521 dikalangan mereka yang kering daripada sebarang manfaat dan ditengah jiwa jiwa yang benar itu terdengar suatu suara yang kuat melaung dikalangan hadirin yang hadir bertanya tetapi apakah yang menyebabkan kelemahan ukhuwwah dikalangan kami
5153522 pelbagai jawapan timbul daripada lisan lisan mereka diantara mereka ada yang berpendapat ia berpunca daripada kesibukan dengan kehidupan dan mengatakan bahawa kehidupan sekarang telah menjadi lebih kompleks daripada sebelumnya dan tanggungjawab semakin hari semakin banyak dari waktu yang ada
5153523 sekiranya inilah yang merupakan sebab sebab hakiki yang sebenar kepada masalah ini bermakna hilanglah impian untuk mengembalikan semula ikatan ukhuwwah yang kuat lambat laun tasbih ini akan terputus terus

5153540 i definitely conclude the threat is greater and is increasing every year with the march of technology
5153541 the scenarios we discuss today are so hard for us to contemplate and so emotionally traumatic that it is tempting to push them aside however now is the time to have this difficult conversation to ask the tough questions then to get answers

5153546 india is playing a significant role in global aids vaccine discovery efforts given our strong medical and scientific capabilities there is a need for continued efforts for the creation of novel reliable mechanisms for long term research on aids vaccines and other new prevention technologies
5153547 consistent innovation in science despite setbacks has ensured the development of many effective prevention technologies the successful conduct of the trial in chennai re affirms the need for continued vaccine development initiatives where learnings from every effort will contribute to global advancement of the aids vaccine field

5153562 jesse is a bigger than life personality and there is always an advantage of having a brand name like his attached to a show
5153563 that personality could especially work well in the court genre where he could break through in a crowded field needless to say it would be hard to confuse him with the other judges
5153564 celebrity circus i think because viewers dont want to see a circus they prefer a sideshow it would have been more interesting if they could have shown how many d level celebrities you can fit into a little car
5153565 this year will be more highlight driven as we focus on the journeys of some of the contestants from seasons three and four who became household names
5153566 with some of the names ranging from jennifer hudson and fantasia to carrie underwood and bo bice coming out of these shows there is a lot of fun stuff for us to explore where you get to see the best and worst of idol including cult favorite william hung
5153567 distribution of the series has been great and we expect to be above 95 for the new season
5153568 stations are excited about the changes to the show and tracy is putting together a more complete book as we rewind the journeys of people that audiences care about
5153569 carrie walks us through her idol experience from her audition to her win and discusses with us the highs and lows she went through as part of the process
5153570 she gets very specific with her greatest challenges and uncertain nights as well as what she thought about the competition
5153571 is the era of deregulation over for broadcasters the answer is yes
5153572 however it was already pretty clear that the environment will change whether barack obama or john mccain becomes president
5153573 we will have to make an even stronger case that broadcasters are where americans turn first for local news and information
5153574 we will protect the internets traditional openness and ensure that it remains a dynamic platform for free speech innovation and creativity
5153575 we will strengthen privacy protections in the digital age and will harness the power of technology to hold government and business accountable for violations of personal privacy
5153576 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
5153577 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future there are already drugs that inhibit particular ptks in the late stages of treatment our discovery could change the timing of when and how those or similar drugs are administered
5153578 our studies have shown that ptk pathways are intimately associated with the regulation of checkpoint responses during dna replication
5153579 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication they may lack a key enzyme called tcptp
5153580 to crack down on those terrorist activities in accordance with laws is conducive to uniting the chinese people and safeguarding national unification

5153587 there is no such notion any more in georgia as russian peacekeepers there can be no russian peacekeepers these are just russian forces
5153588 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5153589 russia overreached used disproportionate force against a small neighbour and is now paying the price
5153590 russias reputation as a potential partner in international institutions diplomatic political security economic is frankly in tatters
5153591 i have signed three decrees including one on the resignation of the government another on proclamation of a state of emergency in south ossetia and the third on setting up an emergency committee to settle the consequences of the georgian aggression
5153592 the russian troops are starting to pull out and russian peacekeepers are coming in
5153593 the studios and the guys who produce tv content and film content arent going to be the ones to build studios that are successful on the web
5153594 they dont know the rules of the web the ones that are going to be successful are the ones that know how to build a community and engage and interact
5153595 oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god they didnt win it she lost it
5153596 does this make sense are we over complicating it or under complicating it what is the balance between the athleticism of the sport and the emotion of the sport
5153597 oh come on they all should have been in shorts and what kind of ridiculous things
5153598 wow if only we had really put out a gallery of the history of opening ceremony outfits
5153599 no youre never going to be a lawyer not until you get your offensive term deleted together
5153600 im really pleased that the final season of this great show is going to be sponsored by bud
5153601 i think budweiser is wisely recognizing that their consumers are not just casual viewers of the shield but genuine fans
5153602 now its wall to wall we cant hold on to the ad units
5153603 i think back to my days when i was at abc when we had nypd blue in the first season nobody wanted to run in it
5153604 with each successive year they got more and more people into the show
5153605 i think you can certainly say that the world has changed and that whats permissible now is very different than it was years ago
5153606 but we all have to be mindful of whats on and is it appropriate for our clients to be in and that varies by client
5153607 from the beginning when the show was kind of taboo for cable they were one of the big supporters
5153608 anheuser busch will be in almost every break youll have a real sense its show youre going to clearly know that
5153609 we would only do it in a way that added authenticity to the show so that if someone was drinking beer at the bar when vic went to go hound him you could use actual budweiser rather than having to mock up something that looked fake
5153610 but we never got in the position where any character on the show was seen to be endorsing something which was a big distinction for me
5153611 the audience sniffs that stuff out and resents that kind of thing and we never got into that on the shield
5153612 new the on on town gene miller town the kelly youtube town york
5153613 the the young quotes from notebook quotes history quotes sparks notebook
5153614 she said you can have them for good luck and obviously its working
5153615 i wanted to look good out here because im going to be on camera
5153616 you know were all wearing them and were all together that gives us strength
5153617 should someone ask me whether i would indicate the west such as it is today as a model to my country frankly i would have to answer negatively
5153618 the western world has lost its civil courage both as a whole and separately in each country and of course in the united nations such a decline is especially notable among ruling groups and the intellectual elite they get tongue tied and paralyzed when they deal with powerful governments and threatening forces with aggressors and international terrorists
5153619 every citizen has been granted the desired freedom and material goods in such quantity and of such quality as to guarantee in theory the pursuit of happiness so why and for what should one risk ones precious life in defense of common values and particularly in such nebulous cases when the security of ones nation must be defended in a distant country
5153620 people in the west has acquired considerable skill in using interpreting and manipulating law if one is right from a legal point of view nothing more is required nobody might mention that one could still not be entirely right and urge a willingness to show restraint or sacrifice everybody operates at the extreme limits of those legal frames a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed but a society with no other scale but the legal one is not quite worthy of man either
5153621 legal frames especially in the united states are broad enough to encourage not only individual freedom but also certain individual crimes the culprit can go unpunished or obtain undeserved leniency with the support of legions of public defenders when a government starts an earnest fight against terrorism public opinion immediately accuses it of violating the terrorists civil rights there are many such cases
5153622 most successful game shows have changed and morphed their look over time and i think weve gotten a little too comfortable over here as well
5153623 this show was always designed to look slick and the time was right to take our unique space and evolve it into something even more exciting
5153624 although the clock does add pressure to the contestants that was not the intention of the move
5153625 we wanted to build energy inside the show because the amount of time a contestant can take can often deflate the momentum the show has been building this will now immediately make the show more contemporary and makes it easier for meredith
5153626 we really took a good look at the lifelines we already had and modernized them
5153627 we quickly got rid of 50 50 as it was always the most unpopular lifeline on millionaire then we noted the switch the question was not helping the contestants much by replacing it with ask the expert we were able to create a truly effective lifeline that also looks very modern and different and cool
5153628 all of these add up to only a little change for the show but they each add a dramatic impact to what viewers will see
5153629 and it really got good again already contestants have won more money through this point of our tapings than i can remember having before and other countries airing the show already want to add these changes into their own versions as well

5153637 it recaps the cliffhangers and cues up what will happen next
5153638 the campaign is sort of a mantra for broadcast television
5153639 we know theres this pent up demand for quality scripted tv and were playing on that

5153643 la victoria no cambia nada en realidad todav a creo que estoy mejorando y aprendiendo m s sobre el equipo y el coche en cada carrera mi objetivo para la ltima parte de la temporada es ganar m s carreras y estar luchando regularmente con los chicos de delante

5153646 the kids just love him hes been a great dog it was pretty brutal because he is just a little guy
5153647 it was a while before we noticed things were missing then we noticed the window ajar downstairs
5153648 those guys either kicked him pretty hard or picked him up and threw him into the wall
5153649 apparently the camp they are on is so large that it has its own fire department
5153650 wed seen pictures of the guys doing operations drilling and practicing and the equipment they use
5153651 you see one or two guys with turnout gear on and the rest of them just have fatigues
5153652 if you put the word out that there are things that are needed the fire companies usually and always do come through
5153653 its great to see the fire companies support the troops that are over there volunteering themselves
5153654 while on duty at the concert series thats become a pretty popular area in lieu of a rest room

5153658 i said to the group i want to see the side evolve when it is not going their way
5153659 i spoke about climbing over the mountain when it gets a little bit tough to get out of situations finding out about each other
5153660 i thought at times the players were not demanding enough of each other when st kilda were just kicking the ball around
5153661 that results in uncontested marks and an easy path to goals
5153662 as i said to the group after the game look no further than yourself ask yourself what happened and what can be the difference in performance from one week to the next
5153663 the game is not that difficult from a basic thing like manning up when they have got the ball
5153664 at times you are not going to finish up on your direct opponent but it is how you cover for each other
5153665 we had too many guys sit back and be spectators when that happened
5153666 if you want blu ray go get blu ray this product is meant to improve playback of dvds

5153668 a lot of people feel that if they have a couple drinks in them it gets them a little loosened up but i think a lot of people pace themselves
5153669 we have people playing with water at some of the tournaments everyone has a different strategy some people like to drink a lot
5153670 the best thing is not worrying about anything else thats going on in the room
5153671 just get in the zone aim at that cup perfect your stroke and you got it
5153672 if everyone shows up at the door they might not be able to get in
5153673 theres a lot of testosterone in the room so we hire some cute girls to walk around the room help with the games its a party atmosphere instead of just a straight up sporting event we try to make it as fun as possible

5153684 this election season youre not just choosing a president youre choosing an election team that tells you who to choose for president
5153685 no other broadcast network is going to have the time to put the coverage in the proper perspective
5153686 i think were giving people things that ill bet you they want thats purely why were doing it
5153687 theres a point at which you sit there and go television can be important and can be meaningful and it doesnt always have to be about an argument
5153688 lording over the activity from a hermetically sealed sky booth
5153689 i think its safe to say we will have the most complete coverage
5153690 were going all out were bringing nbc news to the convention cities
5153691 you dont have to click back and forth you dont have to watch gavel to gavel and then go back to where theyre yelling and screaming or whatever
5153692 everything we do on the program will have a plus to it
5153693 providing pockets in school uniforms to conceal these items is tantamount to legitimising the flouting of school rules

5153697 this research will give us information that allows us to identify what treatment is going to be effective in what individual by genotype by obesity and other factors what kind of treatment is going to be effective at keeping an individuals blood pressure down or maybe preventing it from ever getting high
5153698 we were surprised by the severity of the residual sleep apnea in postoperative patients
5153699 the majority of individuals still had moderate to severe osa
5153700 the second surprising finding of this study was that despite the persistence and severity of the most people thought their sleep apnea was resolved after their weight loss and only a few still used cpap
5153701 we are delivering on our commitment to be the leading innovator and challenger in the australian telecommunications market
5153702 the strong growth in naked dsl providing customers with broadband speeds of up to 24 megabits per second mbps without the added costs of a fixed phone line is a clear demonstration of our innovation attracting new customers

5153704 at avemco were concerned about the low rate of student starts the shortage of cfis and the overall low level of flying activity across the marketplace our hope is to facilitate an increase in the number of qualified experienced flight instructors available to the general aviation community offering more options for people seeking any form of flight instruction
5153705 we want the kids to have a good time and really experience airventure

5153709 if they offer me the job i will take it
5153710 if you want to kill this thing individualise it around johnny de lange put me on a pedestal and say this thing wont work without johnny de lange
5153711 i believe that this new coordinating role requires someone who is very dynamic and i believe johnny de lange is that person
5153712 we have the legacy we have the present and were also talking about the future
5153713 a lot of questions we get is whats the difference between the air national guard and the air force reserve and the active duty and air national guard
5153714 a lot of times were known as the hometown air force we have deep ties with the community
5153715 today its awareness with the public to show them all aspects of the air force since it is a total force and to bring that awareness that were all interwoven we all have the same rank structure the same type of training ones just more of a part time component as opposed to a full time component
5153716 since its air force week the kids said we have to go to the air and space museum and here we are
5153717 i think its a neat insight to air force operations since were navy and we live the navy life to be stationed here and get to see it in further detail is great
5153718 we get to mix in with the kids and the crowds and they get to see what we do on a daily basis
5153719 i love being out here letting the people come through and see what the medical field is all about in the air force
5153720 we wanted to make sure people see our equipment and understand our capabilities
5153721 people pretty much understand this is just a big shower we use to get people clean before we treat them
5153722 i have come only for the lost sheep of israel
5153723 it isnt right to take the food meant for the children and give it to dogs
5153724 yes but even the dogs get what is left by the children at the table
5153725 we didnt verify their details so they need to call back to verify those details the spokeswoman said
5153726 if the president and sen mccain werent so obsessed on an open ended commitment to iraq perhaps we would have paid greater attention to some of these issues
5153727 one of the questions this crisis raises is who do you want sitting across the table from vladimir putin and people like him john mccain or sen obama
5153728 reduce tensions avoid the risks of war and re engage in peaceful negotiations
5153729 didnt need to get briefed on south ossetia and georgia to make his statement about what ought to be done there
5153730 he knew immediately what ought to be done because hes been there time and again hes been to the region time and again hes been to south ossetia he knows the characters involved and so he was able to move immediately and with strength and with a definition of the issue that others had to follow
5153731 teddy roosevelt said talk softly and carry a big stick
5153732 in much of the world now were talking loudly and have no stick because what weve done is weve so focused on iraq that weve let victory escape from our grasp in afghanistan and in regions of the world like russia weve let the dangers grow more intense
5153733 our passing game has not been as consistent with him out
5153734 he definitely adds a spark and is a player we need back
5153735 each and every player knows whats going on and didnt take too much of it to heart
5153736 but as long as he shuts up and produces thats all that matters
5153737 chad being chad hes been loony and kooky since hes been here were much better if hes on our team
5153738 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5153739 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5153740 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5153741 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5153742 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5153743 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5153744 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5153745 realizado agress es e amea as contra trabalhadores assim como danos aos ve culos equipamentos maquinarias e materiais de propriedade privada

5153747 the need to upgrade the quality of human agents through appropriate investment in health education and nutrition
5153748 command over financial savings of the community at largely negative real rates of interest
5153749 level of efficiency in the operation and maintenance of the public sector
5153750 the type of managerial culture that is needed to realize a higher level of productivity of capital and labour cannot be reached with the present style of running public enterprises
5153751 its not a bad word you can say it i see it as another excuse to have a birthday party
5153752 physically i feel stronger now than maybe 20 years ago but i think your physicality is connected to your consciousness so if your mind is strong your body will be strong
5153753 wanted the whole world to know who i was to love me and be affected by me
5153754 dont stop me now dont need to catch my breath
5153755 so what are you going to do when you get older madonna are you going to be going on 50 and still get up onstage and shake your booty like cher what happens when your body goes
5153756 though i have fears i think truthfully im going to live to be a very old age if what ive gone through hasnt killed me yet nothings going to thats my bleeping opinion
5153757 receiving income on your home in the form of housing services
5153758 the percentage of paid for homes in foreclosure is zero
5153759 receiving income on your home in the form of housing services
5153760 when people go to watch video they really have to focus on a certain part of the screen and by having these ads in the area you know where people are looking
5153761 while third screen media has already been bought and enpocket has already been bought the question isnt which ones will be bought but which ones wont be bought
5153762 today we see a lot of little startups that specialize in mobile
5153763 a lot of the mature advertising networks on the desktop internet what if these guys decide to get into this business too wouldnt they crush the little guys we dont know so far its a very tough environment to be in and its so early
5153764 strategically online networks feel the need to be involved in mobile
5153765 google already offers local spot tv spot radio spot newspaper ads it would be a natural extension for them to offer mobile if that becomes a viable delivery channel
5153766 some of the ad networks are going to rise to the top and some are not going to be successful the ones that know how to work with publishers deliver campaigns are the ones that are going to really shine
5153767 consequently our definition of mobile advertising and marketing is quite different than one off impressions and landing pages that mobile ad networks offer today
5153768 wap banner ads dont generally offer that much more specialized a product in terms of feature and functionality than traditional online networks
5153769 in fact they often offer less information than traditional ad networks given the limitations of wap and the capabilities there what they do offer is some specialized targeting and demographic information that is harder to get from online networks so they fit a niche
5153770 they mobile ad networks have been the most aggressive in canvassing the market providing the education and trying to make the buying and managing mobile manageable
5153771 this is important if you are trying to drive the user to a site or application that will only work on a specific phone or with a certain carrier if we wanted to drive consumers to a mobile site that had video we would target accordingly and avoid bad consumer experiences
5153772 by targeting only smart phones layered within content buckets that our target is more likely to be reading we have seen some great interactions from the clicks that have come from the buys
5153773 mobile is a distinct channel and needs to be treated as such
5153774 we believe we have solutions that cut across many platforms at once rather than platform by platform basis
5153775 one of my favorite people of all time is ms
5153776 so i wish all the best all the happiness all the joy that comes with that certificate just the joy of being able to stand up and say that in front of everyone you love and care about in front of each other and to walk away legal is huge
5153777 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5153778 ive got more than 1 200 items and its anything that i find a bit peculiar rather than something that would have been successful or other people would collect i dont collect sewing machines or typewriters
5153779 its things that perhaps nobody else would be bothered with but in some way helped normal people with their lives like the self pouring teapot or the dynamo torch
5153780 a lot of the items could still be produced today even the self pouring teapot
5153781 why would you want to do that why not just blow on it and it displaces half your coffee
5153782 britain was a phenomenal nation of inventors but things have changed
5153783 nowadays its got to be manufactured abroad and the system of selling has become quite difficult i think 1851 to 1951 was the golden age
5153784 inventors are all quite vulnerable and naive at the beginning we really need advice so its great to have somewhere to go
5153785 you have to be pretty determined and it helps if you have some basic skills
5153786 im here to nurture inventors and point them in the right direction you never know whats coming through the door
5153787 were a different breed from the victorians we have to be more commercially viable
5153788 youve got to go through a process and its not always easy
5153789 today is saturday the sunday paper is not delivered until sunday

5153793 its not up to us who he dates its up to him
5153794 weve been running well lately really since we got to englishtown back in june so to cap off this weekend by somehow miraculously getting into the showdown was really a big deal for this team
5153795 we were so far behind in that thing that 8th place was over the horizon and six time zones away but we kept scratching and clawing all summer and all of sudden it was right here in front of us this weekend at the last race before indy
5153796 that got us all pumped up for sunday too and we came out here this morning with a great attitude and a lot of focus weve been running well all summer really but not catching many breaks so we came to the track this morning with the attitude that wed have to create our own breaks and we came out here to run a bunch of ex teammates we cant seem to get away from until we ran in round two we hadnt lined up against anyone but bob tasca for what seemed like forever
5153797 basically we had to leave here with a net gain on at least one of those guys hopefully in the 60 to 80 point range and i kind of thought it might be beckman we could chase because his ladder was just stunningly hard
5153798 when you wake up on sunday and see that jack had to race wilkerson in round one and then probably john force in round two you think maybe that part of the deal will go your way that was an enormous mountain to climb so give jack and his team all the credit they deserve because they took out some huge hitters to eliminate us from the countdown they earned every bit of it
5153799 there are still seven races left and the way were running thats seven more chances to wear the cool hats in the winners circle
5153800 we know we cant win the championship but we also know we can win races plus we earned a shot at the showdown money and thats something to be very proud of were a little disappointed that all the wrong numbers added up today but were feeling good about how we can finish this season were going to be a factor in how it all shakes out im sure of that
5153801 implemented a policy of avoiding ignoring and covering up complaints including those relating to physical and sexual abuse by officers

5153804 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5153805 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5153806 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5153807 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5153808 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5153809 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5153810 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5153811 really i was gonna buy a snow globe for my mom

5153824 and one more thing clean up this place its smells like a city dump
5153825 you can double quit rates with a telephone quitline and a free patch
5153826 older smokers are motivated to quit and that quitlines and pharmacotherapy greatly increase the odds of successfully quitting
5153827 what we dont know is how much money this really saves if saving money is your goal
5153828 if you just look at it from a strict budget perspective its not going to save medicare a lot one way or another
5153829 mommy we are going to have a concert on saturday

5153833 i think maybe this will take longer than we have tonight
5153834 when i write it down what will you do with it
5153835 that equals out to about a medal and a half for each hour he spent in combat there were infantry guys grunts on the ground who had more than 7 000 hours in combat and i can tell you that there were times and situations where im sure a prison cell would have looked pretty good to them by comparison the question really is how many guys got that number of medals for not being shot down
5153836 i think chinese rowing has made rapid progress in recent years but we are lagging behind in terms of experience
5153837 although it looked like we were ahead and in control we were in constant fear
5153838 ive seen him get out of jams so much this season when the game is on the line you see the best joe nathan
5153839 win or lose they keep fighting to the end so ive been satisfied with their effort the execution is something we just have to improve on
5153840 for me federer is still technically the best he is the best player in the history of tennis
5153841 if federer can improve i can too for sure i can improve the serve 100 percent i can improve my volley im happy but its important to be humble if you want to continue improving
5153842 i have very good people around me so nothing will change
5153843 i was happy at number two im happy to be number one
5153844 we have taken statements from the teacher and students who lodged police reports but referred the matter to the education department for further action
5153845 the teacher would not face any charges as police did not consider the incident as a criminal case
5153846 were not as concerned about it as we initially were
5153847 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5153848 the rumor of auschwitz the problem of the gas chambers
5153849 the value of the impact from our advertising campaign with park has increased by 10 fold
5153850 i think it was sherman who said im not running and i wont serve if im elected
5153851 with one year left theyre racing against the clock and hoping they can chisel around the edges and reduce the numbers
5153852 there are like 300 plus people looking at two jobs
5153853 i would never use it but i guess im hypercautious
5153854 without a deposit slip how does it get identified as going to your account i think of all the things that could go wrong mechanically
5153855 what a tasteful chinese businessman living in paris would have built in the 1910s but then aged to 1940
5153856 people are always asking me how can someone with graduate degrees and who is a liberal go into the service
5153857 this is a question i never get in the midwest or the south my response is you and i are on a social contract credit card so why in other parts of the country do we try to pay down that debt for you its something incomprehensible for me its something i was raised with
5153858 theyre often poor they value education obligation the social contract
5153859 at least hes not like im going to fuck up some afghanis
5153860 lance the towering stone faced doorman and a fellow guardsman has shihs back
5153861 unless youve been there going against hajji you dont understand
5153862 80 percent of the kids have food allergies 10 percent of them life threatening the dairy peanuts

5153904 one of our bedrock privacy principles is transparency by which we mean that we are upfront with our users about what information we collect and how we use it so that they can make informed choices about their personal information
5153905 ensuring that we earn and keep our users trust is an essential constant for building the best possible products
5153906 with every google product we work hard to earn and keep that trust with a long standing commitment to protect the privacy of our users personal information

5153909 we also believe that a strong and easy to find mechanism to permit consumers to opt out of this type of data collection is a goal that all companies should aspire to achieve
5153910 opt out mechanisms for online advertising are often buried in fine print difficult to understand hard to execute and technically inadequate
5153911 moreover in most cases opt out mechanisms offered for behavioral advertising only opt a user out of receiving targeted ads but do not opt the user out of data collection about his or her internet usage
5153912 individual web sites and search engines and their affiliates that monitor users also owe consumers constructive notice of such activities and the right to limit or thwart any personal data collection

5153944 theres always an increase in family tensions anytime there are financial hardships
5153945 in many cases that tension turns into violence against one or more members of the family
5153946 they are unhappy when they lose their job or cant make the house payment or pay their bills that frustration can manifest itself in violence against the partner
5153947 found a strong link between intimate violence and the economic well being of couples and the communities in which they live
5153948 when there are other stress factors it certainly can contribute to the escalation of violence
5153949 we believe very firmly that when there are economic stresses it contributes to more anxiety to the relationship

5153954 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5153955 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5153956 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5153957 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5153958 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5153959 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5153960 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5153961 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5153962 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5153963 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5153964 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five

5153983 i would like to play on the stanford university baseball team
5153984 the similarity with last year is that we have hard working kids and we have jacket pride
5153985 the players are still athletic hard working kids there are few differences in their style of play or their work ethics
5153986 i dont see any difference in the rivalry between when he wilkes was there and with brent
5153987 thats a bitter rivalry coach david will find that out the week before our game and itll start building
5153988 yeah i have big shoes fill i was fortunate that i was able to work one year with him i learned a lot about coaching hes a great motivator he treats the coaches and kids fairly and i learned a lot about how to deal with kids here under keith thats helped the transition
5153989 we have a good nucleus coming back kids with experience
5153990 our senior class has done a great job in the classroom theyve really been mature in the classroom as a whole and that carries over into the weight room and practice
5153991 talented athletic and smart he has high character we feel good about the quarterback position
5153992 samquan evans is one of the best defensive linemen ive coached in a long time

5153995 this is one of the best conferences in the state top to bottom
5153996 the conference has a lot of good football players and several go to division i each year
5153997 were the same offensively and defensively but the key is we have more experience
5153998 he has an excellent arm and he reads defenses well hes a three year starter and experience is a big help in the spread
5153999 were not bad but youve got to play the games weve got to be disciplined and play hard
5154000 yes i think well be much improved weve improved each year
5154001 our seniors came in as freshmen thisll be their fourth year and i think the work theyve done will transfer from the weight room and our speed program to the football field
5154002 well continue with the foundation we started building last year
5154003 were building a strong foundation and will take it from day to day
5154004 it just costs so much to raise a child nowadays

5154012 my initial thoughts are that the touch pro is an extremely nice device the screen seems to be more sensitive than the touch diamond and it looks like htc have spent the extra time with the pro refining a few things

5154016 one of the desired outcomes of this is that our future military leaders will be fully cognizant not only of their authority but also of their responsibility to make decisions that are well considered and morally sound
5154017 we do not observe compliance to authority merely because it is a transient cultural or historical phenomenon but because it flows from the logical necessities of social organization
5154018 georgia the 3 a m call for obama amp mccain
5154019 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5154020 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5154021 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5154022 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5154023 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5154024 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5154025 nazario said that he was asked are they dead yet
5154026 ive put in applications everywhere for everything but nobody wants to hire you if you have been indicted
5154027 my faith in the system is shaken theres no doubt about that
5154028 there are no bodies no forensic evidence no crime scene and no identities
5154029 of course when youre training your whole life to get to the olympics you train for gold
5154030 but honestly a silver around my neck three times at the olympics means more to me than anything
5154031 i am not as excited as i was when i won the mens team gold medal
5154032 because we finally released the pressure that had built up for so many years
5154033 to make it here and make a mistake is hard but she did a great job no matter what shes one of the most respected gymnasts out there
5154034 i knew izbasa had beaten me in prelims so i was a little more nervous
5154035 i had a little bit of hope inside me but seeing how beautifully she did her routine i knew
5154036 i was very nervous when i was watching the other gymnasts competing after me
5154037 this is a competition so two or three mistakes are pretty common however i was struggling during that 10 minutes i was worried that i couldnt get the gold medal
5154038 i felt comfortable out there and i just had to buckle down on the back nine
5154039 i told myself on the next tee box ive got my momentum and ive got to put pressure on scott and hit a great tee shot
5154040 i let the tournament slip away on 10 and 11 and hit a poor tee shot on 12 and was looking at another bogey
5154041 i managed to hit it to maybe 20 feet and my caddie gave me a great read and i made a nice positive stroke and i think that was the turning point
5154042 this will hopefully build for the next few weeks with the playoffs coming up
5154043 i know how to win i just didnt get it done today
5154044 coach is really the one that found me when i was playing junior golf here in north carolina
5154045 ive got a great relationship with tim and coach i feel a little bit for tim hes a great player and he hasnt won yet on the pga tour im sure he might win next week and probably get inspired by this
5154046 hes actually staying at my house so well probably have a few beverages later on to celebrate

5154048 they were skiing in the area when the brother who survived had gone around the side of the ice cornice inspector peter rooney of cooma police said
5154049 the 22 year old was on top of the ice cornice at that stage when his brother who was below noticed that it was unsafe and called out to him i presume he could see cracks or movement underneath he said
5154050 and as he attempted to move off the top of the cornice it collapsed underneath him
5154051 he was engulfed in the snow and ice as it swept him down the slope

5154058 i think the story that has not been told is stories like mine in which the home battle that was waged shall we say helped open the door so that the unit could enter combat and demonstrate its capabilities and be successful
5154059 so many want the movies to focus in that sense and thats bitter history that has been thoroughly emphasized and publicized
5154060 balances difficult and painful issues with what is at its heart the story of men with a dream to fly and serve their country
5154061 it is a story of incredible adventure and enormous courage
5154062 i think the story will speak to anyone who has ever wanted to succeed at something others told them was impossible

5154070 basically we just overpowered the track a little bit obviously we didnt have lane choice but we were comfortable with the 4 16 we ran yesterday in the last session of qualifying third quickest of that session and we actually ran it in the same right lane the lane of choice became the left lane today i thought it was free and clear where it got in trouble and the track just wouldnt hold it we were trying to run a high teen now that weve clinched a place in the countdown we can continue to implement some of these things weve been trying to test for later in the season its part of getting better and trying to find that edge you cant find that edge if you dont step over it once in a while and thats what we have to do i feel very good going into the u s nationals in two weeks were in the showdown 100 000 bonus event that weekend and we have a very tough match up first round with points leader tim wilkerson there i feel like we have a great car going into indy
5154071 weve been flirting with a win for awhile now and it feels wonderful to get it done
5154072 the main thing is we want to carry momentum into indy and then the playoffs and theres no better way to build up momentum than to go out there and turn the win light on great work by the entire jegs com chevrolet cobalt team
5154073 i started the day thinking we had a top five car but the race against v ill tell ya he gave us all we could handle
5154074 we were like the 14th quickest of the round and we only beat v by two thousandths of a second but to get a break like that really lifted us up it set the tome for the day
5154075 i dont know if my rep had much to do with it
5154076 i havent exactly been sawing the tree down lately its more likely that we won because we did the best job as a team of adapting to the racetrack throughout the day
5154077 we want to win our fifth championship this year and the closer we are to the no 1 spot when the playoffs start the better it will be we moved up to third today and we could mathematically get as high as second in indy so thats what well try to do weve been talking about getting that look back in our eye and i think we did that a little bit today
5154078 it appears that the federal government is starting to recognise that more staff are needed to get its massive job done cpsu national secretary stephen jones said
5154079 if government is serious about solving some of the countrys biggest challenges it needs to make sure it does not burn out its best talent
5154080 it needs to ensure that it has an adequately funded and properly resourced public service to get the job done

5154086 true leaders will take responsibility for all consequences of their decisions even the bad ones even when the results were the fault of a subordinate a true leader will still take all the blame

5154097 commodity prices are firmer this morning and thats generally treated as a negative for the us dollar
5154098 ms mckay was the first to be killed he told the court
5154099 there was tape wrapped all the way around her head
5154100 a bit of wire made like a noose wrapped around his neck and kim snibson stood on his back and pulled it up lea caton told the court
5154101 within a few weeks well have the nfl and college football and the homestretch of baseball
5154102 olympic athletes by and large have very short cycles in which they can generate revenues as sponsors
5154103 hes reached a level that no olympic athlete has ever achieved
5154104 i could see over four years him making 40 to 50 million those are big big numbers
5154105 hes not going to just fall into a black hole
5154106 i think after the games youll see him have sustainability and dont forget hell be competing in london in 2012
5154107 the image of phelps cheering the relay i think it did more for him than any single moment
5154108 his individual accomplishments stand on their own but that human side of him is most appealing
5154109 just the idea of cheering so hard for his teammates transcends what sports are all about it transcends that hes not only a great competitor but a great teammate
5154110 im in it because i love what i do it was something i dreamed of as soon as i started swimming winning an olympic gold medal and in athens i was able to do that ive been able to surpass my goals
5154111 im having fun at what i do and i do it because i love it im living sort of a dream world sometimes you have to pinch yourself to see if its really real
5154112 obviously the guys perfect for ipod its always in his ear
5154113 any kind of video games i hear hes a big video game player
5154114 if anyone can keep the momentum going in 2009 and 10 and 11
5154115 hes good looking healthy vital pure its sort of a clich of what america is about
5154116 in that sense he represents a gold mine to marketers this guy kind of comes out of the blue and sort of says when we were an innocent land and things were simpler and less complex this is the image america had beyond being an athlete he conveys the possibility that america can be that kind of place again
5154117 the mystery of china combined with the unbelievable phenomenon of michael phelps the terrific performances by gymnasts nastia liukin and shawn johnson and defending olympic gold medalists misty may treanor and kerry walsh at beach volleyball have captivated the imagination of the country
5154118 what phelps provided in beijing was more than just sustained excellence he provided the kind of theater that none of us will soon if ever forget
5154119 that is the kind of feat that just may never be surpassed and certainly one of the greatest feats of sports history
5154120 the sport of swimming will never be the same the name michael phelps will be synonymous with perfection
5154121 an extraordinary chapter in olympic history has been written here in beijing by one of the greatest athletes of all time we could not be more proud of michael in the manner by which he competed represented our country and represented the olympic movement the fact that his eighth medal was won in a team relay signifies michaels commitment not only to his own quest but to the importance of teamwork and representing his country
5154122 it is fitting that at one of the most significant events of our generation we have witnessed one of the greatest performances in olympic history michaels record breaking performance during these games will inspire millions of people around the world to reach for their goals and aspire to greatness he is an example of the very best values of the olympic movement and our country
5154123 if you can handle eight gold medals you can handle anything
5154124 behind every champion theres a mother and what better way to honor moms everywhere than to name debbie phelps johnsons r baby mom of the olympic games
5154125 debbie represents every mother that has helped her child to succeed whether in simply learning how to take those first steps or winning olympic gold we are thrilled to partner with her to celebrate and thank moms around the world
5154126 it is a wonderful honor to be named johnsons r baby mom of the olympic games
5154127 as i look back one of the hardest things i had to do with raising my son and both my two daughters was to trust they would be okay without me always by their side as they grew older like all mothers we just want our children to be happy safe and to excel in what they enjoy most and as a mom we do everything we can to make that possible
5154128 anecdotally people are saying that 75 dollars is what it costs to rear a 17 kilogram lamb so unless prices are over that its not exactly profitable i dont think anyones going to be jumping for joy theyre probably going to be relieved that things are moving in the right direction rather than having the same sort of exuberance that dairy farmers have been having over the last year or two
5154129 hopefully well see the exchange rate helping lift prices further thats been the problem in the past that weve certainly seen strong prices and the new zealand dollars eroded all the gains but hopefully the new zealand dollars going to work in the right direction for them for lamb prices youre also interested in whats happening with the pound and euro given that thats where a lot of lamb goes to so those cross rates are important too
5154130 markets are slowing we are progressively reducing finished inventory levels which has resulted in lower production through our factories and impacted our economies of scale in the short term interest costs are also up due to the increased funding requirements during the transitional period of the factory relocations
5154131 i am confident that the results we have experienced from the first phase of the global manufacturing strategy will ensure the forecasted savings will be fully realised
5154132 the lower manufacturing costs are now starting to flow through from the thailand factory these actual and forecasted savings are exceeding initial expectations
5154133 such a show of violence is pushing kashmiri people especially our youth toward revolution
5154134 at this point i think the international community has to step in otherwise we fear a growing extremism this kind of anger comes at the worst time
5154135 pakistan has to put its political house in order before we can say what it means for kashmir
5154136 its beyond the numbers game now mr musharraf would like to go down in history as someone who fought the charges against him and left office with dignity
5154137 vor allem weil das festival v llig ohne ffentliche mittel auskommt
5154138 just kidding well i owe you a new set of frames dont i lets see if we can find a match in stock shall we
5154139 okay so how much is this going to run me
5154140 i broke you sons glasses sir so it wont cost you a cent if we break it we either fix it or replace it and its free
5154141 now is there anything else i can do for you today
5154142 we saw a piece of tire fly into the air and we thought she was killed
5154143 sure salisbury has had a nice run but there are also some really good teams that will be coming this year
5154144 there really is a lot of balance in this league
5154145 nobody is going to run away and hide thats for sure
5154146 theyve got a lot of talent coming back and are always tough to beat
5154147 were still trying to find the best fit at quarterback and right now weve got two guys competing for the job
5154148 i really think this will be one of the best defenses ive seen since ive been here
5154149 i really feel like its time for this team to take that next step i think it could be an exciting year for us
5154150 it will be very tough to replace them but so far the kids have been working hard and were getting things figured out
5154151 weve lost 20 players from last year and weve got a lot of work to do
5154152 a lot of our players this year will be moving up from the jvs and how quickly they can adjust to the varsity game will determine how successful we can be
5154153 i think we can be competitive again and i know these kids are going to work their tails off
5154154 well just go out and play as hard as we can every friday and see what happens
5154155 i think weve got a really good chance to do some things if we keep coming together
5154156 our problem last year is we just couldnt finish we led or were tied at halftime of every game we played except for one and we just couldnt finish overall well have a lot of speed and with the kids having a better grasp of everything now im really excited to see where we can go
5154157 im just going to bring them along a little more slowly but i really think well be able to compete in this league ive faced a lot of these teams before so im not a stranger
5154158 im going to try to find more of a balance
5154159 with our lack of experience and the team still feeling me out and vice versa its just going to be a gradual process
5154160 its kind of unfortunate that well be a one and done because this is a very competitive league
5154161 im very familiar with these teams and coaches from being around and playing them before and i know its going to be very tough
5154162 its a good mix from both schools were just going to be young
5154163 weve got a total of 35 seniors in the senior class so weve got a lot of room to grow
5154164 i hope well be able to compete a little bit
5154165 but in our first year anything positive will be a good first step for us
5154166 you never really know what to expect when you come into a new situation but i think things have gone pretty well
5154167 im learning the defense and im enjoying playing with my teammates and i like the coaches a lot so i cant complain about anything
5154168 theres a little saying the more you can do the better
5154169 so you cant limit yourself to anything you have to keep an open mind and learn as much as possible as quick as possible and then just be ready wherever they need you
5154170 he was a player that we liked a guy that had been productive with his other team and he was our kind of guy
5154171 we thought hed fit well what exactly where he ends up is going to be a little on him but hes done a good job hes a guy were very happy with
5154172 you just go out there and do your work and see what happens thats what im doing and thats the same thing hes doing
5154173 im getting there im getting it down a little more after every practice there are still certain things i need to iron out that i havent quite learned yet but im trying to get those things down and then ill be ready
5154174 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5154175 that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys
5154176 a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5154177 i just dont want to splash the water on him yet you kn ow what i mean
5154178 heres the thing hes had great vision hes made some heads up plays and weve had success i really like all that maybe i want more but i want better technique i want him to use the kind of techniques that are going to take him further down the road remember we were talking differently last week after the buffalo game oh colt came down to earth well now hes in outer space again
5154179 hes having fun but theres a lot more distance that he has to go he shouldnt be strutting his stuff
5154180 i saw him putting ice down his back in the first quarter and im thinking thats kind of funny he was trying to cool himself off it was like midway through the first quarter
5154181 the rhythm was a little off and i think he fought through it he wasnt sure of the first thing he wanted to do and ive got to get him to help himself with his gut feel because he had the right decisions at first and he just wanted it to be better and he didnt need it to be
5154182 he didnt see it didnt focus on it and he turned back in and tried to throw the ball back over the middle to the tight end and it wasnt there
5154183 its put a lot of pressure on us as coaches
5154184 was against the war in iraq from the get go
5154185 we need to believe in the power of american diplomacy and we should not believe a military conflict with iran is inevitable
5154186 our first impulse should be a serious and patient and persistent diplomatic effort too often in our national debate we focus on the military option and give short shrift to the diplomatic option
5154187 hed been heckling me when i went to pick up an award
5154188 when i picked up the award i had to walk past him so i went to say hi and suddenly he had me pinned against the wall
5154189 i just had to leave the building through the back door it was horrible i went home with a heavy heart and an award
5154190 i wanted to pitch in this ballpark it hasnt been that nice to me in return
5154191 when i tried to hit the corners i missed when i came over the plate they hit it hard
5154192 its a lack of command and control and at this point confidence
5154193 it started with the hanging breaking ball to alex on an 0 2 pitch it just dominoed
5154194 i can hear you the rest of the world hears you and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon
5154195 you can double quit rates with a telephone quitline and a free patch
5154196 older smokers are motivated to quit and that quitlines and pharmacotherapy greatly increase the odds of successfully quitting
5154197 what we dont know is how much money this really saves if saving money is your goal
5154198 if you just look at it from a strict budget perspective its not going to save medicare a lot one way or another
5154199 the situation was getting pretty serious and i knew that the weather was getting worse and i was starting to have to really plan ahead for something dramatic mr cole told network ten today
5154200 i just knew that i had to try and survive to help them out
5154201 i tried to make the right decisions and luckily we got out
5154202 there were a couple of moments where i had to lead them up quite a dangerous avalanche slope and i told them to hang on and when i went up i set an avalanche off and i really feared for their lives but we just had to continue on and try
5154203 literally we were digging ourselves in a hole deeper and deeper and getting buried more and more he said
5154204 i just wanted to try and jot down some of my thoughts and what was happening because i didnt know if wed get out of it and i just wanted to write a record down when i was still sane because in such cold conditions your body starts deteriorating quite quickly

5154216 this was one of those games we used to have back in the day we get a quick lead and boom the next thing you know were already down seven or eight runs
5154217 and you get three in the first i just couldnt get one break today i missed over the plate and every time it hurt me
5154218 it goes up and down but we havent been on the upside for a little while now were trying to get some wins it just hasnt been rolling our way
5154219 he settled down and just hit his spots he threw strikes and got us
5154220 this team if you dont locate if you fall behind and make mistakes theyll do it to you in a hurry
5154221 this was not a game you wanted to go through
5154222 especially in this ballpark and being the last game we get to play here it leaves a bitter taste in your mouth i wont have good memories of this ballpark
5154223 ive tried qualifying before for the u s junior and i think i tried qualifying for the u s open before but never made it
5154224 so it was nice to get in and im looking forward to it
5154225 thats why i tried to qualify you have to have the mentality that you can do it and thats what i have
5154226 ive been trying to find out about everything when it comes to no 2
5154227 my short game has to be in good shape because those greens are very hard to play ive tried to read about where to miss the ball on the greens because you have to miss in the right places
5154228 i know i can compete with these guys and ill get the chance to do it i want to go out there and have fun and see how i stack up
5154229 im feeling really good about my game and i know ill have to be at my best
5154230 you get to walk alongside or right down the fairway with competitors
5154231 you get to stand alongside the greens and see which way the ball is breaking you just get a great feel for the golf
5154232 nothings official until the vote and we havent signed anything but we are hopeful
5154233 there is a bunch of logistics and things like that we have to work out
5154234 but mark and i have missed the people and have missed the game so were glad to be getting back in the business
5154235 i think this was the coming out party of the turnaround for this tournament
5154236 we will sit down and talk about things we could have done better and then work on those and keep going
5154237 we watched to see how the ball was coming into the greens and we made sure to put the proper water on the greens each night
5154238 bent greens in august can be tough but we watched them pretty closely
5154239 you know its the way it was meant to be played this is what i like to see
5154240 nowhere in my best dreams i can imagine something like what i did this year
5154241 i know how difficult it is to win these things and especially here because you only have one chance every four years
5154242 it does mean more for me to win it with serena to share this kind of moment with your sister
5154243 the reason probably i won this title is because i have a fantastic time here enjoying a lot in the village that was amazing experience for me always was a pleasure to know new people no
5154244 i have chances in the second set and i didnt take it
5154245 after that rafa was dominating he was make me run a lot hes a great champion because he has been winning every important tournament in the past months
5154246 its unbelievable for me this is the best moment in my career ill never forget it

5154252 f 250 super chief pays tribute to the bold optimism that is part of the american character
5154253 the f 250 super chiefs innovations pave a new path for the american truck its a notion and a modern design so bold it could only come from ford
5154254 the tri flex fuel engine encourages the development of the hydrogen fuel infrastructure for the best future mobility solution
5154255 it also drives the expansion of the domestic ethanol e85 fuel production and availability and of course provides our customers the convenience of gasoline until these other fuels become more readily available
5154256 ford has been the truck leader for so long no one can remember it being any other way
5154257 the f 250 super chief boldly restates our leadership with a quintessentially american truck
5154258 but as premium amenities and finishes become more ordinary we wanted to push the envelope and show our truck customers and our competitors what a truly upscale distinctly american pickup might look like
5154259 while the f 250 super chief is an extreme example of interior indulgence our experience with trucks has shown that customers want more interior comfort and amenities than ever
5154260 the current f 150 demonstrated that as far as we were willing to go on interior comfort and design our customers may be willing to go further
5154261 the ford f 250 super chief concept allows us to better gauge where the high end of rugged elegance just might be

5154270 whether it is bus companies or restaurants employers all over the country are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit locally or nationally the recs monthly report on jobs which is conducted in association with kpmg and ntc research shows that the demand for staff continues to rise this demand covers both skilled and unskilled posts and has led to a number of recruiters undertaking pro active campaigns in the new member states
5154271 whilst these figures show that workers from poland are keen to come to the uk and that in the main they contribute to uk market at the same time more needs to be done to ensure that they are not exploited and do not fall into the wrong hands
5154272 it is unacceptable that people are being contracted to work outside the law this is harmful to both the worker and for bona fide agencies who are competing with the small number of rogue operators the rec is pressing the government to improve its enforcement regime and is promoting best practice within the industry when it comes to managing migrant labour employers need to ensure they choose recruiters based on their quality and reputation not just cost

5154281 the nice thing about is that they are a two or three hour flight from anywhere in europe
5154282 in 1990 you had a lot of enthusiasm and not much experience now you have a lot of enthusiasm and a very entrepreneurial climate

5154295 if i could lose 10lbs i am sure my boobs would shrink some and that would be great
5154296 i am serious i mean even bloody jordan is going down in size
5154297 youll have no problem losing weight if you do the classes and stop eating chocolate and more sex with you on top obviously
5154298 but your boobs had better not bloody shrink because a i like them and b itll cost us another fortune in bras
5154299 do you know someone has put your bra in the bin
5154300 mom come quick your bra has fallen in the trash shouts bee explain it all again to her whilst wondering if she thought the bra had actually fallen off of me into said huge wheely bin

5154306 the fox knows many things but the hedgehog knows one big thing
5154307 the players put on the field what we did with them in training we realised more than the other games in pre season what we need to do
5154308 but well need more quality in the future if we want to win the premier league or champions league well need more than this
5154309 lampard is not brazilian hes english but he touched the ball very well it was his style the same with ballack we have a style its impossible to say to deco foul people thats not his style
5154310 i only give the players the freedom to play and allow them to express their style this is a chelsea performance not a scolari performance
5154311 im happy with anelka i said to him you will have three or four chances you need to make one or two goals for me and for the people i want people to believe in you more than before
5154312 theyll go away for a few days now to the national team thats frustrating but this is a fifa date
5154313 well have six or seven players at training and start building some ideas for the game against wigan well hope the others get back in condition and well be ready
5154314 youre not going to break into the top four no one is this year spurs have got a squad and cant even win at middlesbrough so you start forgetting about them the top four are on another level
5154315 when they play pass and move its very difficult to stay with them ive had good backing terrific backing to bring in crouch and defoe diarra i couldnt have asked for more
5154316 as an immigrant the first thing you want is a job if you have a job you have to have a bank account just to be able to get paid
5154317 economic growth for its own sake is of limited value
5154318 if it is supported by a large intake of immigrants it will increase gnp but not necessarily gnp per head in other words living standards the reason is that everyone who comes to work in ireland needs a home healthcare education providing for these needs costs money with the economy at virtually full employment a more balanced approach is called for
5154319 sooner or later we have to think about this we are not going to solve our problems by importing poles for ever
5154320 scotland has had a big spurt of migration last year and this year this is undoubtedly due to eu enlargement it is not going to go on for ever what the difference in the forecasts from last year and this year show is the critical importance on increasing migration the government has to adopt a policy to make this continue
5154321 if canada has a migration target they just go out and find those migrants the mechanics of this system are in place its a matter of political will and the will is just not there with someone like jack mcconnell
5154322 we still face a demographic challenge that means there are fewer working age people and therefore fewer people to grow the economy and run our public services
5154323 we will reach out to those currently economically inactive and get them back to work

5154326 las variaciones sustanciales son las que se aprobaron en la comisi n del agua subray iglesias en un desayuno con los medios ahora puede haber cosas menores pero estamos hablando de un primer documento de trabajo que tampoco debe tomarse al pie de la letra porque habr ajustes que tenemos que negociar
5154327 de momento los regantes que son los principales usuarios del agua al consumir el 80 lo han recibido bien no he encontrado posiciones frontales destac iglesias al ser preguntado por el borrador del nuevo plan ellos han considerado que es un documento aceptable para empezar a negociar y esa tambi n es nuestra propia posici n

5154338 la mentira el enga o y la manipulaci n son talentos naturales en los psic patas cuando son pillados en alguna mentira o desafiados con la verdad rara vez quedan perplejos o desconcertados cambian simplemente sus historias o procuran remoldar los hechos de modo que parezcan constantes con respecto a la mentira el resultado es una serie de declaraciones contradictorias y un oyente profundamente confundido

5154344 la psicopat a tal como fue concebida originariamente por cleckley 1941 no se limita al hecho de involucrase en actividades ilegales sino que tambi n abarca caracter sticas de la personalidad tales como la manipulaci n la falta de sinceridad el egocentrismo y la falta de sentimiento de culpa caracter sticas que se encuentran claramente presentes en criminales pero tambi n en c nyuges padres jefes abogados pol ticos y directores ejecutivos por nombrar solamente a algunos
5154345 la investigaci n actual buscaba responder a algunas preguntas b sicas sobre la caracter sticas psicol gicas de la psicopat a en contextos no forenses haciendo esto hemos vuelto al nfasis original de cleckey 1941 sobre la psicopat a como un estilo de la personalidad no s lo presente entre los criminales sino tambi n en personas exitosas en la sociedad
5154346 lo que queda claro de nuestros hallazgos es que a la medidas de la psicopat a han convergido en un prototipo de la psicopat a que implica una combinaci n de caracter sticas interpersonales dominantes y fr as b la psicopat a s existe en la comunidad y en una tasa quiz s m s elevada que lo esperado y c la psicopat a parece coincidir poco con los trastornos de la personalidad excepto por los trastornos de la personalidad antisocial
5154347 est claro que en donde mucho m s trabajo se necesita hacer es en entender qu factores diferencian al psic pata constante aunque quiz s no constante moralmente del psic pata que infringe la ley dicha investigaci n necesita sin ninguna duda que se utilicen muchos m s casos no forenses de lo que ha sido habitual en el pasado
5154348 la naturaleza de la pas psicopat a implica que causa m s caos en la sociedad que la mayor a de las otras enfermedades mentales dado que el desorden involucra ante todo reacciones en contra del ambiente social que arrastran a otras personas a su red de destrucci n la desesperaci n y la ansiedad causada por antisociales psic patas afecta tr gicamente a familias y comunidades dejando profundas cicatrices f sicas y emocionales

5154356 i came to nepal five times between 2001 and 2006
5154357 however it was always like a tourist i never had any interest in nepals politics
5154358 everywhere i went people would ask me have you met prachanda
5154359 i stayed in nepal for a month and friends and relatives would call me up asking the same question i realised here was a man who was the centre of all attraction
5154360 when you live underground for 25 years even those very close to you dont know everything about you
5154361 for instance even prachandas wife sita doesnt for instance she says he never worked for the us and yet he worked on a usaid project in bharatpur for some time
5154362 yet it was a herculean task to create it in the subsequent editions i hope to give the skeleton flesh and blood
5154363 when you write a book you want your subject to grow taller
5154364 then the importance of the book also grows now i am happy that prachanda is the new prime minister
5154365 but as an indian whenever i talked to prachanda and other maoists i found them extremely cooperative

5154387 about 40 per cent of the demand comes from the transport sector another 40 per cent from industrial companies and 10 per cent from construction the rest is divided up between it and other sectors
5154388 interest comes almost entirely from companies that cant find people elsewhere because they are in a tight labour market or because they are in remote areas we tend to fill most of the vacancies we advertise

5154423 is unique in the field of developing works for the stage
5154424 it is a key element in its conference mission to encourage creativity and develop diverse voices and new works for the american stage applicants may submit work for consideration through a multi tiered selection process involving multiple readers and a panel of theatre professionals who consider projects based on each writers voice as presented in the script and not on a recognizable name or previous accomplishments this process enables the eugene oneill theater center to continue to seek and develop new voices for the stage selected artists receive a developmental residency at the oneill during the summer of 2009
5154425 this conference belongs to the playwrights and i believe that it is imperative to allow the playwrights who submit their work the opportunity to have their plays read and considered seriously for the conference i remain committed to the open submission process and it is a priority for the playwrights conference to seek out the best writers through this endeavor
5154426 its too early to be overly confident about the economy

5154429 families are barely making it they cant even afford the basics for their kids
5154430 the good news is obviously no state is better prepared or organized to deal with whatever comes this way than the state of florida
5154431 youll be in our thoughts and prayers i am very impressed by what youre doing and what youre prepared to do coming from a state that is not often hit by a hurricane im incredibly impressed
5154432 we have assumed that for the first 72 hours we should rely on no one but ourselves because thats how long it takes for help to come
5154433 weve had a fortunate two years but for all of us who were here the memories of 2004 and 2005 are still fresh
5154434 now is the time for floridians to take the steps necessary to prepare should fays track bring her over our state this week
5154435 we hope that this storm does not turn into a hurricane and if it does that the damage is minimal
5154436 as long as the grotto stands key west will never again experience the full brunt of a hurricane
5154437 people are playing in their head considering what happened the last time
5154438 it is pretty much unsafe to walk around at night
5154439 i wasnt going to lay down and take it the bear came and tried to fight me
5154440 i started punching it in the head kicking it and elbowing it i was boxing him using one arm to defend one arm to strike
5154441 chugach state park is a bear factory it pumps out bears every year
5154442 they are going to be cheek to jowl with us forever
5154443 it is a state park people that use the state park they want to see bears there
5154444 you dont go swimming in shark infested waters and dont expect to be bit
5154445 the sow found her and beat her up pretty good
5154446 most of the people who are attacked in town dont want the bear killed they recognize she is a mom defending her cubs
5154447 we just cant let her live there because she will attack again
5154448 we need to kill some of these bears and we need to kill some of these moose
5154449 i think the pecking order needs to be re established with humans on top
5154450 what other city in the world has pernicious wildlife running around in its city parks
5154451 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5154452 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5154453 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5154454 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5154455 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5154456 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5154457 nazario said that he was asked are they dead yet
5154458 ive put in applications everywhere for everything but nobody wants to hire you if you have been indicted

5154460 there are no bodies no forensic evidence no crime scene and no identities
5154461 the afghans did not go to canada to kill canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghans to please the fascist regime of america

5154463 your son will never be able to focus on anything
5154464 it was about 300 metres away from us flying away from us as we watched it and it struck another aircraft that had been coming across
5154465 it the microlight completely disintegrated in a big bang small pieces started falling down to the ground
5154466 when it first happened it looked like the plane would go straight down but the pilot recovered it and seemed to be in control of it
5154467 a search took place and we did locate two scenes of wreckage one towards coventry and one in brandon wood approximately one mile apart
5154468 as far as i am aware the single engine aircraft disintegrated pretty much in mid air debris is spread over a wide area
5154469 our priority is that we can retrieve the bodies as quickly as possible and that relatives can be notified and can have time and privacy to mourn their loss
5154470 how they collided and how they came to the collision we still do not know
5154471 there are two scenes and they are difficult to get to we are appealing for anyone who witnessed the crash to get in touch
5154472 we will work on accomplishing it within the coming weeks
5154473 such a decision will be followed by some logistical measures which need to be taken by both countries in order to put the agreement into effect
5154474 the ones we know about have committed criminal offenses in syria
5154475 we inquired about other people and we are still waiting for a response from syrian officials
5154476 later the cabinet will issue a separate decree for an embassy in syria
5154477 then all that remains in front of us are procedural steps which the two foreign ministries will be tasked with taking
5154478 the syrians do not need an embassy to operate in lebanon they have their intelligence as well as their allies
5154479 referring the issue of lebanese prisoners in syrian jails to committees is equivalent to killing it we all know that forming committees will not help in resolving the issue
5154480 demarcating borders in the shebaa farms area will help liberate the occupied territory whereas excluding it aims at creating pretexts for hizbullah to hold on to its arms
5154481 we are not saying that to turn our back to discussing a defense strategy for lebanon but to say that there are other important issues which need to be discussed during national dialogue sessions
5154482 we need to address economic and social issues as well as ways to implement the decisions that were taken during earlier dialogue sessions
5154483 the situation was getting pretty serious and i knew that the weather was getting worse and i was starting to have to really plan ahead for something dramatic
5154484 i just knew that i had to try and survive to help them out
5154485 i tried to make the right decisions and luckily we got out
5154486 there were a couple of moments where i had to lead them up quite a dangerous avalanche slope and i told them to hang on and when i went up i set an avalanche off and i really feared for their lives but we just had to continue on and try
5154487 literally we were digging ourselves in a hole deeper and deeper and getting buried more and more
5154488 i just wanted to try and jot down some of my thoughts and what was happening because i didnt know if wed get out of it and i just wanted to write a record down when i was still sane because in such cold conditions your body starts deteriorating quite quickly
5154489 its an ankle injury hell be out for two to three weeks
5154490 its not the result i would have wanted but in the context of the season i cannot be too disappointed
5154491 our attacking play was good in the first half but in the second half we struggled at times
5154492 we lost the balance in the side when ryan giggs and michael carrick went off injured and although we hit the bar and there were one or two scraps in the box we were not too dangerous
5154493 we ended up having to push patrice evra out to the left side of midfield and he is obviously not our best attacking player being a left back
5154494 in the second half we never looked to break them down nothing too dangerous
5154495 newcastle were good on the counter attack and in obafemi martins and damien duff they have players with quality in these positions if you dont stop them they can be dangerous
5154496 we had possession of the ball but didnt make it count at times but in light of the people we had missing it was a creditable result for us
5154497 we deserved the point because our performance was good and our attitude was spot on
5154498 you cant carry anyone here because whatever side man united put out they are a great side
5154499 we won 4 0 but more important the chelsea fans saw a beautiful game we have to keep this going and we can every game every week
5154500 we played more aggressive than last season and portsmouth were surprised with our team this is a chelsea performance but well need more quality in the future
5154501 weve worked on various tactics pre season and the first half was the best football we can play
5154502 having not won anything last year i think weve gone into the season with a new determination
5154503 i think the owner is happy like the other fans
5154504 it was a different experience for me to what ive lived until now i only give the players the freedom to play and allow them to express their style
5154505 lampard is not brazilian hes english but he touched the ball very well the same with michael ballack
5154506 the full backs jose bosingwa and ashley cole are good when they go forward they cross very well dribble very well we played as a team
5154507 how the fans support the team the singing the love of the game fantastic
5154508 i dont want to be sacked but maybe it is one line that chelsea will follow because at chelsea if you dont win it is bad
5154509 i have a contract for two years and i will try and stay two years but its true nobody remembers a loser
5154510 every city has its own kind of stamp every city has its own vibe
5154511 i didnt want to do english programmes because i felt that it would take away your privacy completely
5154512 they said it might be a trade advertisement then it came out and everyone was watching it
5154513 my experience allows me to impart my knowledge to my students

5154558 i thought at times the players were not demanding enough of each other when st kilda were just kicking the ball around
5154559 that results in uncontested marks and an easy path to goals
5154560 as i said to the group after the game look no further than yourself ask yourself what happened and what can be the difference in performance from one week to the next
5154561 the game is not that difficult from a basic thing like manning up when they have got the ball

5154590 everybody was expecting them to win including them and when they called out our names instead it was perfect when we watched the video takes later on we saw them and their producer rolling their eyes and glaring when we won
5154591 people were complaining about us everywhere in the papers and on the radio
5154592 it was very annoying actually because most of the people hadnt even seen our show but they had seen kath amp kim
5154593 we dont like them because were actually from the west and theyre these fancy rich old comedians making fun of lower class people
5154594 weve always been opposed to that sort of comedy and it really got us thinking about the type of show we wanted to make and thats what weve done in the second series its all about lower class people having cool fantasies and action adventures not just being bogans that people laugh at
5154595 she wanted to punish us for beating her favourite kath amp kim
5154596 thats why it took us so long to come back with a second series she never said as much to our face but it wasnt until she left and the new dude came that we were allowed to make another series
5154597 its been suggested and we are now talking about that in some way i dont know what it will be but we are having a bit of a think about it

5154624 it isnt funny anymore the dumbest generation cares little for history books civic principles foreign affairs comparative religions and serious media and art and it knows less careening through their formative years they dont catch the knowledge bug and tradition might as well be a foreign word other things monopolize their attention the allure of screens peer absorption career goals they are latter day rip van winkles sleeping through the movements of culture and events of history preferring the company of peers to great books and powerful ideas and momentous happenings from their ranks will emerge few minds knowledgeable and interested enough to study explain and dispute the place and meaning of our nation adolescence is always going to be more or less anti intellectual of course and learning has ever struggled against immaturity but the battle has never proven so uphill youth culture and youth society fabulously autonomized by digital technology swamp the intellectual pockets holding on against waves of pop culture and teen mores among the millennials intellectual life cant compete with social life and if social life has no intellectual content traditions wither and die books cant hold their own with screen images and without help high art always loses to low amusements maturity comes in part through vertical modeling relations with older people such as teachers employers ministers aunts and uncles and older siblings along with parents who impart adult outlooks and interests in their example they reveal the minor meaning of adolescent worries showing that the authentic stakes of life surpass the feats and letdowns of high school and college the web along with cellphones teen sitcoms and pop music though encourages more horizontal modeling more raillery and minicry of people the same age and intensification of peer consciousness

5154630 we can see little flashpoints in gas prices or a spike in joblessness but getting the whole picture is extremely difficult in part because were depending on government collected data which could often be three months later

5154638 the whole point of the new policy is to make it far less likely that congress will have to engineer a bailout
5154639 they need to create an older age bracket in this tournament soon so that next year i can compete in it again im going to be too old
5154640 i thought wouldnt it be fun to do this in wilson so we talked to the people at henshaw hoops and made arrangements with them and weve been doing it ever since
5154641 weve had a tremendous amount of support from not just individuals over the years but families as well complimentary boat rides were available throughout the day and all the kids received tote bags donated by jim and mariana bull
5154642 were extremely proud of our community and the tournament is another opportunity to show it off
5154643 its satisfying when we go out of town to other 3 on 3 tournaments throughout western new york and we see kids wearing a harbor hoops shirt or using a harbor hoops tote bag or when we run into someone whos been to the tournament either a player or a parent its very satisfying to know youve had a positive impact on so many people thats why well keep doing this as long as the interest is there
5154644 as a kid growing up i was addicted to basketball as an adult i know how powerful tournaments like these can be in reaching young kids in a positive way
5154645 i have a large family of my own today and basketball is a huge part of it
5154646 there are a number of things involved the sportsmanship of the teams the camaraderie of the kids on the teams showing them how to compete in a fun atmosphere
5154647 one of my favorite people of all time is ms ellen degeneres
5154648 so i wish all the best all the happiness all the joy that comes with that certificate just the joy of being able to stand up and say that in front of everyone you love and care about in front of each other and to walk away legal is huge
5154649 i love ellen degeneres i watch her show all the time
5154650 i just want to say congratulations and i am really sorry you didnt invite me to your wedding
5154651 i dont think weve ever been the champs of a basketball summer league so hopefully this helps the guys gain some confidence heading into the season
5154652 hopefully weve learned that for us to be able to beat a quality opponent like wilson weve got to pass cut and set screens play more as a team
5154653 we didnt do a very good job of that at times this summer but we finally did it at the end of the game and we were more successful

5154655 show me just what mohammed brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached
5154656 you cannot run two systems of law alongside each other
5154657 but the suggestion that a british court should treat people differently according to their faith whether thats being jewish or christian or muslim is absolutely divisive and i think really rather dangerous
5154658 im absolutely clear in my mind that what is right for britain is that we are all subject to the same law criminal and civil and that we are whatever our differences are treated equally before that law
5154659 i do believe that under the present legal system so far as arbitration is concerned there is nothing preventing muslims today resolving their civil disputes by consent under sharia law

5154670 ken is a doctor of psychology who is known nationally for his work in childhood ptsd kevin is an engineer for northrop grumman and kristian is a local high school mathematics teacher i would have responded exactly as you did had they been treated unfairly in any way
5154671 i told him i wanted to finish the second half of his career together
5154672 it was great knowing that i was going to get a chance to work with him and get him back into the ring
5154673 it was a great opportunity that i couldnt pass up

5154698 mike is opening a lot of doors with what hes doing
5154699 i just want to lay in my own bed for five minutes at least and just relax

5154709 a report has reached me that one muslim sister was attacked in a roman city

5154711 i will issue an edict to the islamic ummah declaring that britain is attacking and insulting our prophet

5154713 judge between them by that which allah has revealed and follow not their desires and beware of them lest they seduce you from some part of that which allah has revealed to you
5154714 but no by your lord they can have no real faith until they make you judge in all disputes between them and find in their souls no resistance against your decisions but accept them with the fullest submission
5154715 i heard the messenger of allah saw say whoever withdraws his hand from obedience to the ameer will find no proof for himself when he meets allah on the day of judgment and whoever dies without having an oath of allegiance bayah on his neck he would die the death of jahiliyyah
5154716 the prophets ruled over the children of israel whenever a prophet died another prophet succeeded him but there will be no prophet after me there will soon be khulafaa and they will number many
5154717 fulfill the bayah to them one after the other and give them their dues for allah will verily account them about what he entrusted them with
5154718 if the pledge of allegiance bayah has been taken for two khulafaa kill the latter of them
5154719 if five agreed and accepted one man while one man rejected then hit his head with the sword
5154720 the collection of the zakah the implementation of the hudood the distribution of the spoils and the appointment of the jumu ah are for the sultan

5154735 we try to do as much as we can internally and minimize our outsourcing
5154736 a lot of the time its from a cost perspective we feel that its more cost effective to do it internally
5154737 most outsourcing is driven by owned by or managed by a consultant and generally consultants are looking for other areas to increase their footprint within a company
5154738 those types of consultants can add costs not take them away

5154782 for the last three or four summers weve been going over to europe and doing all the festivals and it looks like we just totally ignored our fans in america but thats not the case as a consequence the american fans miss us and they want their metallica so this will be a good homecoming for them and us

5154788 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
5154789 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
5154790 therefore we do not lose heart though outwardly we are wasting away yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day for our light and momentary troubles are achievining for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all so we fix our eyes not on what is seen but on what is unseen for what is seen is temporary but what is unseen is eternal
5154791 has it come to this has the magical impact of george lucas original vision of star wars been reduced to the level of saturday morning animation
5154792 its a deadening film that cuts corners on its animation and slumbers through a plot that a makes us feel like weve seen it all before and b makes us wish we hadnt
5154793 we saw this in a theater full of kids and there wasnt a single moment that caused spontaneous cheering
5154794 ziro the hutt is perhaps the most bizarre character ever created in the series history yes including jar jar a jabba shaped slug who wears face paint and feathers the creature speaks english rather than huttese except that he she somehow has the accent of truman capote by way of eric cartman of south park
5154795 i found it impossible to concentrate on much of anything she he was saying except to imagine that all of this would one day make for a great book entitled in cold hutt naturally
5154796 the character was so bad so incredibly awful that it was a slap to the face it is many times worse than im actually describing this character was actually too much for me
5154797 after meeting ahsoka we really understand why he killed all the younglings id have done it with my bare hands she calls him skyguy which is amazingly annoying and he calls her snips
5154798 of course the anakin ahsoka relationship is made impossibly awkward by the fact that shes half naked and 12 and that theyre always in close quarters i dont need the force to see this fan fiction coming
5154799 by golly i feel really lucky to be alert enough to know that when a dotted red line shows up under a word i just typed and i did not put it there intentionally and i dont know how to put it there intentionally it means that i spelled that word wrong
5154800 t here are over 5000 fishes and other exhibits which are presented in more than 117 specially designed tanks that are arranged along a zoom long passageway
5154801 its a huge experience to see this great underwater world in langkawi youl get to see a large collection of fish and other incredible animal at this place going to langkawi then this is a must rg flying e dk
5154802 just got back from auckland and visited their kelly tarlton s uw the place is well maintained but in terms of exhibits the langkawi one far surpasses it with more varieties of fish with the exception of sharks with a bit of touching up maybe ours could be the best in the region
5154803 i think this is one of the best underwaterworld in malaysia i ever visited so many fish in many huge tanks a good place to know about species of fish and many other creature
5154804 we visited it twice the children enjoyed it so much
5154805 for those who cannot swim diving or snorkeling it is highly recommended for them to take their children to visit this langkawi underwater world we can find about 5 000 varieties of fish and other amazing underwater creatures apart from that we can also go to the fossil library where we can find unlimited information on underwater kingdom hurry hurry take you children there our childrens are going to enjoy most
5154806 you may find this place boring fishes are not as many as you would
5154807 whoever comes to you while your affair has been united over one man intending to divide your power or dissolve your unity kill him
5154808 if the oath of allegiance bayah has been taken for two khulafaa kill the latter of them
5154809 the children of israel have been governed by prophets whenever a prophet died another prophet succeeded him but there will be no prophet after me there will soon be khulafaa and they will number many they asked what then do you order us he saw said fulfill allegiance to them one after the other and give them their dues for verily allah will ask them about what he entrusted them with
5154810 i heard the messenger of allah saw say whoever withdraws his hand from obedience to the ameer will find no proof for himself when he meets allah on the day of judgment and whoever dies without having an oath of allegiance bayah on his neck he would die the death of jahiliyyah

5154812 we try to keep our standards really high so no one shows up selling synthetic turquoise and so buyers know someone is keeping an eye on quality
5154813 we want the artists to get the most they can for objects and collectors want to know theyre getting a genuine article
5154814 he didnt look good to me and i knew this could be it
5154815 i said hey bernard how are you and i kissed his forehead
5154816 he shrugged his shoulders like im tired and i said i know youre tired later on that night it took a turn for the worse
5154817 the doctor came in and i said hes gone isnt he
5154818 he said you never seen a black man as pretty as me
5154819 i said what do you have for me and he kissed me that was our first kiss
5154820 i am allahs slave and his messenger i shall not go against his commandment and he will not make me the loser
5154821 it is the messenger of allahs bed and you are a filthy polytheist so i do not want you to sit on it
5154822 by allah since you left me you have turned bad
5154823 should i intercede for you with the messenger of allah by allah if i had only an ant i would fight you with it
5154824 his weapons are being used to kill our kids so he cannot be an honest mediator

5154836 o david we did indeed make thee a vicegerent on earth so judge thou between men in truth and justice nor follow thou the lusts of thy heart for they will mislead thee from the path of god
5154837 they are those who if we establish in the land establish regular prayer and give regular charity enjoin the right and forbid wrong with god rests the end and decisions of all affairs
5154838 god has promised to those among you who believe and work righteous deeds that he will of a surety grant them in the land inheritance of power as he granted it to those before them that he will establish in authority their religion the one which he has chosen for them and that he will change their state after the fear in which they lived to one of security and peace

5154840 o people of quraysh by allah even if you enter a hole the arabs following your traces will also enter the same therefore be mindful of allah in their affairs
5154841 certainly the arabs will not submit to anyone except this tribe of quraysh
5154842 the main issue is the fascist book of the koran
5154843 i have respect for the fact that danish newspapers have now all printed the muhammad caricatures on the basis that we will not let ourselves be divided
5154844 the imam is a shield from behind which the muslims fight and defend themselves
5154845 when you all muslims are united as one block under a single khalifah a chief muslim ruler and a man comes up to disintegrate you and separate you into different groups then kill that man
5154846 if the muslim world gave the baia pledge to two khalifah chief muslim rulers the first one who was given the baia pledge first will remain as the khalifah then kill the latter the second one
5154847 it is forbidden for muslims to have two amirs for this would cause differences in their affairs and concepts their unity would be divided and disputes would break out amongst them the sunnah would then be abandoned the bidaa innovations would spread and fitna would grow and that is in no ones interest
5154848 a mumin believer cannot be bitten from the same hole twice
5154849 i will not let you go to your tribe and boast amongst them that you fooled muhammad salallahu alaihi wasallam twice
5154850 a believer never gets bitten from the same hole twice
5154851 muhammad salallahu alaihi wasallam sentenced abu azza to be killed reference nahagul islam by ibrahim al kattan and ali hasan aude jordan 1966
5154852 this is a warning against apathy and an indication that intelligence must be implemented ab ubayd has said it is not possible for the true believer to be afflicted from something only for him her to return to it
5154853 and the context of this narration is well known that the prophet had captured the poet abu ghurrah at the day of the battle of badr so the prophet gave him amnesty and freed him based on the condition that he would not continue on his hostility and derision he then caught up with his people and returned to belligerence towards the muslims and derision against them then he was captured on the day of the battle of uhud and was asked about the amnesty that was given to him upon this the prophet said the believer is not stung from the same hole twice from this it is understood that if one were to suffer injury from a particular element then they should abstain from it lest they should suffer such again
5154854 i will issue an edict to the islamic ummah declaring that britain is attacking and insulting our prophet

5154863 in the second half of 2007 58 percent of all vulnerabilities affected web applications figure 10 this is less than the 61 percent in the first half of 2007 this drop in the proportion of web application vulnerabilities is a continuing trend in the previous volume of the symantec internet security threat report the potential impact of site specific vulnerability findings was discussed as a possible cause for this trend from an attackers standpoint rather than try to compromise numberous sites it is better to compromise a specific popular site with a single vulnerability as this increases the chances of compromising a larger number of hosts

5154870 wait until the summer months because when it heats up so will stewart
5154871 the koran is currently the worlds most ideological influential text

5154877 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5154878 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5154879 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5154880 the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
5154881 i think they may not appreciate the magnitude of those consequences yet the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5154882 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5154883 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5154884 you know you could buy extra now and share with those in need

5154890 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5154891 we have safely placed senator mccain in a cone of silence

5154901 if we keep getting protection like that we can do whatever we want weve passed the ball well the last two years and knew we were going to be able to throw the football but weve got to keep working on the running game to help our defense
5154902 our quarterback was touched a little bit more than were used to
5154903 we were a little bit out of sync in the passing game early
5154904 it is clear in part from evidence that you all have published that lead managers gave the market a false sense of liquidity when real investor demand was disappearing
5154905 ubs acted against investors best interests in part by buying ars in auctions that otherwise would have failed without disclosing that fact to the market or to its customers if the allegations in attorney general cuomos complaint are true and if lead managers other than ubs engaged in similar activity the violations at the heart of the ars market downturn stem not from problems with distributing firms at the point of sale but in the relatively opaque auction process
5154906 and thats why im treating this as a sales practice issue
5154907 when this is done it will be the largest civil recovery case in history
5154908 firms like merrill lynch citigroup and wachovia can buy and hold large volumes of ars because even though their ars positions would be significant they are still small relative to the firms total assets and those firms have sufficient financial resources to carry large securities positions

5154916 due to frequent tides we can beach the ship just two hundred yards metres from the coast
5154917 it saves us thousands of dollars for every ship we break whereas in alang and china they beach ships two or three kilometres out into the sea
5154918 were handling ships as big as 80 000 tonnes these days
5154919 the rods made from scrap ships are inferior to those made by top steel producers but theyre at least 20 percent cheaper than high grade steel and therefore are overwhelmingly used in the countrys construction industry
5154920 back then we were paying 430 dollars a tonne about three months ago it was about 940 dollars a tonne but in may india introduced a 15 percent export tax and the price is now around 1 150 to 1 200 dollars
5154921 in the global context of rising costs every penny counts right now
5154922 its a very hazardous job our question is is the amount of steel supplied really enough compensation for the damage the industry is doing to workers and the
5154923 the ships are being recycled so we are helping the environment
5154924 we dont dump anything into the sea because everything is worth money so we sell it even the old oil

5154928 we will be presenting the list as part of a resolution and charge sheet in the joint houses and god willing that should happen this week

5154938 its about saving our youth a lot of our youth dont understand their value they just accept the lies that the enemy has told them about their worth about what they can accomplish and about what they should settle for

5154943 the ionsound residency will be great for our undergraduate and graduate composers because our students will be able to work with this ensemble on an ongoing basis
5154944 the group is open to new music of all styles and will help the students develop their craft through rehearsing and performing their compositions
5154945 because we are a liberal arts department not a conservatory we lack the performance resources of those institutions
5154946 instead we bring professional ensembles to perform on our music on the edge new music series and then invite them to stay to work with our graduate composers
5154947 working with professional musicians and a distinguished composition faculty is the best way to learn the art of composition now pitt will have both
5154948 tropical storm fay poses some risks to the oil and gas production in the gulf said victor shum of energy consultancy purvin and gertz in singapore
5154949 so the storm has lent some support to pricing he said
5154950 we expect a strong first first half 2008 09 having already had a good start to 2009 mainly driven by continued strong global steel demand and prices he said
5154951 realised prices in the first quarter will be slightly higher than last quarter
5154952 the pricing environment in the global steel market is offsetting those cost increases mr omalley said
5154953 as we move from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 our raw material costs specifically coal and iron ore will go by about up 1 2 billion
5154954 our total raw materials cost taking scrap and alloys into account will increase by about 1 6 billion
5154955 cost escalations are a challenge not just in australia but globally
5154956 well continue to work on cost reductions but productivity improvements are an important part of our business as well
5154957 in the next five years theres no reason why demand cant stay strong due to bric brazil russia india china economies he said
5154958 in china there may well be some slower growth but demand for steel continues to very strong
5154959 and weve still got russia and india going flat out
5154960 we see the supply and demand dynamic remaining quite tight

5154969 the ship would be pushed by the spatial bubble and the bubble would be travelling faster than the speed of light
5154970 the problem with this and previous schemes including my own is that part of the exotic matter would have to travel faster than the local speed of light roughly speaking it would need to go faster than the speed of light with respect to the portion of space it occupies and thats not allowed by any established physical theory

5154973 its time we brought it back out into the light
5154974 end of the trail where smelly black and white mustids lived
5154975 obviously i am not exercising and i am eating too much and not the right things so its not that i dont know why its just depressing because i know i wont be doing anything about it for awhile with three kids and trying to work part time i am just tired and hungry and dont have the mental capacity to try to do either exercise or eat better
5154976 i really will have to lose this weight before i go back to work though
5154977 i am also super bothered by the hot celebrity mom thing i mean hello you have the kid barely gain any weight and then hire nannies personal trainers chefs etc to take care of you and the baby and they look awesome in like 4 weeks it makes me want to puke considering i work full time my dh works full time we both try to work out and i still have 7 pounds of pregnancy weight to lose and 15 pounds total i guess i would be skinny too if i had 4 hours a day to work out and someone cooking my meals
5154978 it seems like stories about how fast celebs lose their baby weight are all over the place these days and i do find it annoying i mean if i had a personal trainer 24 7 nanny and personal chef i could probably do it too but then i wouldnt have the life i love and would give up privacy etc
5154979 i think expecting moms to be in tip top shape weeks after having a baby is absolutely ridiculous seriously now if i had 24 hour baby care a personal chef who planned and prepared deliciously healthy meals for me as well as a personal trainer every single day not to mention a personal assistant or two then maybe it would be possible but even if i had all of those things is it really even physically healthy to do that much exercise and or dieting right after having a baby
5154980 if i had a personal trainer millions of dollars a chef and a nanny id have a flat stomach too but in the real world it takes a lot more than what they make it look like its so irritating ive heard of some celebrities getting tummy tucks during their c sections i wonder if thats real but still i wish i was a celebrity so i could be a size 0 five days after giving birth
5154981 it does not bother me at all if i were a celebrity or just rich i could hire the people to make me look like that too it bothers me a lot more to see my friends and other moms i know in real life drop all their baby weight in a few months they are real women just like i am and they look great and fit while i am struggling to lose weight
5154982 i know that all of these celebrity women get right back on the treadmill and do the pilates for hours a day to get back into shape but how do they come away without the stretch marks and the flapjack boobs some women have great skin but do all celebs there are just so few celebs who look to have the typical post pregnancy bodies
5154983 what i really want is for people magazine to report whether they pee when they sneeze if that still happens to celebs then i would feel a little better
5154984 im buying batteries bottled water candles anything we can get right now before it really really gets too bad
5154985 trying to buy supplies because they said there is going to be a storm coming up and we flood like crazy
5154986 t hen it happens and its too late and you go to the store and its already sold out
5154987 my mom taught me very well she taught me to do that prepare for stuff like this because ive been through many of them
5154988 do either of you want to be a pawn memphis do you want to be a pawn
5154989 pig ears silence crickets crickets hop slop and slop drowns pig ears
5154990 how would you like to be a pawn this week memphis
5154991 it is the madness of folly to expect mercy from those who have refused to do justice and even mercy where conquest is the object is only a trick of war the cunning of the fox is as murderous as the violence of the wolf
5154992 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
5154993 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
5154994 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
5154995 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5154996 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5154997 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5154998 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5154999 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars

5155004 i knew and i know he went into the immediate presence of the lord i never doubted that what hurts is i miss him
5155005 how can i be mad at a god who holds my son safely in his arms tonight
5155006 i am preaching so soon after the accident as a tribute to christopher
5155007 i havent lost my son because i know where he is and ill join him one day
5155008 hes not dead when you are a believer in christ you will never die
5155009 he was artistic director of harvest and oversaw the design of the stage the event program and the harvest crusades bumper stickers
5155010 the band will travel by rv and trade in the comforts of three star hotels for the simple pleasure of a campfire shared with friends
5155011 thats jesus in the homeless faces with the junkies in their livin hell thats jesus with the drunks and in the lonely places the rest homes and prison cells thats where jesus is where we ought to be heres where jesus works inside you and me with the folks with aids and the suffering kids thats where jesus hangs thats where jesus is
5155012 on the corner round the prostitutes is where hell probably show he gets invited to church sometimes and sometimes he dont go dont care nuthin about your status what you can or you cant afford dont care if youre voted best actor not impressed with your big award hes not in the five star restaurant eating a six course meal hes not over on some golf course discussing the oil deal
5155013 he wants our voice thats where jesus is thats how he talks thats where jesus is thats how he walks thats where jesus is and he wants our faith thats where jesus is but theres never enough he wants our hearts thats where jesus is thats how he loves
5155014 a revolutionary idea in the presentation of intelligent adult alternative music
5155015 what sort of band would have a name like that
5155016 an expression a microcosm of people part of what we share together is our humanity our common beliefs and the transparency of the whole person that s where our strength lies in terms of our identification with the audience they dont see us as high and mighty but as people like them who can express those feelings in a song
5155017 for free drinks and a dream i gave them my wallet i rolled the dice and upped my price a soul for sale they bought it now a million lights gleam theyre twinkling bove this dead broke alcoholic and i lost everything to free drinks and a dream
5155018 now im so alone i cant go home how could a family understand that your love for them can do you in make you a desperate man though youth is gone the heart still draws you on to devise foolhardy plans you set aside your guilt for kingdoms built on shifting desert sands
5155019 ive been a drunkard most of my life my drinking killed my darling wife but not one night has she left me alone still its not her ghost i dread when she stands next to my bed its those words she speaks that chill me to the bone
5155020 i have seen the wall of heaven and your names not written there and each time you turn from jesus its more than i can bear for there awaits a robe of diamonds and a crown for you to wear but ive see this wall of heaven and your names not written there
5155021 oh fly on you mixed up swallows this is not the stop god has planned you are over san juans crippled sister and its best you do not land
5155022 i just projected myself as this person who lives in capistrano beach and theyll never get out of this town you would think of capistrano and beach as being something interesting but its not this person in the song is shackled by his outward circumstances and his inner spiritual circumstances
5155023 ol jesus who got busted but his restaurants still open they got a rat or two in there and a fine chili relleno with all the stiff competition leos liquor is closin poor leo went down drinkin whisky and drano
5155024 it has a lurid image when youre writing a story song you do want to make something a little shocking that keeps the listener riveted to that story its a fairly popular song it has a memorable melody and theres a certain melancholy to it its a way for people to get in touch with the melancholy in their life it has a universal spiritual outlook that the listener identifies with the implication is that really living life is not about life being greener on the other side but being at peace wherever you are you are who you are wherever you are
5155025 its a great relationship i have had with the fans we share common passion we share common flaws in our character its a real compliment that the art is really an extension of our life this person is really me in a sense
5155026 alive one day and gone the next it wasnt like he had been ill it was like some sort of dream that i kept waiting to awake up from we were all walking around in a fog of shock then you weep and you carry that burden around the song three legged dog from the real men cry album was in remembrance to losing someone it is constantly there and there is not a day that goes by when i dont think about gene and what he means to me sometimes memories crash in to me i was overwhelmed by the unreality of not having gene around
5155027 it was very surreal not something i expected to happen it made life more serious it helped me spiritually to refocus my life in other directions from where it may have been heading a good question but not easy to answer
5155028 she has been very supportive and sacrificial she knew going in gods vision in my life and has always been extremely supportive she has always been a foundational in my ability to do what i do if she wasnt behind it i would go tomorrow and start flipping burgers i have her full blessing and that means a lot to me
5155029 what you hear in the songs i write is an indication of my character it ranges from gentleness to being a little bit harsh in some times
5155030 you cant be married 35 years and not have a sense of humor its very helpful to us as we are growing older of course our faith is the greatest thing we possess i try and be loving and merciful home is a place where my kids can see all of my foibles and failures all the time we are a very forgiving and loving and tolerant family i hope that is what someone would see
5155031 hes a lot of fun we all get along great i think its like any thing we just kind of find out what the land mines are and you dont step on them its not like a lot of bands where theres lot of conflict
5155032 i was hungry and desperate and thought it sounded interesting i had trepidation about working with terry but it ended up turning into this really cool thing we were really surprised about how cool it turned out to be
5155033 its really good being able to play with some different guys and do some music thats not the normal thing you would do weve stepped into this americana thing that we were doing before it was trendy what we are doing now doesnt seem as unusual as the time we began doing it
5155034 meeting up with all the fans and making a lot of music lost dogs is a lot of camaraderie were kinda like old fishing buddies best friends
5155035 musically well strip down the songs to their most basic presentations and get really into the soul of ths songs spiritually my goals are multi tiered its not like a plumber who just plumbs we are doing this tour for a variety of reasons that include the need for money but our overarching spiritual goal to expose our hearts and to give people a chance to reflect on the way that god interacts with us unfortunately because of my being old and wretched i tend to focus on the money first
5155036 i miss her a lot when im traveling we have broken the tour up into three sections so i am not away from her for too long we dont like being apart because were very close and i think she likes my music i find her listening to it a lot more than she used to
5155037 i hope we write better songs so we can keep doing it i want to be able to do this music til we drop
5155038 we have worked a lot in the christian music scene i would like to get it more exposed in the general market field and find it more people it was originally a lark but now its fairly serious business
5155039 im coming as the president of a friend and im coming as a sportsman
5155040 it does not matter that the church that mr bush attended is government sponsored
5155041 the church knows what is happening in china with christianity and the chinese government what matters is that president bush is saying not only to the chinese government but also to the world that christianity matters
5155042 this is what is important this is what the chinese leadership needs to hear
5155043 the church is the power behind america the church was the power behind the british empire before it turned away and failed the church was the power behind the spanish empire until it turned away and failed the church was the power behind rome until it turned away and failed
5155044 however there is still another unavoidable step that these nations must take
5155045 it is to truly love and trust their people and give them greater individual and economic freedom
5155046 they have to come to the unavoidable realization that you cannot have free markets without free enterprise and you cannot have free enterprise without individual freedom
5155047 the stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner
5155048 it a hard and bitter pill to swallow but you cannot think like a socialist or a communism and expect to truly understand and exploit the power of free markets because the two concepts are diametrically opposed to one another
5155049 this is why the apostle paul said when explaining the need to be born again that
5155050 jesus christ is that spirit and where his spirit is there is liberty
5155051 personally i see the hand of god at work in the world moving these nations into position where they will have no choice but to recognize the importance of individual freedom or fail because there is no other way
5155052 as christians and members of the free world who understand this if we care about peace and finding solutions to the problems of hunger and disease if we care about maintaining our current level of prosperity we need to realize that there is a massive global need to educate people and particularly world leaders to the importance of christianity to the world economy
5155053 we need to realize that during the past 100 years during which the idea of socialism and communism prospered in the world great damage was done to the worlds understanding of jesus christ
5155054 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom

5155057 a soul is the first lie sold to humanity by the church believing to have a soul is for dumb people who buy the idea that after life you will be blessed with punishment or a heavenly reward
5155058 all i have is a bloody heart and a scattered brain but you can have my money too
5155059 anna there are three things in this world that dont exist
5155060 people have actually missed the point that advertising because its actively trying to play us is actually probably the smartest industry of them all
5155061 no one has ever really wrestled advertising to the ground and it is the sort of thing that sort of permeates every minute of our waking lives
5155062 we knew dentons approach would be irreverent and also steeped in the desire to want to know more it wasnt going to be a flip show it was going to be rigorous
5155063 that split second when the malls intentionally confusing layout makes our eyes glaze and our jaws slacken the moment when we forget what we came for and become impulse buyers
5155064 i found myself in the supermarket and i went to buy the cheaper dishwashing liquid and found my hand moving over to the more expensive because the advertising told me thats the one to get as i wrote in the pitch document if you can be persuaded to buy the orange dishwashing liquid when the green one is cheaper what else can you be persuaded to do how do you even know your thoughts are your own
5155065 are surrounded by advertising but dont think about it that much and this show helps people think in a way thats funny and interesting
5155066 it would suit an edgy public broadcaster or a risk taking private broadcaster
5155067 the decline in print has been so pervasive that its taking the online stuff with it
5155068 were in a transition period as an industry and were going to see some down quarters as papers deal with that
5155069 the ones who have done well are the ones who have most aggressively diversified
5155070 this is significant because its establishing a separate independent business from our print product
5155071 what this study actually proves is that search moves the branding needle for cpg
5155072 its really good news for brand marketers because there are really strong efficiencies they can find in search marketing the price for this branding value is zero because its being served anyway and marketers pay for clicks not number of impressions at this point the cost per click in these categories is very low
5155073 the implication is if youre present your awareness goes up and if youre not present your awareness goes down
5155074 it seems like from the results that the punishment for a challenger brand is very high for not being in the paid listings so they really should be there
5155075 and its also cost effective for them its probably cheaper than a tv campaign and its much easier to raise the brand perception
5155076 i think our brands have such a strong presence that its nice to be in the first position but i dont think we have to be there
5155077 im not convinced its worth paying the extra money or the extra effort to get there yet
5155078 its kind of like the klondike before the gold rush
5155079 if all branding clients go and do search for branding it will change
5155080 yes its growing and we have helped drive a lot of growth
5155081 werid but i dont want to cost any problems i keep my anger inside and that makes me sad
5155082 were tired of being a foreign car in our own country
5155083 when he first came to me he said i have no idea what im doing
5155084 ok this girl just stole your grandmas purse and shoved her in front of a moving car
5155085 this is the form of pr for the 21st century ceo to be media savvy
5155086 were both 4 foot 11 shes asian and beautiful i love your tattoos and your hard impression and i would love to date you tila
5155087 ok people always tell me i look like umm that girl from that one movie
5155088 come on why did you volunteer if you cant even think of the name come prepared
5155089 i would go to somebody that was in our school before i go to somebody else
5155090 it would certainly pull the curtain back behind the wizard but i wouldnt mind it having an impact on the genre its getting tired
5155091 reality tv stars basically whore themselves out to the very core for the media youd have to be a very strong person to come out with some vestige of integrity it can make you into an idiot reality tv is the decay of civilization

5155093 rookie rb chris johnson 8 carries for 46 yards is electric with the ball providing the offense a burst of energy whenever he touches it
5155094 while third screen media has already been bought and enpocket has already been bought the question isnt which ones will be bought but which ones wont be bought
5155095 today we see a lot of little startups that specialize in mobile
5155096 a lot of the mature advertising networks on the desktop internet what if these guys decide to get into this business too wouldnt they crush the little guys we dont know so far its a very tough environment to be in and its so early
5155097 strategically online networks feel the need to be involved in mobile
5155098 google already offers local spot tv spot radio spot newspaper ads it would be a natural extension for them to offer mobile if that becomes a viable delivery channel
5155099 some of the ad networks are going to rise to the top and some are not going to be successful the ones that know how to work with publishers deliver campaigns are the ones that are going to really shine
5155100 consequently our definition of mobile advertising and marketing is quite different than one off impressions and landing pages that mobile ad networks offer today
5155101 wap banner ads dont generally offer that much more specialized a product in terms of feature and functionality than traditional online networks
5155102 in fact they often offer less information than traditional ad networks given the limitations of wap and the capabilities there what they do offer is some specialized targeting and demographic information that is harder to get from online networks so they fit a niche
5155103 they mobile ad networks have been the most aggressive in canvassing the market providing the education and trying to make the buying and managing mobile manageable
5155104 this is important if you are trying to drive the user to a site or application that will only work on a specific phone or with a certain carrier if we wanted to drive consumers to a mobile site that had video we would target accordingly and avoid bad consumer experiences
5155105 by targeting only smart phones layered within content buckets that our target is more likely to be reading we have seen some great interactions from the clicks that have come from the buys
5155106 mobile is a distinct channel and needs to be treated as such
5155107 we believe we have solutions that cut across many platforms at once rather than platform by platform basis
5155108 when people go to watch video they really have to focus on a certain part of the screen and by having these ads in the area you know where people are looking
5155109 dar ascolto a quello che stia per dire dentro di me il signore

5155139 povero io sono e tribolato fin dagli anni della mia giovinezza
5155140 cosa buona per me che tu mi abbia umiliato per farmi conoscere la tua giustizia
5155141 secondo la veduta degli occhi materiali che io non mi pronunzi secondo quel che si sente dire
5155142 i patimenti di questo mondo non sono nulla in confronto alla futura gloria che si riveler in noi
5155143 lasciami un poco lascia che io pianga tutto il mio dolore prima di andare nel luogo della tenebra coperto dalla caligine della morte

5155149 tu sei giusto o signore e retto il tuo giudizio
5155150 veri sono i giudizi di dio santi in se stessi
5155151 io non sono un dio di discordia ma di pace

5155201 after a while you establish a pattern of problems and issue an enforcement action

5155230 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5155231 im a democratic governor and i fully agree with john mccains paris hilton ad obama just gives big speeches in big stadiums and cant relate to common folk
5155232 i would really like to see him do things in tennessee that would help in other working class and blue collar places like ohio

5155243 when you have certain names in a comic strip that automatically dates the strip
5155244 in calvin and hobbes and peanuts you have little kids
5155245 a lot of times people try to create something people will like
5155246 i hang out with stray cats other peoples dogs not to mention the rats on the subway
5155247 i think were all hoping comics will be a part of that
5155248 we will have 126 buses running routes on the first day of school
5155249 we have been able to eliminate 26 buses but that will probably change after the first week or two we will know how many kids will not be driving to school on their own because of gas prices
5155250 we try to time these routes out but there are a lot of factors we cannot control especially during the first two weeks of the school year

5155260 what we do harkens back to a golden age when newsrooms were full of people who would knock on doors and not take no for an answer
5155261 a lot of organizations cant afford to do it or seem to have lost their appetite for it
5155262 we put what i call a ghost team on this which is designed to observe and not be seen until we had enough information to approach people and start asking questions
5155263 they also have a user thats a little older and a little more sophisticated
5155264 entrepreneurs cant make an honest choice if one of our competitors is not being transparent
5155265 what ive seen from mike arrington has just been classless
5155266 i dont understand what business objective he has other than to get notoriety
5155267 being in the mud is where i partially like to stay

5155269 its because of something i call the been there done that disease
5155270 we hear about the young vote all the time and at the end of the day does it show up

5155273 as journalists were good at finding great sources of information and distinguishing whats important but we also want to harness the very significant capabilities of our community

5155285 he pretty much defines the term undersized power forward but hes never backed down from any match up the celtics drafted the more recognizable glen davis but powe hasnt given up his spot in the rotation much like kevin garnett he never takes a play off and he plays tough team defense powe even scored more points per game 7 9 than james posey and tony allen
5155286 if you want a nice guy to go about his business like a mild mannered man you can look past jason maxiell
5155287 his name is known around the league but only those who have been paying attention understand the amount of blood sweat and well more sweat that lee leaves on the court every night the man makes every second count

5155290 the man is a physical freak with a wingspan longer than youd expect explosive speed and the intelligence to read opposing players and anticipate their moves ju ju has quickly become one of the hornets best defenders while simultaneously snagging steals left and right when hes not hopping around for boards he may not have dominated the stat sheet like other rookies last year but he did a little of everything and was a total hustle player

5155306 audio theatres been missing a central place to listen and discover new work and i think echo fiction will provide an invaluable service to audio drama fans and new listeners alike
5155307 echo fiction has a selection of the best audio productions available online
5155308 i am very pleased that darker projects is able to be involved in this endeavor
5155309 one of the great challenges about producing original audio drama content for the internet is the absence of casual exposure unlike other media you never gain audience passively flipping channels or riding the tailcoats of a popular timeslot it just isnt possible by collecting original audio producers under one roof echo fiction gives producers a great opportunity to reach new audiences and provides audiences with a great one stop shopping opportunity to enjoy the best in new audio drama
5155310 echo fiction will be a wonderful tool to bring an even wider audience to dre were very thankful for the opportunity
5155311 whatever your tastes in audio theater from sci fi to horror to mysteries echo fiction has it all it is a great way for producers to connect with the listening public
5155312 before echo fiction all serious audio theatre groups were self publishing which not only made it hard for themselves to promote their own content but it also made it difficult for consumers to discover it and generate sales and advertising revenue at a material level
5155313 all of that is taken care of by bringing audio theatre producers and voice actors together under one tent freeing up producers to just focus on making content while all producers at echo fiction collectively benefit from professional web design graphic design a boost of attention and thus a boost of revenue its possible by having the market focused to a centralized source
5155314 i believe echo fiction fills a big void and solves some problems for a scattered audio theatre production community
5155315 the awards are intended to appreciate outstanding content and talent on echofiction com
5155316 as well as create an incentive for producers to work harder at creating amazing productions and generating a larger audience to support them
5155317 its about organization so we can actually be successful i tend to think of this with the saying a rising tide lifts all boats i feel that echo fiction allows audio theatre producers to join together and become far more successful because of it its good for them and its good for our audiences

5155323 i never knew that so much criminal data is available online your site is amazing i have a new hobby
5155324 i am a retired police officer and let me tell you that the information that you have you could only access if you were in law enforcement this is truly revolutionary that people can check criminal records online
5155325 looking through this database showed me the truth about my potential business partner i am so glad that i found it before i went any deeper thanks a bunch
5155326 to be honest i am always skeptical of these investigative sites on the net and i was duped a few times your site has real records and not a bunch of links to other sites
5155327 i wish i never found this site i did a check on a person whom i was dating for over 5 years and it turned out he was a registered sex offender
5155328 we are a temp agency in constant need of criminal checks you have one of the most complete and biggest criminal databases on the net nobody can bet your prices quality and service looking forward to our long lasting business relationship
5155329 lol i found my speeding ticket from 1988 how did you get this info
5155330 wallace collins has previously received 4 000 in donations from this secretive organization that took money from injured workers without their knowledge
5155331 collins has used this money for his own political purposes and should return that money at once
5155332 all candidates and those who had received funds from the working oklahomans alliance
5155333 well if were going to ask wallace collins to give back that money then we should ask all of them
5155334 because everyone who got that money should give it back
5155335 i doubt very seriously if any of these candidates or elected officials knew where that money came from
5155336 in campaigns you dont look gift horses in the mouth
5155337 i havent seen any proof that theyve done anything wrong or illegal
5155338 and i would certainly want to see proof of wrongdoing if thats what happened if mr warren can prove theyve done something illegal then id certainly like to know but just because he doesnt agree with them that doesnt mean theyve done anything illegal
5155339 they are registered with the state ethics commission so i dont know how that makes them secretive
5155340 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
5155341 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine
5155342 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems

5155346 thanks to your service i was finally able to locate and contact a former tenant it more than 80 million records from over 300 agencies with easy to follow instructions retrieve vital expect because the person i was investigating lived in a really small town here in georgia but just like you said you really can find out anything about anyone
5155347 i dont want this night to end why does it have to end
5155348 life aint fair and this growing up stuff man i dont know i just dont wanna let you go
5155349 it is clear in part from evidence that you all have published that lead managers gave the market a false sense of liquidity when real investor demand was disappearing
5155350 ubs acted against investors best interests in part by buying ars in auctions that otherwise would have failed without disclosing that fact to the market or to its customers if the allegations in attorney general cuomos complaint are true and if lead managers other than ubs engaged in similar activity the violations at the heart of the ars market downturn stem not from problems with distributing firms at the point of sale but in the relatively opaque auction process
5155351 and thats why im treating this as a sales practice issue
5155352 when this is done it will be the largest civil recovery case in history
5155353 firms like merrill lynch citigroup and wachovia can buy and hold large volumes of ars because even though their ars positions would be significant they are still small relative to the firms total assets and those firms have sufficient financial resources to carry large securities positions
5155354 today i was very very nervous because i was the favourite to win the tournament
5155355 in a final if you play your best you can win for sure but i think i played more with my mind than my body
5155356 hao qiu piaoliang every 30 seconds perhaps when the opposition wins a point say something about the skill of the shot the background of the player or what actually just happenned on the court rather than silence excuses or muttering when the chinese are trailing a point
5155357 it was a good opportunity for us to go against a quality defense
5155358 i know they had some guys out but this team is a really good team and for us to come out and put a drive together to start the game was good for our confidence
5155359 i played with luke before so it was an opportunity for us to run some old plays
5155360 he and i played together in cleveland so we have a way of connecting i kind of had an idea he was going to throw it because of the way the coverage looked we just happened to make the play
5155361 couldnt find com cenqua clover clover artifact in plugin dependencies
5155362 no doubt multipolarity will come in time in perhaps another generation or so there will be great powers coequal with the united states and the world will in structure resemble the pre world war i era
5155363 it was well here we are on top of the world and we have arrived at this peak to stay there forever
5155364 equaled if not surpassed by the power which in canada australia india in the china seas in egypt central and southern africa in the atlantic and in the mediterranean rules the peoples and governs their interests
5155365 we are a part and a great part of the greater britain which seems so plainly destined to dominate this planet
5155366 how can these little islands hold their own in the long run against such great and rich empires as the united states and germany are rapidly becoming
5155367 how can we with forty millions of people compete with states nearly double our size
5155368 the british empire is handed over to the american pawnbroker our only hope
5155369 hand will be a great deal lighter than russias germanys or japans and i suppose these are the alternatives
5155370 but you are looking at a snapshot of today the united states advantages are rapidly eroding as the country loses its scientific and technological base and suffers from inexorable cultural decay
5155371 only a fraction of potential job candidates could successfully work at a foreign company
5155372 economic time bomb u s teens are among worst at math
5155373 students in affluent suburban u s school districts score nearly as well as students in singapore the runaway leader on timss math scores
5155374 this is one reason that singaporean officials recently visited u
5155375 just by watching you can see students are more engaged instead of being spoon fed all day
5155376 will by that time have more than twice as many seniors older than 65 than children under 15 with drastic implications for future aging fewer children now means fewer workers later in the united states by contrast children will continue to outnumber the elderly the united nations population division estimates that the ratio of working age people to senior citizens in western europe will drop from 3 8 1 today to just 2 4 1 in 2030 in the u s the figure will fall from 5 4 1 to 3 1 1
5155377 every game was a battle we werent very good offensively but we did enough in other areas
5155378 being in playoff situations is a big part of development
5155379 if you want to be a championship player you have to play in those situations guys who havent been to the playoffs tend to try to do too much when they get there for the first time while the guys who have been there before know how important it is to continue playing the same game that got them there

5155383 the dubai government follows a transparent and clear policy on such issues
5155384 there are strict directives to have zero tolerance towards all aspects of corruption bribing and taking advantage of official positions
5155385 the clear policy and actions of the dubai government to fight corruption will enhance peoples confidence in dubai as a global investment destination
5155386 in the domestic markets too it will enhance the confidence level of small investors
5155387 the results of the ongoing investigations will be made public once they are complete
5155388 we welcome the government move and it will send a clear message to all stakeholders in the economy and the markets
5155389 ensuring the upholding of the very highest standards of corporate governance and transparency is critical to the long term success of both companies and governments
5155390 any employee exploiting his position to make illegal profits will not have immunity
5155391 the strictness with which some violations that emerged in the recent past were dealt with confirms the governments commitment to maintaining the highest global standards in fighting corruption and enhancing its achievements in the economic financial and legislative fields
5155392 vat has not yet been approved the government is studying the impact and wants to know all the positives and negatives so it might not do it at all may be by 2010
5155393 all the details and the date of introducing the new taxation system are yet to be finalised at the federal level
5155394 if we reach the point where it might come into effect that means we have to study all the procedures because it will affect the customs union and it will affect even the whole customs work in the uae al marri was quoted as saying
5155395 as vat is going to replace the current customs duties amounting to five per cent it will ensure price stability and help check further rise in inflation
5155396 the vat system would not have any negative effect on our inflation rates
5155397 some children particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds do not experience risks in such positive challenging or exciting ways for them risk taking can refer to threats to their safety including the threat of violence
5155398 risk taking can also refer to young people experimenting with drugs and alcohol public parks are sometimes the sites where this activity takes place
5155399 the ambiguity which results from this could lead to misinterpretation and misunderstanding particularly given recent reports and media concerns about cotton wool kids
5155400 its government talk for we have to be seen to make sure this happens
5155401 some questions might be raised about finding space for this in central london boroughs for instance it might be difficult but that is very much a council by council issue
5155402 lets see an end to the no ball games culture and a start of a new era where childrens needs and childrens play areas are at the heart of the planning process from start to finish
5155403 firstly it life is work and secondly it is relaxing company pleasures
5155404 those who believe that the cause of chinas inflation is too little pork rather than too much money are seriously mistaken
5155405 we are sticking to the 4 8 target because it helps stabilize consumer expectations
5155406 when prices soar expectations can be more horrifying than the increases
5155407 simply deploying the technology doesnt ensure uptake users want equipment to be inexpensive and easy to use and they want to be able to seamlessly switch between different tools allowing for flexible informal and intuitive communications

5155413 nuclear power is dangerous and destructive throughout its life cycle and is not a solution for climate change this proposal needs to be squashed early in the process
5155414 mainstay of pennsylvania political journalism for more than a decade
5155415 change agent whos been doin it for years here in the 15th
5155416 no siobhan bennett is a career candidate people are learning about her extraordinary hypocrisy she sends me a clean campaign pledge after she lays into me with personal unfounded attacks here she is saying that she goes to church more often than i do these are personal comments shes making
5155417 she is making personal comments about me she has a lot of nerve frankly to do that but im not at all surprised
5155418 with respect to the change agent the only change siobhan will bring to anyone will be the change left in their pockets after shes done taxing you and trying to regulate your life and to litigate this nation into what she believes will be a prosperous future
5155419 that said lets talk about people who can get things done im not trying to blow my own horn but i feel like i have to state this
5155420 mr peterson was quite clear he said if anything is going to happen were going to need this group this is one of the biggest and most difficult issues this nation is ever going to face the nations entitlement system and peterson said thats why we came to you
5155421 we had a conversation between republicans and democrats a civil exchange and this is how we start bringing people together i like to bring republicans and democrats together whenever possible
5155422 in contrast siobhan bennett is nothing but an extreme partisan
5155423 i can point to areas where ive worked across the aisle
5155424 on the homeland security committee i work closely with democratic subcommittee chair
5155425 you do that by being able to work with people
5155426 now youre seeing a status of forces agreement that we were talking about a long time ago to put some pressure on the bush administration to move in that direction
5155427 there are issues like that that we work together on all the time
5155428 i also work all the time with local officials from in bethlehem
5155429 ive worked with the mayor of allentown too and he thanks me publicly for working with them to help get some funding back to the police department and some of the citys other infrastrtucture
5155430 i work together with others all the time in larger and smaller communities
5155431 we dont ask questions of party we have a job to do and my job is to work with people i think ive done that both in washington and back here
5155432 thats quite a bit of the difference between me and siobhan
5155433 first it is quite clear that the russian bear is awake and is angry
5155434 this is unacceptable the russians must withdraw they were parties to a cease fire and they seem to have violated that cease fire they must withdraw from georgia that is the first thing that needs to occur
5155435 clearly a military option from our country is off the table nobody is seriously talking about that the issue for us is how do we appropriately appropriately sanction the russians for this egregious military action
5155436 i believe that the russian nation and certainly its current leadership feel as if theyve been humiliated after the former soviet union dissolved this was a blow to russian national pride now that you see a russia with some money they feel resurgent and confident
5155437 what youre also seeing here is the convergence of our international security situation with our energy needs this is driven not only by russian designs for territory but also by russian ambitions on the energy side of the equation
5155438 this is why we need american sources of energy so we become less susceptible to these incidents
5155439 as far as i am concerned this really is going to put a damper on and sours the relations between our nation and russia georgia is a democratically elected government and is pro western just as yushchenkos ukraine is pro western its quite clear that messrs putin and medvedev are concerned about this western orientation of some of their former republics thats also what partially drives this russian aggression towards georgia
5155440 visjonen for det nye fem rsprogrammet er at et nyskapende og kvalitetsorientert utdanningssystem m sette digital kompetanse p dagsordenen det inneb rer at b de l rere og elever skal kunne mestre teknologien p en sikker fortrolig og kreativ m te for utvikle den kunnskapen de trenger for v re fullverdige deltakere i informasjonssamfunnet
5155441 i am strongly in favor of using poisoned gas against uncivilized tribes
5155442 the american people need to know we live in a dangerous world
5155443 what takes place in the security council more closely resembles a mugging than either a political debate or an effort at problem solving
5155444 now on the precipice of a new and dangerous nuclear era
5155445 the very existence of nuclear weapons gives rise to the pursuit of them they are seen as a source of global influence and are valued for their perceived deterrent effect and as long as some countries possess them or are protected by them in alliances and others do not this asymmetry breeds chronic global insecurity
5155446 china and india are certainly increasing their share but they are not increasing their per capita emissions anywhere close to the levels that you have in the developed world
5155447 we dont want to have our granddaughter abused by these people
5155448 the child support was the icing on the cake i couldnt believe that our son has to pay child support to his abuser
5155449 it is an age and maturity issue not a gender issue
5155450 hes a young boy coming into his own being taken advantage of by an adult
5155451 i have made what i consider to be a reasonable offer but i have not received a response
5155452 he is a father even though it was a crime for him to be a father his life is changed forever
5155453 if the day comes when he has to sit down to perform he will say not a chance he likes to stomp his feet abiyoyo requires some running around
5155454 i wanted him to roll his rs and things like that he said if its so bad you come up onstage and i did
5155455 its lovely how we can all play together as a unit but have our own voices and own perspectives
5155456 its a nice metaphor i wish more people would take the time to play this way

5155462 if we ever leave a legacy its that we loved each other well
5155463 what youre saying makes a whole lot of sense now how can we solve this problem
5155464 so i strive always to keep my conscience clear before god and man
5155465 shall the county enact an ordinance to increase real estate taxes in order to repeal the alcoholic drink tax
5155466 this is the first step in challenging that whole process that they went through to put a referendum question on the ballot
5155467 the lawsuit is an attempt to reverse the power they gave themselves they are circumventing the county charter
5155468 the administrative code requires us to return the petition to fact
5155469 we have a problem with the wording of the anti drink tax referendum question it simply asks the voter to make a decision if they want lower taxes
5155470 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
5155471 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour

5155483 i tried reading your blog but i couldnt fucking understand any of it
5155484 the orienteering point for visitors who arrive through deep links and then decide to explore the site further
5155485 how are people the people i need to reach interact with and tell stories to going to use this new power and how can i help them achieve their goals
5155486 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
5155487 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
5155488 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
5155489 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
5155490 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
5155491 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
5155492 the reality is that the investment cost of solar panels on a per watt basis is five dollars without import duty
5155493 maybe a large array can be bought at three dollars
5155494 while the investment is three times that of conventional technology it is used only 16 percent of the time
5155495 despite sunlight being free of charge until the capital costs come down theres no way it can compete with large power plants
5155496 wherever you see solar panels theres a subsidy coming to the user
5155497 creo que durante la semana mi tenis mejor pero hoy me toc la mala suerte de tener a rafa nadal pasando un gran momento

5155503 its a dog its ok you can get another one relax
5155504 obama might just have to create a department of hate crimes and put them in jail
5155505 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
5155506 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
5155507 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
5155508 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca
5155509 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
5155510 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
5155511 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
5155512 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
5155513 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
5155514 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
5155515 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
5155516 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
5155517 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5155518 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
5155519 nous avons t enchant s par les succ s de l v nement 2006
5155520 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
5155521 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
5155522 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5155523 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
5155524 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
5155525 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
5155526 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
5155527 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
5155528 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
5155529 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
5155530 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
5155531 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
5155532 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
5155533 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
5155534 au del du profit nous avons un devoir patriotique vis vis de la nation

5155544 untuk memenuhi kabutuhan 10 000 kalori dalam sehari phelps tentu perlu makan terus menerus sepanjang hari
5155545 atlet perlu lemak tetapi mereka harus selektif dalam pemilihan jenisnya bila memungkinkan pilihlah makanan dengan kadar lemak tak jenuh unsaturated fat seperti minyak zaitun atau canola oil alpukat kacang kacangan dan biji bijian
5155546 kami anjurkan para atlet mengonsumsi makanan berkalori tinggi namun volumenya kecil oleh sebab itu granola dengan buah dan yogurt akan menjadi pilihan yang baik ketimbang sereal dengan susu
5155547 dalam 15 menit setelah lomba phelps harus melahap makanan kecil yang terdiri dari dua pertiga karbohidrat dan sepertiga protein dengan sedikit lemak sehat untuk mengawali dan mengoptimalkan proses pemulihan

5155598 the key is to always follow the bent of your nature and you will find peace and happiness
5155599 raise up a child in the way it should go
5155600 raise up a child in the way he is bent
5155601 the meaning being that we should accept individual personality and characteristics of each child which was given to them by the creator and use those characteristics to the childs benefit and well being rather than changing them because we may think they are offensive or disruptive if we try to change the nature of a child and want them to be someone they are not they will be unhappy
5155602 teach us love compassion and honor that we may heal the earth and heal each other
5155603 this is the most interesting history and time for finance its also incredibly complicated
5155604 the thing about covering business and finance is it is incredibly fascinating and it affects everybodys life

5155608 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5155609 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5155610 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5155611 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5155612 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5155613 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5155614 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5155615 where are the bloggers of color and why arent we reading them

5155623 he has refused to listen to us on a critical issue to our community the right to live at home in the community
5155624 the community choice act would allow that obama will give us choice and help us liberate the people in nursing homes
5155625 mommy at work you have two and at home you have one tell me more about it
5155626 no mommy insert eye roll you have two and one that is three what is that can you show me

5155630 in our relationship with the north there always exists the possibility of localized conflict so we cannot afford to loosen our readiness
5155631 to start a new war on the peninsula and stifle the north with force
5155632 it is quite nonsensical for the u s to offer a handshake to its dialogue partner while holding a dagger in its other hand
5155633 imagine a world which preserves nature the air the rivers where we can produce more with fewer pesticides without destroying the forests imagine a world with more food with more nutritious food and people with better health can you imagine it ah but you never imagined that gmos could help us do this have you ever thought of a better world you should think like we do a monsanto initiative with the support of the associa o brasileira de nutrologia
5155634 babies fed with a bottle might become undernourished if they are fed infant formula made with gmos as there is inadequate regulation and regimented tests for transgenic foods
5155635 the only difference between us and them is were here and theyre there
5155636 if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land
5155637 its overwhelming and for it to be four of them its overwhelming
5155638 i think children are just left alone on their own too much
5155639 they need someone to be there with them to help them out to guide them
5155640 a written warning on the first offense 25 fine on the second offense 50 fine on the third offense is not enough and i hate the fact that we have to have a curfew but we have to motivate these parents to get involved in these childrens lives
5155641 it seems as if they dont want to grow up even though they have children
5155642 they still want to live a lifestyle like i dont want to have responsibilities but children are a lot of responsibility
5155643 unfortunately weve had too many mothers crying over their lost kids kids that have died in the streets of birmingham
5155644 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5155645 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5155646 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5155647 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5155648 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5155649 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5155650 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5155651 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5155652 allein intels prozessor verk ufe sind im vergleich zum vorhergehenden quartal um 4 3 prozent und um 20 8 prozent gegen ber dem vorjahr gewachsen w hrend amds prozessor verk ufe ungef hr gleich blieben
5155653 you add that all up and its not a good year to be running as a republican in wisconsin for president
5155654 its an open question how much the race tightens up and whether wisconsin turns out to be right on the cusp nationally like it has been in previous elections or whether it leans democratic
5155655 for a lot of the states that were very close in the last election given the condition in the country and that sen mccain is wearing the bush mantle whether he likes it or not youre going to see obamas share of the vote go up by 3 4 5 percentage points in those states and theyre not going to be as close as they were
5155656 we think that right now iowa is a very strong pickup for us and thats important
5155657 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started
5155658 why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
5155659 if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
5155660 more than 100 fiscally and socially conservative members of congress who seek to return the republican party to its ronald reagan roots
5155661 the quality i believe gives me the advantage is that i am the only non politician someone who will truly be a citizen legislator who is ready to lead
5155662 were bringing to light issues that other candidates are obviously trying to avoid discussing because they know that these issues would keep them from getting elected
5155663 they made the decision that they thought would work best for them

5155672 de cipiers hebben de politie recht op het gezicht geslagen zulke mensen horen zelf achter tralies

5155676 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5155677 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5155678 i didnt know james orthwein well but i did share one of my lifes most memorable moments with him and my family back on january 21 1994 that was the day that i purchased the new england patriots from mr orthwein
5155679 i have a great black and white photo of the two of us sitting at a table that day with my entire family standing behind us it is a day that i will never forget and a memory that i will always cherish on behalf of my family i would like to extend sympathies to the orthwein family
5155680 jim was a private man who thrived as a fisherman outdoorsman and painter
5155681 yet he understood business and he had an enormous talent to see what was important and then connect his product be it candy or cola or beer or the then broken and ridiculed patriot franchise to the public

5155684 i have heard anecdotal evidence that bands are cutting back and not showing as many costumes as they had planned
5155685 we have already approached 70 companies in the past year
5155686 our budget this year is 9 000 to 10 000 but so far we have only raised 2 000
5155687 the way things are in the economy it is affecting how people in the arts are getting funds
5155688 instead of 80 participants we will have 40 at our best we have 60 to 70 costumes but that will also be reduced
5155689 this year we have had to compromise instead of the usual 12 big costumes we just will have just four or five with very basic material
5155690 we are still trying to get funding we are spending all this from our own pockets
5155691 its a last minute fight we have got all the top urban artists who play for free for us but no platform for them to perform on
5155692 we have all the icing and candles but no cake this year it has been very bad
5155693 we have found it quite difficult to find funds from trusts as they find the project high risk
5155694 when they bands approach sponsors they tend to approach with a fixed proposition and price as opposed to what sponsors want to achieve
5155695 the funds for this programme have been reduced due to declining income from the national lottery
5155696 some of this has been diverted to the 2012 olympic and paralympic games
5155697 this has meant that it has become a more competitive scheme where applications need to be stronger

5155719 ive spent enough time as a photography director hunting for a phone number or
5155720 how much time will a potential client spend on your website ill bet the average is around 20 seconds but ive spent as little as 1 second and as long as 10 minutes on a site the first impression is critical thats where the 1 second comes in because if the design logo and the first image i see dont add up to a certain taste level then im probably wasting my time
5155721 in my eyes the control panels and administrative interfaces are what make or break an application for me a product can have a beautiful design but if i have to do too many manual steps to get work done the work wont get done
5155722 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5155723 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5155724 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5155725 we are waiting for more support from other countries because this is not a war between russian and georgia its a war between civilization and barbarism
5155726 dieser punkt ist in meinen augen nicht verhandelbar er muss alle russischen streitkr fte betreffen die seit dem 7 august nach georgien gekommen sind
5155727 we are big fans of the mac experience so we realised there was huge scope to improve the experience small business owners were having inputting and analysing their financial information
5155728 were always on the lookout for cool new web apps and i find it quite funny that i am so excited about one that does accounting but i am
5155729 what i also like about xero is that it looks good not something that you immediately think of as necessary when doing your accounts but for me its so obvious the designers have thought about how people work and what they want to be able to look at all the headline data is there for me to see easily which is quite often all i want to know
5155730 the best way i can think to describe how happy i am with xero is i use it all the time from not even looking at the accounts side of the business i am now using xero all the time to run invoices look at the bank statements and all sorts of accounting things i never wanted to know about before and i am enjoying it

5155881 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5155882 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared

5155944 i believe the cuts go too far in some instances and im unhappy to see the reinstatement of the higher corporate tax rate and other taxes but no one has put together a plan to balance the budget without significant new revenues
5155945 runs the risk of putting california on the brink of bankruptcy along with many of its citizens and businesses
5155946 we have a 15 billion deficit thanks to the irresponsible budget choices by democrats in this legislature spending on new programs and bigger government
5155947 we are ready with a compassionate balanced budget that meets the governors demands and will keep our economy strong maintain our commitment to education and protect the states most vulnerable citizens
5155948 we need a spending limit to force the state to save money
5155949 if the cuts weve proposed arent deep enough what cuts would you make
5155950 its time to get real its time to get practical its time to get it done
5155951 i want to come up here and be a responsible adult lets just fix this
5155952 the past is history the future a mystery but today is a gift thats why its called the present

5155957 en la calle todo esta obscuro hoy son las 18 y agosto de 12 00am del 2008 todo patas pa arriba los relojes no se han parado como en algunos escritos y tiempos literarios ac los relojes corren la calle esta gris igual que siempre gris ltimamente no hay mangos bajitos todo esta para salir corriendo de esta cuidad el olor a muerto no se va el suelo no huele igual despu s de la lluvia no hay gente en las calle las ventanas como en buen invierno permanecen cerradas nadie al parecer no quieren despedir el verano les da lo mismo si se va o no ac llueve no cuando al cielo se le antoja pero cuando en el pent gono hay fiesta parece que estamos en tiempos de guerra camino camino camino el olor a muerto no se quita de las puertas en la ventanas las huellas del silencio traspasan y acarician mis piernas y yo con los ojos cerrados respiro profundo y siento miedo mucho miedo quiero estar sola y la calle no esta buena en casa no permiten descansar los recuerdos los destellos de luz y de memoria el sue o no llega y los duendes salan y saltan por mis cabellos quiero estar sola pero esta multitud no permite no deja respirar la nostalgia es mala de por vida mala y camina de lado se repite y en mi mente la gente los recuerdos que son ineludibles ah record ndome constantemente que estoy viva que pertenezco a la multitud que ella exige y yo no soy suficiente y en los bolsillos cargo la soledad capaz y un d a de estos me de por sacarla y mandarlo todo a la mierda
5155958 the safir ambassador rocket was successfully launched all its systems are iranian made
5155959 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in future
5155960 the second launch of the safir rocket carrying the first satellite omid was conducted successfully
5155961 the iranian media is mistaken it was the launch of a rocket capable of carrying a satellite the omid satellite was not launched itself
5155962 the achievement has drawn much attention from around the world especially from among muslim nations as iran is under heavy sanctions by the west and the un security council making it develop the technology and build every part and equipment needed in the field of aerospace
5155963 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians
5155964 by tunneling deep into their pasts their paranoias and anxieties their troubled romantic relationships their outsize dreams lacy delivers a sophisticated psychological study of an ascendant economic class

5155966 the vile by the israel based psytrance goa band limbo
5155967 fue un partido parejo pero creo que los andes hizo m s merecimientos para quedarse con la victoria tal vez no creamos tantas situaciones de gol pero mejoramos mucho con respecto a la fecha pasada ante defensa eso quiere decir que vamos por el buen camino y tenemos que seguir de esta forma
5155968 con el beto cada vez me siento mejor igualmente todav a tenemos que conocernos m s y eso se va a ganar con el correr de los partidos para nosotros lo m s importante es hacer goles y esta vez no tuvimos muchas situaciones ojal que con belgrano tengamos m s ocasiones de gol y podamos sacar un buen resultado
5155969 cambiamos de esquema y no sinti en lo personal en el encuentro anterior jugu como volante central y ahora me toc compartir el mediocampo con ruiz la verdad yo no tengo ning n problema ac lo m s importante es los andes el equipo trabaja de acuerdo a lo que pide el t cnico y si es para el bien del grupo bienvenido sea
5155970 empatamos pero voy conforme con el planteo que hicimos despu s del inicio del s bado pasado necesit bamos una actuaci n como sta metimos en todas las l neas estuvimos s lidos atr s intentamos jugar y creo que lo pudimos haber ganado ellos casi no inquietaron nuestro arco y eso me parece que es merito nuestro esperemos que este punto sea un puntapi para lo que viene
5155971 en un momento el partido se cay un poco y eso tiene que ver con que los dos equipos se conocen bastante adem s al no querer perder se especula un poco m s pero a lo largo de los 90 minutos nosotros tuvimos mayor convicci n y demostramos que merec amos el triunfo ellos intentaron aprovechar los espacios y plantearon un encuentro similar al que hicimos nosotros con defensa tal vez a diferencia de la semana pasada a los andes le cost crear situaciones
5155972 i put everything in these words all ive seen and all ive heard
5155973 hiiiiiiiiiii i can afford a 5 skinny latte every morning of course i only drink sssssskim miiiilk
5155974 i have had 120 something games and that is the worst i have used the ball i wish they could have just given it to someone else who could kick it a bit better than me
5155975 it is not his fault we kick it to him so much it is our fault for making the wrong decisions going inside 50
5155976 you got some old heads there like tiato and craig moore and they are not going to take a backward step they never are
5155977 it is going to be interesting to see sasa on the other side now
5155978 its very old 50 years old or more in some places
5155979 i looked out the window and there was just water everywhere flowing down the street super fast and i just thought oh no the canal broke again
5155980 this is now two years in a row and last year it was like oh no its a freak accident
5155981 but this year its kind of like how does this happen twice
5155982 i was getting my generator ready because last year they ended up shutting the power off
5155983 last year our yard wasnt in this year my landscaping was just about done and now somebody will be back out there and well probably have to re sod
5155984 how do you explain to somebody that it floods every year here
5155985 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5155986 the same old folks that brought you the same team
5155987 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5155988 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5155989 bringing it back to the old days when we had many people with personal bests under 45 seconds
5155990 de senaste ren har inte studenternas ekonomi f rs mrats
5155991 ibland blir inte allt som man har t nkt sig
5155992 when demand for homes drops ordinary sellers will take their homes off the market let them sit or reduce their prices in small increments but banks will slash prices to where the homes will sell quickly
5155993 now were getting into a time when the real economy is starting to affect housing markets more
5155994 its a little bit of a contest now will lower prices stimulate home sales or will the slowing economy slow down sales
5155995 the biggest home sales gains over the previous quarter have been in some of the markets with the steepest and fastest price drops
5155996 buyers in these areas are responding to deeply discounted home prices
5155997 loan officers are reporting that they are still tightening underwriting standards
5155998 we expect that sales volume which has leveled off some will drop another 10 over the next few months over this credit squeeze
5155999 i have heard anecdotal evidence that bands are cutting back and not showing as many costumes as they had planned
5156000 we have already approached 70 companies in the past year
5156001 our budget this year is 9 000 to 10 000 but so far we have only raised 2 000
5156002 the way things are in the economy it is affecting how people in the arts are getting funds
5156003 instead of 80 participants we will have 40 at our best we have 60 to 70 costumes but that will also be reduced
5156004 this year we have had to compromise instead of the usual 12 big costumes we just will have just four or five with very basic material
5156005 we are still trying to get funding we are spending all this from our own pockets
5156006 its a last minute fight we have got all the top urban artists who play for free for us but no platform for them to perform on
5156007 we have all the icing and candles but no cake this year it has been very bad
5156008 we have found it quite difficult to find funds from trusts as they find the project high risk
5156009 when they bands approach sponsors they tend to approach with a fixed proposition and price as opposed to what sponsors want to achieve
5156010 the funds for this programme have been reduced due to declining income from the national lottery
5156011 some of this has been diverted to the 2012 olympic and paralympic games
5156012 this has meant that it has become a more competitive scheme where applications need to be stronger
5156013 lead follow or get the he out of the way
5156014 they get hit by cars they run into power lines they get shot they eat things they shouldnt eat that have poison on them one of the compelling factors is that most of those things have something to do with us
5156015 perhaps we will make changes in our lives to better protect the birds
5156016 i was just so fascinated by the book and i really wanted to come
5156017 we have made our navigation system run on the iphone it looks good and works very well
5156018 we will have to look more closely to apples strategy before we can say more about what kind of opportunities this will bring us
5156019 what makes this any different from the notes app that comes with the iphone
5156020 and god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them
5156021 and god blessed them put his hands over them and pronounced them blessed
5156022 so the people served the lord all the days of joshua and all the days of the elders who outlived joshua who had seen all the great works of the lord which he had done for israel
5156023 when all that generation had been gathered to their fathers another generation arose after them who did not know the lord nor the work which he had done for israel then the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and served the baals
5156024 we will not hide them from their children telling to the generation to come the praises of the lord and his strength and his wonderful works that he has done
5156025 and the anger of the lord was hot against israel so he delivered them into the hands of plunderers who despoiled them and he sold them into the hands of their enemies all around
5156026 nevertheless the lord raised up judges who delivered them out of the hand of those who plundered them
5156027 i exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men
5156028 and i sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that i should not destroy it but i found none
5156029 to bow our heads in prayer is the beginning of an uprising against the disorder of the world
5156030 if we believe not yet he abides faithful he cannot deny himself
5156031 touching the almighty we cannot find him out he is excellent in power and in judgment and in plenty of justice he will not afflict
5156032 but who is able to build him an house seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him
5156033 let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempts he any man
5156034 thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil and canst not look on iniquity
5156035 let us not give up meeting together as some are in the habit of doing but let us encourage one another
5156036 what a miracle you go out to the garden and you pour miracle grow onto your plants and they flourish a man for the first time plants a footprint on the moon and everybody called it a miracle
5156037 the lord is near to all who call upon him to all who call upon him in truth
5156038 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5156039 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5156040 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5156041 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5156042 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5156043 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5156044 he couldve ended up dead im really angry at the people who dont follow the rules
5156045 the real concerns are people driving 4 000 pound machines that have the ability to kill pedestrians cyclists and people in wheelchairs
5156046 in 22 years of commuting to oakland i have never seen a cyclist stop at a red light or stop sign
5156047 theres a physics argument on why some bikers dont stop at stop signs
5156048 i dont see why bikes are special and not subject to the speed limit
5156049 it is my intention to make sure everyone understands those laws
5156050 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5156051 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5156052 it just wasnt a good day for me to have an off day
5156053 weve had a tough time with them this year today the better team won
5156054 i know we were expecting and planning some medals from our team but i dont think anyone could expect three medals

5156062 where is he that is born king of the jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him
5156063 in bethlehem of judaea for thus it is written by the prophet micah 5 1 6and thou bethlehem in the land of juda art not the least among the princes of juda for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people israel
5156064 go and search diligently for the young child and when ye have found him bring me word again that i may come and worship him also
5156065 hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
5156066 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
5156067 i just didnt have the legs but i promise you i gave 100 per cent
5156068 i wanted more i really did i guess i was just a bit tired
5156069 i think most people who dont understand the sport would think shes sort of olympic champion material and shes not to be brutally honest
5156070 she ran close to her fastest time ever in the heats just to make it through to the semi finals and she made it through as one of the non automatic qualifiers
5156071 i have no doubts that when i line up next week on the start line i will look left and right and know the other girls arent all clean
5156072 i think she obviously had put herself under a bit of pressure with some of the comments shes made prior to competing and i dont think that really helped matters
5156073 also i dont think the fact she ran the 400m would have helped for her result but also would have made her feel very very tired so im sure that probably didnt help matters either
5156074 the poor girl obviously she had a lot of expectations on her going into this olympics because of the fact she won a world indoor title this year
5156075 it just basically means that people assume shes going to be a medal contender
5156076 she definitely did have a shot unfortunately she did run the 400m flat that morning which did take a lot out of her
5156077 theres only really three or four hours break she had in between you cant do that in track and field were not swimmers were not good at backing up
5156078 its a hard lesson to learn at the top level but i think shell come back from it

5156088 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5156089 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5156090 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5156091 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5156129 there will of course be a universal language which will be either esperanto or pidgin english the literature of the past will for the most part not be translated into this language since its outlook and emotional background will be considered unsettling serious students of history will be able to obtain a permit from the government to study such works as hamlet and othello but the general public will be forbidden access to them on the ground that they glorify private murder boys will not be allowed to read books about pirates or red indians love themes will be discouraged on the ground that love being anarchic is silly if not wicked all this will make life very pleasant for the virtuous
5156130 the nineteenth century suffered from a curious division between its political ideas and its economic practice in politics it carried out the liberal ideas of locke and rousseau which were adapted to a society of small peasant proprietors its watchwords were liberty and equality but meantime it was inventing the technique which is leading the twentieth century to destroy liberty and to replace equality by new forms of oligarchy the prevalence of liberal thought has been in some ways a misfortune since it has prevented men of large vision from thinking out in an impersonal manner the problems raised by industrialism socialism and communism it is true are essentially industrial creeds but their outlook is so much dominated by the class war that they have little leisure to give to anything but the means of achieving political victory traditional morality gives very little help in the modern world a rich man may plunge millions into destitution by some act which not even the severest catholic confessor would consider sinful while he will need absolution for a trivial sexual aberration which at the worst has wasted an hour that might have been more usefully employed there is need of a new doctrine on the subject of my duty to my neighbour it is not only traditional religious teaching that fails to give adequate guidance on this subject but also the teaching of nineteenth century liberalism take for example such a book as mill on liberty mill maintains that while the state has a right to interfere with those of my actions that have serious consequences to others it should leave me free where the effects of my actions are mainly confined to myself such a principle however in the modern world leaves hardly any scope for individual freedom as society becomes more organic the effects of men upon each other become more and more numerous and important so that there remains hardly anything in regard to which mills defence of liberty is applicable take for example freedom of speech and of the press it is clear that a society that permits these is thereby precluded from various achievements which are possible to a society that forbids them in time of war this is obvious to everybody because in war time the national purpose is simple and the causation involved is obvious hitherto it has not been customary for a nation in peace time to have any national purpose except the preservation of its territory and its constitution a government which like that of soviet russia has a purpose in peace time as ardent and definite as that of other nations in war time is compelled to curtail freedom of speech and of the press as much while it is at peace as other nations do when they are at war the diminution of individual liberty which has been taking place during the last twenty years is likely to continue since it has two continuing causes on the one hand modern technique makes society more organic on the other hand modern sociology makes men more and more aware of the causal laws in virtue of which one mans acts are useful or harmful to another man if we are to justify any particular form of individual liberty in the scientific society of the future we shall have to do it on the ground that that form of liberty is for the good of society as a whole but not in most cases on the ground that the acts concerned affect nobody but the agent
5156131 the man who dreams of a scientifically organized world and wishes to translate his dream into practice finds himself faced with many obstacles there is the opposition of inertia and habit people wish to continue behaving as they always have behaved and living as they always have lived there is the opposition of vested interest an economic system inherited from feudal times gives advantages to men who have done nothing to deserve them and these men being rich and powerful are able to place formidable obstacles in the way of fundamental change in addition to these forces there are also hostile idealisms christian ethics is in certain fundamental respects opposed to the scientific ethic which is gradually growing up christianity emphasizes the importance of the individual soul and is not prepared to sanction the sacrifice of an innocent man for the sake of some ulterior good to the majority christianity in a word is unpolitical as is natural since it grew up among men devoid of political power the new ethic which is gradually growing in connexion with scientific technique will have its eye upon society rather than upon the individual it will have little use for the superstition of guilt and punishment but will be prepared to make individuals suffer for the public good without inventing reasons purporting to show that they deserve to suffer in this sense it will be ruthless and according to traditional ideas immoral but the change will have come about naturally through the habit of viewing society as a whole rather than as a collection of individuals we view a human body as a whole and if for example it is necessary to amputate a limb we do not consider it necessary to prove first that the limb is wicked we consider the good of the whole body a quite sufficient argument similarly the man who thinks of society as a whole will sacrifice a member of society for the good of the whole without much consideration for that individuals welfare this has always been the practice in war because war is a collective enterprise soldiers are exposed to the risk of death for the public good although no one suggests that they deserve death but men have not hitherto attached the same importance to social purposes other than war and have therefore shrunk from inflicting sacrifices which were felt to be unjust i think it probable that the scientific idealists of the future will be free from this scruple not only in time of war but in time of peace also in overcoming the difficulties of the opposition that they will encounter they will find themselves organized into an oligarchy of opinion such as is formed by the communist party in the u s s r
5156132 in suggesting any curtailment of liberty there are always two quite distinct questions to be considered the first is whether such a curtailment would be in the public interest if it were wisely carried out and the second is whether it will be in the public interest when it is carried out with a certain measure of ignorance and perversity these two questions are in theory quite distinct but from the point of view of the government the second question does not exist since every government believes itself entirely free from both ignorance and perversity every government consequently in so far as it is not restrained by traditional prejudices will advocate more interference with liberty than is wise when therefore as in this chapter we are considering what interferences with liberty might be theoretically justified we must hesitate to draw the conclusion that they should be advocated in practice i think it probable however that almost all interferences with liberty for which there is a theoretical justification will in time be carried out in practice because scientific technique is gradually making governments so strong that they need not consider outside opinion the result of this will be that governments will be able to interfere with individual liberty wherever in their opinion there is a sound reason for so doing and for the reason just given this will be much more often than it should be for this reason scientific technique is likely to lead to a governmental tyranny which may in time prove disastrous
5156133 let us take some examples of traditional principles which appear no longer defensible to take a more important illustration consider the immense sums of money that are spent on advertising it cannot possibly be maintained that these bring any but the most meagre return to the community the principle of permitting each capitalist to invest his money as he chooses is not therefore socially defensible
5156134 take again the question of work both the kind of work and the method of performing it at present young people choose their own trade or profession usually because at the moment of their choice it seems to afford a good opening a well informed person possessed of foresight might know that the particular line in question was going to be much less profitable a few years hence in such a case some public guidance to the young might prove extremely useful and as regards technical methods it is seldom in the public interest that an antiquated or wasteful technique should be allowed to persist when a more economical technique is known at present owning to the irrational character of the capitalist system the interest of the individual wage earner is very often opposed to the interest of the community since economical methods may cause him to lose his job this is due to the survival of capitalistic principles in a society which has grown so organic that it ought not to tolerate them it is obvious that in a well organized community it should be impossible for a large body of individuals to profit by preserving an inefficient technique it is clear that the use of the most efficient technique should be enforced and no wage earner should be allowed to suffer by its enforcement
5156135 i come now to a matter which touches the individual more intimately i mean the question of propagation it has hitherto been considered that any man and woman not within the prohibited degrees have a right to marry and having married have a right if not a duty to have as many children as nature may decree this is a right which the scientific society of the future is not likely to tolerate in any given state of industrial and agricultural technique there is an optimum density of population which ensures a greater degree of material well being than would result from either an increase or a diminution of numbers as a general rule except in new countries the density of population has been beyond this optimum though perhaps france in recent decades has been an exception except where there is property to be inherited the member of a small family suffers almost as much from over population as the member of a large family those who cause over population are therefore doing an injury not only to their own children but to the community it may therefore be assumed that society will discourage them if necessary as soon as religious prejudices no longer stand in the way of such action the same question will arise in a more dangerous form as between different nations and different races if a nation finds that it is losing military superiority through a lower birth rate than that of a rival it may attempt as has already been done in such cases to stimulate its own birth rate but when this proves ineffective as it probably will there will be a tendency to demand a limitation in the birth rate of the rival nation an international government if it ever comes into being will have to take account of such matters and just as there is at present a quota of national immigrants into the united states so in future there will be a quota of national immigrants into the world children in excess of the licensed figure will presumably be subjected to infanticide this would be less cruel than the present method which is to kill them by war or starvation i am however only prophesying a certain future not advocating it quality as well as quantity of population is likely to become a matter for public regulation already in many states of america it is permissible to sterilized the mentally defective and a similar proposal in england is in the domain of practical politics this is only the first step as time goes on we may expect a greater and greater percentage of the population to be regarded as mentally defective from the point of view of parenthood however that may be it is clear that the parents who have a child when there is every likelihood of its being mentally defective are doing a wrong both to the child and to the community no defensible principle of liberty therefore stands in the way of preventing them from such behaviour
5156136 equality like liberty is difficult to reconcile with scientific technique since this involves a great apparatus of experts and officials inspiring and controlling vast organizations
5156137 there will be in the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude and producing dictatorship without tears so to speak producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them but will rather enjoy it because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods and this seems to be the final revolution

5156164 intra et extra muros ecclesiae inside and outside the walls of the church the theologian will in fact often enough cast about in vain for companions who are also filled with wonder who are also committed at his side he will surely find a few companions and only of these few can he be moderately sure
5156165 a person may easily become desperate bitter skeptical perhaps even bellicose and mean inclined as an accuser to turn permanently against his fellow men on account of their lifelong folly and wickedess

5156190 most people most interested in flying cars were already pilots
5156191 they wanted to drive to a local airport take off land at their destination and then reverse the whole process to come home
5156192 people basically structure their lives around where they live and work we are a car based society and 75 of our travel is less than 80 miles so people want something that acts more like a car than a plane
5156193 once we have enough of them out there some history and some backing we can go out and attract the 250 million we need
5156194 we feel we can sell at least 1 000 kits a year
5156195 eventually the common vision of having a flying car is going to be true
5156196 we had this sort of optimism in the 50s and 60s a feeling that things were inevitable because of technology and flying cars were on the short list

5156215 in the old days it was expected that about half the children in a family would die before they grew up this involved pain illness and sorrow to the mother often great suffering to the children and a waste of natural resources in the care of children who never lived to become productive
5156216 such a state of affairs will have both merits and demerits more important than either however is the fact that nothing less will enable a society imbued with scientific technique to survive scientific technique demands organization and the more it becomes perfected the larger are the organizations that it demands quite apart from war the present depression has made it evident that an international organization of credit and banking is necessary to the prosperity not only of some countries but of all the international organization of industrial production is being rendered necessary by the efficiency of modern methods modern industrial plants can easily supply in many directions much more than the total needs of the world the result of this which should be wealth is in fact poverty owing to competition in the absence of competition the immensely enhanced productivity of labour would enable men to arrive at a just compromise between leisure and goods they could choose whether they would work six hours a day and be rich or four hours a day and enjoy only moderate comfort the advantages of world wide organization both in preventing the waste of economic competition and in removing the danger of war are so great as to be becoming an essential condition for the survival of societies possessing scientific technique this argument is overwhelming in comparison with all counterarguments and renders almost unimportant the question whether life in an organized world state will be more or less satisfactory than life at the present day for it is only in the direction of an organized world state that the human race can develop unless it abandons scientific technique and it will not do this except as the result of a cataclysm so severe as to lower the whole level of civilization the advantages to be derived from an organized world state are great and obvious there will be in the first place security against war and a saving of almost the whole effort and expense now devoted to competitive armaments there will be one must suppose a single highly efficient fighting machine employing mainly aeroplanes and chemical methods of warfare which will be quite obviously irresistible and will therefore not be resisted the central government may be changed from time to time by a palace revolution but this will only alter the personnel of the figure heads not the essential organization of government the central government will of course forbid the propaganda of nationalism by means of which at present anarchy is maintained and will put in its place a propaganda of loyalty to the world state
5156217 we have seen that scientific civilization demands world wide organization if it is to be stable we have considered the possibility of such an organization in matters of government we shall now consider it in the economic sphere at present production is organized as far as possible nationally be means of tariff walls every nation tries to produce at home as much as possible of the goods that it consumes this tendency is on the increase and even great britain which has hitherto aimed at maximizing its exports by means of free trade appears to be on the point of abandoning this policy in favour of comparative economic isolation it is of course clear that from a purely economic point of view it is wasteful to organize production nationally rather than internationally it would be an economy if all the motor cars used throughout the world were manufactured in detroit that is to say a car of given excellence could be produced with less expense of human labour in that case than it can at present in a world scientifically organized most industrial products would be thus localized there would be one place for making pins and needles another place for making scissors and knives another place for making aeroplanes and yet another for agricultural machinery when if ever the world government that we have considered comes into being one of its first tasks will be the international organization of production production will no longer be left as at present to private enterprise but will be undertaken solely in accordance with government orders this is already the case with such things as battleships because in regard to war efficiency is thought to be important but in most matters production is left to the chaotic impulses of private manufacturers who make too much of some things and too little of others with the result that there is poverty in the midst of unused plenty the industrial plant at present existing in the world is in many directions far in excess of the worlds needs by eliminating competition and concentrating production in a single concern all this waste could be avoided the control of raw materials is a matter which in any scientific society would be governed by a central authority at present the important raw materials are controlled by military power the weak nation possessed of oil soon finds itself under suzerainty of some stronger nation the transvaal lost its independence because it contained gold raw material ought not to belong to those who by conquest or diplomacy have happened to acquire the territory in which they are they ought to belong to a world authority which would ration them to those who had the most skill in utilizing them moreover our present economic system causes everybody to be wasteful of raw materials since there is no motive for foresight in a scientific world the supply of any vital raw material will be carefully estimated and as the moment of its exhaustion approaches scientific research will be directed to the discovery of a substitute agriculture for reasons which we considered in an earlier chapter may have less importance in the future than it has at present and has had in the past we shall have not only artificial silk but artificial wool and artificial timber and artificial rubber in time we may have artificial food but in the meantime agriculture will become more and more industrialized both in its methods and in the mentality of those who practise it american and canadian agriculturists have already the industrial mentality not the mentality of the patient peasant machinery will of course be increasingly employed in the neighbourhood of large urban markets intensive cultivation with artificial methods of warming the soil will yield many crops every year here and there throughout the country side there will be large power stations forming the nucleus around which the population will cluster of agricultural mentality as it has been known since ancient times nothing will survive since the soil and even the climate will be subject to human control
5156218 the gain from an economic point of view will be enormous there will be no waste in competitive production no uncertainty as to employment no poverty no sudden alternations of good and bad times every man willing to work will be kept in comfort and every man unwilling to work will be kept in prison when owing to any circumstances the work upon which a man has hitherto been employed is no longer required he will be taught some new kind of work and will be adequately maintained while he is learning his new trade economic motives will be employed to regulate population which will probably be kept stationary almost all that is tragic in human life will be eliminated and even death will seldom come before old age
5156219 it may be assumed that every man and woman will be obliged to work and will be taught a new trade if for any reason work at the old trade is no longer required the pleasantest work of course will be that which gives the most control over the mechanism the posts giving most power will presumably be awarded to the ablest men as a result of intelligence tests for entirely inferior work negroes will be employed wherever possible one may i suppose assume that the most desirable kinds of work will be more highly paid than the less desirable kinds since they require more skill the society will not be one in which there is equality although i doubt whether the inequalities will be hereditary except as between different races i e between white and coloured labour everybody will be comfortable and those who occupy the better paid posts will be able to enjoy considerable luxury there will not be as at present fluctuations of good and bad times for these are merely the result of our anarchic economic system nobody will starve and nobody will suffer the economic anxieties which at present beset rich and poor alike on the other hand life will be destitute of adventure except for the most highly paid experts ever since civilization began men have been seeking security more avidly than they have sough anything else in such a world they will have it but i am not quite sure whether they will think it worth the price that they will have paid for it
5156220 take again the question of work both the kind of work and the method of performing it at present young people choose their own trade or profession usually because at the moment of their choice it seems to afford a good opening a well informed person possessed of foresight might know that the particular line in question was going to be much less profitable a few years hence in such a case some public guidance to the young might prove extremely useful and as regards technical methods it is seldom in the public interest that an antiquated or wasteful technique should be allowed to persist when a more economical technique is known at present owning to the irrational character of the capitalist system the interest of the individual wage earner is very often opposed to the interest of the community since economical methods may cause him to lose his job this is due to the survival of capitalistic principles in a society which has grown so organic that it ought not to tolerate them it is obvious that in a well organized community it should be impossible for a large body of individuals to profit by preserving an inefficient technique it is clear that the use of the most efficient technique should be enforced and no wage earner should be allowed to suffer by its enforcement
5156221 there will be in the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude and producing dictatorship without tears so to speak producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them but will rather enjoy it because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods and this seems to be the final revolution

5156233 its just been maturing man just maturing and getting better and knowing what the priorities are
5156234 my priority is to play basketball and help my team get better thats what i am doing right now you have to establish a work habit youve got to establish some type of discipline and figure out a way to create your way in this game thats what i have been doing
5156235 it was the experience of being around guys who are more disciplined
5156236 seeing how hard work pays off thats been really the key seeing these veterans and what they do and why they are so good thats helped me tremendously tremendously that has helped establish me as a player and wanting to be great in this league
5156237 but you look past that because youve got a job to do and you have a life to live you have to make some money
5156238 the organization thought it was a great thing i did staying around and bettering myself to help our team next year defend a championship it was a good idea not only because i am working but because i am getting better as a person also
5156239 its not only great seeing the kids around boston but its great seeing them experience seeing a professional athlete live and in color

5156245 europe was shocked by the instability in the region and realised that hardly anyone would invest money in new projects associated with georgia
5156246 new opinions are always suspected and usually opposed without any other reason but because they are not already common
5156247 this report clearly shows there are alternatives to closing the emergency unit which can retain vital services locally without compromising on patient safety
5156248 it is important to emphasise no final decisions have been taken but this report will inform future work
5156249 to all intents and purposes nicola sturgeon has announced the closure of emergency facilities at the vale of leven hospital
5156250 her decision is a betrayal of patients doctors and staff
5156251 it means any patient who is not referred by a doctor to the vale of leven hospital will have to be treated at the royal alexandra infirmary in paisley
5156252 coming on the back of news that the birthing unit is to be saved i hope this marks a clean break from the lib lab pacts policy of allowing clyde services to wither on the vine
5156253 the board should waste no time in reversing its proposed cuts and ensuring that sufficient resources are put in place to guarantee top quality care at the vale for the long term
5156254 we dont want to have our granddaughter abused by these people

5156260 my advice to you is get married if you find a good wife youll be happy if not youll become a philosopher
5156261 it has therefore deliberately omitted a process of genuine consultation in order to spring this surprise and mask its ill will before the milf arroyo foists the moa ad on the filipino people as an instrument of political self perpetuation rather than as an agreement that will genuinely promote bangsamoro self autonomy
5156262 the unfolding events in mindanao are consciously being steered by the arroyo government she is mobilizing the countrys political and economic elite at the national and provincial levels to foment their deep seated anti moro chauvinism to justify the current military offensives and enforced displacement of over 150 000 moro and non moro people
5156263 the us has been forthright in admitting that it is involved in the peace process with the milf to rid mindanao of its self defined terrorists its strategic motive is to establish us foothold in oil natural gas mineral ore and agribusiness interests in the region
5156264 he was trying to find a politically correct way of telling me

5156269 i think the two kind of go together in my character i find that what is sensuous about her is the fact that she has daggers strapped around her thighs and swords on her back and shes wearing leather
5156270 so with michaels character of mathayus there is this underlying tension between the two because they were childhood friends and they havent seen each other for a good 10 years because hes been off training
5156271 she is fearless and she just wants to go and prove to herself that she can make something of herself which is something i can relate to
5156272 i now have a newfound respect for all those actors who do action films

5156395 we need to know how much alcohols actually being sold and consumed in the australian population we dont have good estimates of that at the moment
5156396 we do have survey data on what people tell us they drink we know that tends to underestimate consumption for a variety of reasons and probably accounts for about 60 per cent of the alcohol that we know is sold at best
5156397 the alcohol industry collect it themselves they pass it on to private market research companies
5156398 you can purchase the data for a very high fee 5 000 or 6 000 to buy data that the industry i think as a condition of being allowed to sell this product should be providing the government
5156399 i dont see why there should be a trade secret or it should be restricted to people with the capacity to pay those sort of amounts of money
5156400 but it certainly provides information that public health and other people can use to argue for changes as we have seen in new south wales for example some of the best recent data has been released by the bureau of crime statistics indicating rising rates of alcohol related assault
5156401 if we could link that sort of data to where the alcohol is being sold we would have a clear idea of what sort of products were contributing to that and we could then build a case for more restrictive policies or more targeted policies to attempt to reduce that harm
5156402 i think that changing the way that some people drink is much more important than counting and measuring the overall consumption of the community

5156404 tomorrow we should expect to see a high influx of gentrification with low pressure from the city to keep rents affordable if your rich dont worry about rain but for the rest of you keep the umbrellas ready because here comes a big one anticipate record breaking highs in rent increases for the rest of your life and dont expect any social climate change until your ready to do something about it
5156405 i have a piece of tissue that looks like a spinal disc a sand bag tough as nails on the outside and like sand on the inside
5156406 it will be something completely different from what ive ever done
5156407 im just putting it together at the moment but they will be very upscale dresses and likely will at around 1 200 retail im going to be using very expensive fabrics and finishes lots of embroideries
5156408 sports and me dont really go hand in hand other than with my husband
5156409 john edwards affair and his new baby mama say it aint so john
5156410 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5156411 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5156412 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5156413 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5156414 im so glad i didnt make you go it was insane amp you wouldnt have been able to stand it
5156415 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5156416 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5156417 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5156418 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5156419 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5156420 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5156421 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5156422 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5156423 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5156424 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5156425 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5156426 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5156427 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5156428 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5156429 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5156430 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5156431 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5156432 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5156433 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5156434 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5156435 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5156436 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5156437 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5156438 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5156439 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5156440 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5156441 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5156442 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5156443 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5156444 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5156445 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5156446 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5156447 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5156448 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5156449 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5156450 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5156451 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5156452 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5156453 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5156454 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5156455 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5156456 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5156457 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5156458 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5156459 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5156460 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5156461 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5156462 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5156463 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5156464 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5156465 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5156466 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5156467 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5156468 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5156469 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5156470 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5156471 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5156472 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5156473 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
5156474 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
5156475 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
5156476 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
5156477 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
5156478 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5156479 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5156480 i notice you are losing a lot of weight lately and i am getting worried
5156481 the role of central agencies is to collect information from various centres after an incident including details like modus operandi groups involved prime suspects motive source of finance probable escape routes and role of international agencies such as isi in the operation in time of such blasts the information base is handy in city blasts also we got some important leads about simi and its members
5156482 these blasts galvanized security and police agencies of various states and they were willing to share their information network and work as a cohesive team
5156483 safdar nagori was again interrogated after serial blasts in bangalore and ahmedabad in madhya pradesh jic that confirmed the involvement of simi and sim in the blasts we believe that more information will come out after the initial interrogation of the terrorists arrested by ahmedabad crime branch
5156484 i think im not much of a translator i simply find translating the best way to absorb world literature
5156485 im not trying to euphemize the fact that there is a lot of sex in the novel as many people did but it is by no means a pornographic book
5156486 readers and cultural authorities are so obsessed with sex that they tend to pay more attention to that element than to the tomes values
5156487 the world is flat a brief history of the twenty first century
5156488 there are a number of bands who are flying under the radar right now
5156489 band in boston is the opportunity to discover new previously unheard local music so head over to bandinbostonpodcast com for a preview of the week ahead as well as previously recorded performances of those taking part
5156490 its still long if i come back next year it will be shorter
5156491 oh yeah ill be there insert day event party here
5156492 hey im a terrible friend and ive either gotten drunk at home or decided someone else is more important than you at the last minute and wont be making it your event also even though ill say ill make to events in the future it would probably be best for you to not count on me
5156493 you spend half an hour washing the dishes and then four hours later you do it all over again and the same thing day after day and you just have to have faith that youre making a difference somewhere
5156494 ill meet the man im going to spend the rest of my life with
5156495 saya sudah jadi anggota dpr dua kali kalau partai mencalonkan lagi alhamdulillah kalau tidak ya nggak apa apa kalau saya ngotot ingin dicalonkan lagi kan nggak baik mengalir saja
5156496 saya ngomong apa adanya nggak minta perlindungan kalau saya dilindungi matur nuwun
5156497 cek diberikan di ruang emir muis melalui budi makmun murod anggota komisi xi waktu itu jumlahnya 10 lembar dalam travel cheque itu bergilir ngasihnya yang lain ada yang menyusul
5156498 extraordinary contempt and defiance beyond the usual call of engineering
5156499 da mi am imaginat de aceea ceream sa discut cu un organizator
5156500 nu aveti voie cu camere foto profesionale pentru ca asa zicem noi
5156501 javrelor leprelor canaliilor ordinarilor la streang cu voi sa ardeti in iad
5156502 dati mi si mie va rog fasia aia de muschi da aceea cat cantareste
5156503 cum facem sa determinam electoratul nascut inainte de 1989 sa relationeze cu noi ah stiu stegulete rosii si oameni entuziasti in fundal culoarea predominanta rosie iar el catindatul infatisat sub forma de tatuc protector in prim plan privind maret spre el potentialul elector gata facem va fi exact ca pe vremurile bune
5156504 l ai vazut pe figurantul ala cred ca incearca sa ma sape vrea sa ajunga personaj secundar stiu eu ca se culca cu regizorul incearca sa ma submineze si va reusi cariera mea de figurant este pe sfarsite o simt
5156505 si zi mi cum reusesti pozitia aia mi ai placut cand ai aparut intre cadrele 14490 si 14495 ai fost atat de natural in acele 195 de milisecunde
5156506 stop opreste rola da inapoi 23 de cadre nu 24 ca era acum mai putin de o secunda asa acolo da afla cum il cheama il vreau ca actor secundar in urmatorul meu film despre copii orfani ce traiesc crescuti de broaste testoase
5156507 uite o si pe vaca asta a copiat o pe britney leave britney aloooooooooooooone
5156508 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5156509 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5156510 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5156511 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5156512 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5156513 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5156514 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5156515 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5156516 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5156517 im now in tottenham but no one can disagree with me wanting to follow my dream
5156518 im not angry about the decision of juande ramos to name me as a substitute im not crying
5156519 i only show my emotions to my close friends and family but if i was laughing when i was on the bench people would say i was an idiot
5156520 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5156521 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5156522 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5156523 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5156524 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
5156525 we are a team with few stars but a strong will
5156526 because we play as a team we were able to keep our cool and even get better after going down a goal and down a man
5156527 first were like brothers out on the pitch all of us working for our mates
5156528 secondly we never stop attacking weve shown that we can attack so far at this tournament even after we conceded the first goal against italy we pressed forward all the time and took them out of their comfort zone
5156529 its not going to be easy for us but we managed to beat italy in the last game and we are growing in confidence nigeria may be good but we are a team not to be overlooked
5156530 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
5156531 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
5156532 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5156533 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5156534 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5156535 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
5156536 if you dont wear cowboy every day youre not used to yourself with the boots
5156537 we feel a big need to cater to the hispanics
5156538 were not going to get rich doing this but a lot of people will be helped
5156539 here in basalt and in aspen too not in the middle of the circle maybe but in the circle
5156540 to follow the rules and pay taxes and all of those things
5156541 theres just no other way theres no way to get a legal visa if they want to come get me they can come get me i know this is bad to say but if they take me to mexico i know ill be back here in two weeks
5156542 a commonly identified source of racism is not having enough experience with people from another walk of life
5156543 so when you can create events and circumstances where people can just rub shoulders and interact it can go a long way to create mutual understanding
5156544 its the best way we can say thanks to share our culture and learn about yours
5156545 the communication barrier is really what keeps people from interacting
5156546 if they dont speak english some see these people as just living in a mobile home trailer and they dont see them as hardworking people or as educated people
5156547 were not as concerned about it as we initially were
5156548 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5156549 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interests
5156550 we support georgias sovereignty we support its independence we support its territorial integrity we support its democracy and its democratically elected government
5156551 so basically what we have here but not with bush
5156552 we backed off and let the experts handle it they went through everything
5156553 multiple assault type weapons were found various handguns altered firearms and unlawful possession firearms ammunition for those weapons homemade incendiary devices and military type incendiary devices
5156554 i knew he had a lot of guns hes a hunter but the explosives i dont know nothing about that
5156555 i couldnt ask for more my husbands home with us everythings wonderful
5156556 the armed forces will not let them come home without the red cross stamp of approval
5156557 i left where i was stationed on the 10th but i didnt leave the country until the 11th and then i got home on the 12th
5156558 when he left for deployment i didnt know i was pregnant
5156559 he found out through text message that i was pregnant i tried calling him when i took the test but couldnt reach him i took a picture of the pregnancy test and texted it to him
5156560 he called me back and kept saying wow wow he was pretty excited weve been trying for years to get pregnant and were scared it wasnt possible for us
5156561 it wasnt the timing we expected but it definitely was the blessing we wanted
5156562 she had left a couple messages that she was in the hospital in labor then her sister called after and said the baby boy was fine
5156563 when i get back from afghanistan i plan on joining the mckeesport police force
5156564 we still feel theres a small group were not reaching

5156575 to the instant reaction of his co horts he says
5156576 instead of doing nothing in the summer this was doing something meaningful

5156578 a lot of these kids had never worked with tools before
5156579 some have never worked outside or been in the woods
5156580 my mom told me i was going to work and that i was going to do this she wanted me out of the house
5156581 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

5156583 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5156584 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5156585 the driver of a vehicle upon a divided highway with an unpaved space of at least 5 feet a raised median or physical barrier is not required to stop when traveling in the opposite direction of a school bus which is stopped in accordance with the provisions of this section

5156589 my internship took place at the washington bureau of al arabiya an arabic news channel based in dubai
5156590 i developed a lot of skills and confidence in setting up and carrying out interviews and doing editing for television
5156591 but because of the language difference i wasnt able to do a whole lot of the writing for the show
5156592 i went there not knowing much about the middle east and i came out knowing a lot more about the leaders and about the day to day situation there
5156593 often when people think about the arab world they think of it as a distant far away place that we have
5156594 at the news channel we spent the summer covering american news looking at everything that would affect the middle east and there was a lot
5156595 i worked with a lot of palestinians so that opened me up to a different perspective than the one that i was exposed to in the western world often we see only one side of things
5156596 the institute brought in journalists from the field that would talk to us about their experiences each week
5156597 it was an intense program we didnt have any free time
5156598 it was really encouraging because he told us that 10 years ago he was sitting in the same seat that we were now sitting in
5156599 getting public reaction for dont mess with the zohan the adam sandler movie that came out shortly after i arrived
5156600 because i was the only intern with camera experience they sent me out on the street to get comments from people so i stood outside a movie theatre to ask people about the portrayal of the israeli palestinian conflict we got a few different responses
5156601 the exercise brought to light the issues but mostly everyone thought it was just a stupid movie
5156602 it was a fun little thing that became my favourite assignment
5156603 i want to do backpack journalism i want to tell stories about people who dont get their stories told i hope that my travels will take me to africa

5156610 we dont have a mandate to share editorial were so local in our orientation its never made any sense to do it that way i think weve got six or seven film critics around the company now if you put your efficiency hat on could one film reviewer do the same job for everybody perhaps but that connection to film and the local community is something im proud of im more interested in trying something that really takes this talent and creates a national web site out of it
5156611 the fiscal realities that are facing everyone in the newspaper business
5156612 to reviewing and reporting on the local film scene and the many film festivals creative loafing has always covered in depth
5156613 i get to touch the ball i get to touch the ball

5156616 dan dia tidak menjadikan kesukaran dalam agama atas diri kalian
5156617 sesungguhnya allah swt tidak mengutusku untuk mempersulit atau memperberat melainkan sebagai seorang pengajar yang memudahkan
5156618 dia akan masuk surga kalau memang benar apa yang dikatakannya
5156619 sesungguhnya allah suka kalau keringanan keringanannya dimanfaatkan sebagaimana dia benci kalau kemaksiatan terhadap perintah perintahnya dilakukan
5156620 bukanlah termasuk kebajikan untuk berpuasa di dalam perjalanan yang jauh
5156621 sesungguhnya allah tidak membutuhkan tindakan penyiksaan diri sendiri seperti yang dilakukan oleh orang itu

5156625 we can see little flashpoints in gas prices or a spike in joblessness but getting the whole picture is extremely difficult in part because were depending on government collected data which could often be three months later
5156626 is it a housing story is it a gasoline prices story is it an inflation story
5156627 we need to create other listening posts than the treasury department and the bureau of labor statistics

5156631 tapi jika pecandu sudah bisa menetralisir racun dengan keladi tikus dia tidak boleh memakai narkoba lagi karena pasti akan timbul resistensi jadi jangan seperti kebo habis mandi berkubang lagi

5156643 the majority of voters 62 say congress has not passed any legislation to improve life in america
5156644 lobbies like to pretend that congressional action and their donations arent tied
5156645 they think it just affects rich landlords who ought to pay more anyway but we cant charge any more rent
5156646 at 850 a month rent its absolutely a negative for me nice rentals will disappear were going to have rentals in disrepair and foreclosure
5156647 those marion county homeowners who protested last year got their relief but there is no association of landlords or renters and we got pushed into the corner
5156648 it has the potential of putting some businesses out of business and government just keeps getting bigger
5156649 we have now reissued tenders slashing fees to rs 10 crore
5156650 we dont want to clutter streets with hoardings locations have been chosen meticulously and we have also put restrictions on installation in busy areas
5156651 ideally hoardings should be restricted to public utility places like a bus terminus near pay and use toilets and amc halls but we are forced to rely on them for revenue
5156652 according to the majority of energy experts and researchers hydrogen is currently impractical as an alternative to fossil based liquid fuels

5156660 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5156661 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5156662 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5156663 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5156664 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5156665 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5156666 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5156667 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5156668 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5156669 im now in tottenham but no one can disagree with me wanting to follow my dream
5156670 im not angry about the decision of juande ramos to name me as a substitute im not crying
5156671 i only show my emotions to my close friends and family
5156672 but if i was laughing when i was on the bench people would say i was an idiot
5156673 live action 3d is the future teach it well and let it lead the way
5156674 it will be as important as the transition from silent to sound or black and white to color
5156675 when youre doing something thats never been done you dont exactly know youre there yet
5156676 protection of landmark resources are essential to safeguard city and countrys historic aesthetic and cultural heritage
5156677 he was at his cellphone repairing shop in danilimda when we heard of the blasts on july 26 his only fault is that he attended a simi meeting in surat in 2001 and had been arrested then but he used to regularly report to police for all these seven years
5156678 whenever a terror attack takes place police interrogate him this time also he was taken to dariapur police station first and then to the crime branch office twice every time he was released but he hasnt returned since last friday
5156679 not only was the diabetes high it had led to eye complications of retinopathy and damaged the vision of the surgeon
5156680 over 50 per cent of diabetes cases are not diagnosed in the state of those which are 50 per cent are diagnosed accidentally when the patient gets fever goes for surgery
5156681 a huge percentage of my patients confess to being diagnosed with diabetes accidentally mostly it is prior to a surgery or medical check up for visa applications and employee medical examinations
5156682 not only were my two arteries blocked there was a very high per cent of glucose in my blood doctors said that the undiagnosed untreated exposure of high blood glucose many have accelerated the blockages of the heart arteries
5156683 nearly 70 per cent of my patients have been diagnosed with diabetes just by chance when they went for an orthopaedic surgery after an accident heart problem or even during pregnancies
5156684 if a person is above 35 with a family history of diabetes has a waist size more than 90 cm suffers hypertension he should go get a blood sugar test now this is important as any exposure to the high blood glucose causes damage to the organs
5156685 panchmahals police sometimes uses the same area as a firing range this is why even the people who stay nearby did not notice anything amiss while the camp was going on
5156686 near a dargah on the highway and around 40 km from vadodara
5156687 this region has many dargahs and other shrines all of which are now under surveillance
5156688 we are shocked by the claims of police about terror camps near pavagadh and we have serious doubts whether they were held here there is no role of the trust in the entire episode
5156689 sajid had worked as madarsa teacher in jaipur after he had slipped from the net of the gujarat police when a meeting of simi activists was being held in rajshree cinema hall in surat in 2001
5156690 after working in jaipur he had shifted to bharuch from where he was arrested recently
5156691 we hope to reveal the mystery behind the jaipur serial blasts within the next two days rajasthan police are coordinating with their counterparts in ahmedabad and we are working on definite leads
5156692 the sale of tamar represents a significant de risking for the bbp business
5156693 bbp has achieved a key step towards stabilisation of debt and balance sheet improvement
5156694 psi will need resources and funding to further commercialise the resin technology and this would have been detrimental to our eps earnings per share
5156695 the immediate cash injection coupled with zooms interest in joint project involvement will provide both an immediate financial boost plus broad operational and technical support to our green energy drive across three continents
5156696 quite apart from zoom we are now attracting growing attention from world class energy infrastructure and engineering majors in many parts of the world
5156697 increasing global political consumer and regulatory pressures arising out of climate change concerns are driving many governments as well as national and multinational companies to look for viable technologies which can provide early climate and emissions solutions
5156698 this push will help accelerate the pace at which edens technologies and projects are able to be rolled out we believe zoom will be a strong strategic partner with its broad affiliations particularly in india where eden is focusing its efforts to market hythane as an ultra low emission high efficiency fuel
5156699 a school is a factory is a poem is a prison is academia is boredom with flashes of panic
5156700 we are broadening our management skill set to manage the transition to delivering a range of value added broadband services
5156701 will likely also carry more risk than acknowledged by pbgcs analysis
5156702 any investment strategy that allocates significant portions of the portfolio to volatile or illiquid assets
5156703 the whole point of the new policy is to make it far less likely that congress will have to engineer a bailout
5156704 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5156705 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5156706 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5156707 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5156708 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5156709 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5156710 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5156711 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5156712 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5156713 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5156714 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5156715 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5156716 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5156717 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5156718 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5156719 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5156720 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5156721 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5156722 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5156723 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5156724 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5156725 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5156726 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5156727 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5156728 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5156729 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5156730 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5156731 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5156732 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5156733 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5156734 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5156735 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5156736 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5156737 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5156738 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5156739 the people evacuated were going to come back but the reports about renegade ossetian militia looting near the capital have spooked them
5156740 most of the other irish and passport holders have made their way back to ireland or gone on holiday
5156741 her cousin was killed and another cousin was badly injured when the russian attack helicopters bombed poti she hasnt been able to reach her father since the first bombs fell a week ago
5156742 we have appealed directly to the americans here and miche l martin to provide aid and basic medicine
5156743 poti is bombed back to the last decade gori is flattened and life in tbilisi remains okay all just as the economy was outperforming india it has now been blown to bits
5156744 i had to get the romanian guys evacuated last friday by crossing the border into armenia as they were passing a military airfield at marneuli near the border some russian mig planes just dropped in and bombed the runway they were only 300m from the explosions and did not get injured but they were very traumatised they are in romania now and do not want to come back
5156745 i will stay here and work from here until things settle down my only concern is if the locals take it out on the russian company
5156746 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5156747 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5156748 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5156749 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5156750 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5156751 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5156752 thats okay but i think it needs a little crack mmmm crack delicious
5156753 weve taken the first of what must be three steps to make the caps permanent and constitutional the legislature has voted once to submit this to a referendum of the people a second vote under our law must occur and then you the people get a chance to vote
5156754 im very confident that if the people of indiana get that chance they are going to vote to lock in these caps and this unique in america protection we have to make sure that that vote happens and that it comes soon
5156755 the state would collect only what it needs to provide essential services to protect itself against a downturn and to have an adequate reserve above that the money stays with the taxpayer to be spent on family needs and to be reinvested in a growing economy
5156756 optus is incredibly excited to launch this industry first product
5156757 we want a quiet life when were going out we want to keep to ourselves and dont want other people to intrude

5156763 jubber cooperated with israeli parties and collaborators who fled the palestinian territories in the establishment of projects worth millions of dollars in romania
5156764 president musharraf is not going to saudi arabia or any other country and he will fight impeachment constitutionally
5156765 neither is it that us foreign policy is cruel because american leaders are cruel its that our leaders are cruel because only those willing to be inordinately cruel and remorseless can hold positions of leadership in the foreign policy establishment it might as well be written into the job description people capable of expressing a full human measure of compassion and empathy toward faraway powerless strangers let alone american soldiers do not become president of the united states or vice president or secretary of state or national security adviser or secretary of the treasury nor do they want to
5156766 if one looks at the credentials of skeptics compared to the credentials of defenders of the official line it is impossible to dismiss skeptics as kooks
5156767 altemeyer prepared a digest of his research for general readers which he has posted online for one and all to examine at no cost
5156768 we believe in liberty and justice for all so of course we oppose many us government policies it means we believe in freedom as more than merely a cliche

5156775 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
5156776 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
5156777 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
5156778 is just astounding that one is going to stand for a long time i only see that one being broken if science finds some way to make a baby out of

5156781 at the moment were not suggesting genotyping for women with migraines with aura the consequences of having this gene are completely unclear right now

5156830 we havent officially heard about the plan from official israeli leaders all what sic we hear about are just media balloons to show that israel is serious in the peace process
5156831 these are half truths used by israelis as a test balloon so they can blame the palestinian authority should the negotiations fail
5156832 we are not a bazaar we want a complete israeli withdrawal from the territories it occupied in 1967 including jerusalem and agreement on all the final status questions
5156833 the israeli proposal is not acceptable the palestinian side will only accept a palestinian state with territorial continuity with holy jerusalem as its capital without settlements and with the june 4 1967 boundaries

5156840 theres some sweat and history in that number 4 we feel like it ours
5156841 we will also investigate internally how this incident took place and who was involved and make whatever decisions are necessary to ensure that this kind of situation never happens again
5156842 everybody that came in there got pretty torn up not only did it look spectacular but it actually was as bad as it looked it was just a crazy wreck as you all saw you were like holy cow that was at watkins glen you dont normally see something like that there im glad to get back on an oval this week better here than bristol at least for this week
5156843 ok david you can wreck once in a while but youve had your wreck for a while now lets focus on making sure we stay on the black stuff
5156844 we ran great today there were a couple of cars that were really fast tony stewart was real fast and brian vickers was extremely fast the changes my crew made were great and they made our car real fast for the final run and tony was having that trouble on pit road or whatever happened to him it was sure a lot easier to pass him there on pit road than it would have been on the race track we came out first our guys did a great job and it went green the rest of the way
5156845 theres no secret i love the big ovals thats where im comfortable thats where weve been the strongest we came here looking to run in the top 10 all day and we did that it was a flawless day for this clorox team

5156859 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared

5156870 where a special synod is organised and provision passed which would penalise any bishop coming to the lambeth conference
5156871 what are we saying about our leadership styles it was the same in nigeria many would have been glad to come so when they say 200 of our brothers have boycotted the conference definitely no maybe given the freedom one or two would have stayed behind it must be clearly understood the reason why they didnt come is that they were forced not to come

5156902 were ignorant of the reality of the amazon rainforest and should stick to trying to influence their own governments
5156903 we are aiming to buy about 1 000 acres about 400 hectares a year
5156904 we have all sorts of sources about what is coming up its a case of wow lets have that buying woods resonates with people woods are touchable there is a huge sense that government is not doing enough indeed is going in the wrong direction as far as conservation is concerned
5156905 it is too much to rely on governments to protect the land the only way to make conservation happen in time is to buy it from willing sellers
5156906 conservation has immeasurably worsened the lives of indigenous peoples throughout africa
5156907 life was healthy and good but we have become beggars thieves and prowlers
5156908 this disaster has been imposed on us by the creation of the national park
5156909 it is estimated that some one million square kilometres of forests savannah pasture and farmland in africa have been redefined since 1970 as protected or conservation areas yet in the great majority of these areas the rights of indigenous peoples to own control and manage these areas have been denied no one knows how many people have been displaced by these protected areas
5156910 that the seemingly perfect wild nature in which we had been climbing skiing and hiking for years was actually in big trouble private wildlands philanthropy mixed with political will can create wildlands preservation on a grand scale and swing the pendulum of extinction back on wavering species
5156911 we were clearly a little naive about the amount of political and non political opposition we would face
5156912 we should have tried to know more going in about the political culture were getting better at that

5156915 once you get big carbon money going to the worlds forests you get questions about who actually owns the trees

5156931 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5156932 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

5156934 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5156935 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5156936 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy

5156946 roberts the national endowment for democracy is a neoconservative organization funded by the united states government and its purpose is to buy and rig elections in the former constituent parts of the soviet empire it is the tool of the neoconservatives for establishing american puppet states in eastern europe in the caucuses and of course its money and election rigging was instrumental in what they call the rose revolution in georgia and of course they interfere in the ukraine and eastern europe the neoconservatives who have controlled the bush regime in washington their plan is to bring russia along with the entire middle east and iran under american hegemony so that whatever happens in the world is dictated from washington and so these puppet states such as georgia are part of the surrounding of russia with american military bases and american missile systems such as the one they are going to put up in poland they hope the czech republic and kosovo so this is all part of the expanding american empire the neoconservatives say the american empire is much more powerful than the roman one so the americans have the power to dominate the entire world that is what this is about

5156972 precisely how this happens is one of the challenging questions in strongly correlated electron systems
5156973 but even though we dont know the precise mechanism we are still able to make some general predictions about the behavior of pnictides and weve suggested a number of experiments that can test these predictions

5156987 that gives you an idea of the large potential of wastewater agriculture for both helping and hurting great numbers of urban consumers

5157009 we are the first manufacturer in the world to offer this type of feature as standard city safety clearly shows that the new volvo xc60 is the safest car volvo has ever produced the car is packed with our accumulated safety know how and technology both when it comes to preventing accidents and protecting all the occupants in a collision

5157022 the hindus were victims of religious persecution in pakistan and continued migrating to india for a better future
5157023 we have requested the central government to empower district magistrates to grant indian citizenship to these hindus rajasthan has also asked the centre to reduce the citizenship fees substantially which is currently very high
5157024 the fees is so high and not at all affordable for the displaced hindus
5157025 at that time the fees was rs 7 00 per application thereafter the government increased it to more than rs 10 000
5157026 most of the hindus coming from pakistan are dalits or tribal bheels living in impoverished conditions and are not able to even feed their family how can they arrange such amounts

5157132 a unique artistic achievement by one of ausrtalias promising young musicians tawadros combines the oud with piano clarinet bendir and req to create an astonishing and unique musical language that defies categorisation its not traditionally egyptian its not classical its not jazz you simply have to hear it
5157133 secular music reaches for the sacred when an underlying fervour is inverted into formality layered with mystery australias foremost oud player joseph tawadros achieves this with angel which announces his arrival as an exceptional composer not only has he shaped two extended suites angel suite in d and hand in hand suite in c into convincing wholes but every melody induces a wonderment partly a response to the sheer beauty and partly an eerie sense of prior familiarity that simultaneously creates disquiet and intense wellbeing tawadros has scored his pieces for piano matt mcmahon clarinet dimitri vouras and percussion james tawadros given the ouds penchant for a mid range register easily clouded by other instruments the piano often glazes the music with diaphanous treble notes and little glints of debussy shine through cracks in the use of egyptian scales rhythms and forms the playing and recording are as outstanding as the sad yearning compositions
5157134 the music of egyptian born australian based joseph tawadros traverses the boundaries of jazz classical and world music creating this seemingly effortless subdued fusion of genres and worlds the musicianship of both himself and his quartet is nothing short of breathtaking in which joseph tawadros oud snakes around matt mcmahons band of five names jazz piano dimitri vouras clarinet and younger brother james tawadros bedir percussion and req a small handheld tambourine this is the kind of exotic jazz that youd dream of stumbling across late one night in the middle east yet the reality is that youre probably more likely to see them closer to home in a concert hall this is his fifth album with all the pieces composed by tawadros however there is a fair degree of soloing as well as some conversational interplay between the instruments which in the main retain a dignified slightly subdued feel only occasionally building up in intensity its a really unique recording lush and vibrant with a very much live feel continuing tawadros desire to take the oud into new uncharted realms he does so here yet he does so with such confidence that it almost feels like he is merely carrying on a centuries old tradition

5157138 the love of god has been sanitized democratized and above all sentimentalized
5157139 necessary component to any mature and orthodox view of god and the world
5157140 in the sense that christs death was sufficient for all and that scripture portrays god as inviting commanding and desiring salvation for all
5157141 believes that the cross is the ground of the christians acceptance before god
5157142 requires the conclusion that the ultimate distinction between the believer and the unbeliever lies finally in human beings themselves
5157143 entails an understanding of grace quite different and in my view far more limited than the view that traces the ultimate distinction back to the purposes of god including his purposes in the cross
5157144 this doctrine does not make sense to the human mind but it is where an orthodox understanding of scripture takes us so we just need to rest in the mystery of god
5157145 the ultimate distinction between the believer and the unbeliever lies finally in human beings themselves

5157185 we are eager to see the variety of books that so many young readers will take the initiative to nominate
5157186 summer reading helps kids stay at the top of their academic game when school is out and we hope this award adds a little extra incentive to discover a good book
5157187 as an ethical requirement for organ donation the dead donor rule has required unnecessary and unsupportable revisions of the definition of death
5157188 the uncomfortable conclusion to be drawn from this literature is that although it may be perfectly ethical to remove vital organs for transplantation from patients who satisfy the diagnostic criteria of brain death the reason it is ethical cannot be that we are convinced they are really dead
5157189 although it may be ethical to remove vital organs from these patients we believe that the reason it is ethical cannot convincingly be that the donors are dead
5157190 in terms of valid informed consent under the limited conditions of devastating neurologic injury
5157191 vital organs which occur singly in the body can be removed only after death that is from the body of someone who is certainly dead

5157236 we are in a time of disassembly we are taking apart what we created in the industrial era and recreating it for the digital era i can only compare it to the invention of the printing press by gutenberg and the industrial revolution its important that journalists who are the protagonists of this deconstruction dont forget these rules and principles of journalism and its role in a democratic society

5157296 we have assumed that for the first 72 hours we should rely on no one but ourselves because thats how long it takes for help to come
5157297 weve had a fortunate two years but for all of us who were here the memories of 2004 and 2005 are still fresh

5157312 its probably easier to get drugs off fat charlie round the back of the bus station than it is to get medicines but there we are
5157313 the evidence is absolutely clear that the extent of the benefits and the numbers of patients involved as such that it isnt the right decision for the health service to make treatment available until patients as they inevitably will move into the moderate stage of the disease
5157314 i feel particularly angry on behalf of early onset patients because it feels like an insult and the younger you are the more insulting it is
5157315 a lot of people with early onset have got dependents both younger and older and theyre trying to hold down a job
5157316 it is a really nasty disease and i cannot imagine cancer patients being denied a drug like this in similar circumstances
5157317 if im not on the drug id find certain things difficult doing up buttons so you get a line of buttons in the shirt done up right can be a problem
5157318 in theory i should be that much worse but my wife has said that im better now than i was in the autumn

5157337 most fashion photography is done by gay people finding women sexy
5157338 which is sort of not sexy at all at least to a heterosexual man shes so retouched so airbrushed without any human response at all and well you dont really want to fuck a doll
5157339 it doesnt really interest me very much my work has nothing to do with that i just really like women and i like men and i like children and i like eating and i like doing everything its something real im for the individual human being not some plastic figure some gay guy thought out thats valid for something but its not my cup of tea
5157340 i have a mercedes i wear a rolex watch i have no problem with the selling of things
5157341 the world is so beautiful as it is theres so much going on which is sort of interesting its just so crazy so why do i have to put some retouching on it its just pointless to me
5157342 they are quite the most practical costume for the game and i dont think the wearers lose anything in looks

5157344 some mafioso upset at having to sit in traffic you know like road rage but with guns or quarreling mafia families no one dared ask
5157345 you just learned to be low key and not flashy
5157346 fashion is this elitist world thats full of gossip and backbiting and all those things are good for reality television
5157347 the law provides if the taxpayer is insolvent to the extent of the amount of debt a short sale would not be taxable income
5157348 even in collection cases where youre dealing with the irs if a taxpayer has a large sum in his or her 401 k which the irs cannot reach by law it is still included the irs revenue officer will suggest that the taxpayer borrow against their 401 k or withdraw from an ira to pay that debt
5157349 but if a homeowner were in foreclosure and a bank were looking for assets the bank would have no power to reach a 401 k or an ira in most states
5157350 yeah its cool that its about superman without the word superman being mentioned
5157351 i like the fact that this song shows supermans insecurities
5157352 what i meant was that he is not perfect no matter how bad we want him to be its just like you daddy i know that you dont have all the answers even though sometimes i pretend to think that you have all the answers and most of the times i dont really care if you have or dont have all the answers

5157354 our passing game has not been as consistent with him out
5157355 he definitely adds a spark and is a player we need back
5157356 each and every player knows whats going on and didnt take too much of it to heart
5157357 but as long as he shuts up and produces thats all that matters
5157358 chad being chad hes been loony and kooky since hes been here were much better if hes on our team
5157359 we worked hard every day but the result was as you see and its really hard to take
5157360 we have two rules be on time and hustle if weve got rules weve got rules and that applies to the manager too what the hell i dont think that has nothing to do with it
5157361 the big picture is that there are several dimensions in which games have effects
5157362 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5157363 certain types of video games can have beneficial effects improving gamers dexterity as well as their ability to problem solve attributes that have proven useful not only to students but to surgeons
5157364 were getting to the point i feel personally that we can win at any race track we go to
5157365 our pit crew has stepped up their game that was our weakness for a long time and the guys have repeatedly week after week worked harder and become better
5157366 every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us what we just have to keep doing is going out here and try to win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground

5157370 non violent struggle the approach to eradicate dictatorship set the stage for democracy
5157371 i thought maybe this is a solution for the vietnamese people so i dedicated my life to viet tan
5157372 between you and me this time i may go to jail
5157373 i entered vietnam illegally just because they told me i shouldnt
5157374 the state paper in vietnam said quan nguyen is a very dangerous man a terrorist so i challenged them
5157375 i told them the whole truth that im quan nguyen a u s citizen and a viet tan central committee member
5157376 the police investigator told me i can bring you to cambodia and just kill you
5157377 i look at my family every day and before i go to sleep at night this really helped
5157378 if people really need democracy you can fight for it and send a signal to the world
5157379 to pay the price for my beliefs it was worth it
5157380 six months in jail made me realize that i love you more than i knew i will be 10 times the husband i was before because i recognize i need that love and cant take it for granted
5157381 claims against the individual in his official capacity are the practical equivalent of claims against the foreign state
5157382 n ormally foreign sovereign immunity extends to individuals acting in their official capacities as officers of corporations considered foreign sovereigns
5157383 individuals acting in their official capacities are considered agenc ies or instrumentalit ies of a foreign state these same individuals however are not entitled to immunity under the fsia for acts that are not committed in an official capacity
5157384 we thus join the majority of courts which have similarly concluded that section 1603 b can fairly be read to include individuals sued in their official capacity
5157385 i f congress meant to include individuals acting in the official capacity in the scope of the fsia it would have done so in clear and unmistakable terms

5157390 esta generaci n de nuevos narradores se caracteriza por no sentir que la obra de gabriel garc a m rquez es un condicionamiento o una presi n nosotros leemos a gabo con la misma actitud que a los otros cl sicos de la literatura universal

5157393 lo mismo que ha significado siempre que eres adicto a contar historias y que te enamora el lenguaje
5157394 la historia de la literatura atraves ya muchos cambios tecnol gicos con sus respectivos anuncios apocal pticos cuando se invent la imprenta muchos creyeron que al excluir los manuscritos esta terminar a da ando el arte pero el quijote de la mancha es hijo de la imprenta
5157395 pero esa concepci n fue reemplazada por la del escritor haciendo ruido con los dedos

5157427 first there is a trend in prescription drug cost growth generally prices tend to increase because of price increases for existing drugs the growth in the average number of prescriptions per person and the introduction of new drugs
5157428 so they have adjusted their 2009 bids to reflect those higher than anticipated costs
5157429 in addition 97 percent of people in stand alone prescription drug plans will have access to a 2009 plan with equal or lower cost premiums than their 2008 plan
5157430 moreover many medicare beneficiaries will have access to a medicare advantage plan that offers lower prescription drug premiums than a stand alone plan
5157431 we are paying for better outcomes and we are getting higher quality and more value for the medicare dollar
5157432 and these results show that by working in collaboration with the physician groups on new and innovative ways to reimburse for high quality care we are on the right track to find a better way to pay physicians

5157520 ive not heard many positive words about the impact that art bullock has made on the city of ashland
5157521 first and foremost is the cost that he has foisted upon the taxpayers through frivolous lawsuits
5157522 when you sue the city youre suing the citizens and that money is no longer available for other purposes because it is used for legal defense
5157523 for a city thats as vibrant and as involved as ashland that creates a kind of a malaise at a time when we all need to be moving as quickly as we can
5157524 just as a citizen ought to have the right to seek redress against a government a government ought to be free from frivolous or unmeritorious claims which cost that government significant amounts of money

5157532 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5157533 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5157534 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5157535 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5157536 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5157537 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5157538 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5157539 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5157540 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5157541 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5157542 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5157543 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5157544 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5157545 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5157546 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5157547 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5157548 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5157549 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5157550 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5157551 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5157552 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5157553 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5157554 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5157555 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5157556 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5157557 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5157558 wow hss already gone commercial i cant wait to post this to the forums

5157561 nancy lees life with ringo was flamboyant and larger than life
5157562 it enabled her to capture a space in time in popular culture that few people were able to capture
5157563 she didnt make appointments with these people she was having dinner with them and going to clubs with them
5157564 i hadnt really planned on doing a book at all
5157565 a really dear friend of mine ken mansfield who was the head of the beatles apple records in america was working on
5157566 when his editor saw the photos of mine that ken used in his book he said you know in the last 30 years i think ive seen all the pictures and the variations of the pictures of harry nilsson and ringo whose are these
5157567 ken said oh those are nancy andrews and his editor said nancy andrews who was between ringos first and second wives maureen starkey and barbara bach within two weeks i had an editor and a publisher sitting in my studio here in nashville
5157568 everyone loves this picture because anyone who knows bob or doesnt know him knows that you never get him with a real smile
5157569 i try to either get them out or get in
5157570 you try to connect not force it if they wont let me in i try to see if theyll just be themselves for me
5157571 besides being a really cathartic passage for me it was just so hard to pick and pare it down as to what went in the show
5157572 this is from the ringo the 4th album the first cover i did for him
5157573 this one is of central park we were at the plaza when i shot this it was the snowstorm of 1977 and that was outside our window
5157574 it starts with the first time i went to england with him
5157575 the organizing principle of any society is for war the authority of the state over its people resides in its war powers
5157576 ive spent years singing mostly about love and lust and seduction but what was on my mind most these days was the precarious state of the world
5157577 the answer seemed to be to make a protest album but within three days it turned into a pro peace album
5157578 presenting the whole idea that yes we can create a world thats different
5157579 but where would i get these songs i dont write but i do have a knack for finding good songs
5157580 i went to my favorite songwriter in the whole world bob dylan
5157581 but when the soul people got into it it was not only a good message but you could dance to it
5157582 you have to walk through the house and sometimes out to the porch to get a cell phone signal
5157583 and being in the womens music movement ive been involved in a lot of civil rights nuclear free future equality and justice activities
5157584 listening to all this historical music ive been struck by references to the almighty or divine in secular music

5157588 at the outbreak of violence russia had tried to have the united nations security council issue a statement calling on georgia and south ossetia to immediately lay down weapons however washington was disinterested
5157589 the war in georgia is a war for the west
5157590 this is not about georgia any more it is about america its values
5157591 urgent event russian georgian war a challenge for the u s and the world
5157592 seem happy to work together to weaken the influence of the united states and its democratic allies
5157593 significant long term impact on relations between washington and moscow
5157594 so why dont you shut up oh and by the way send some more of your military advisors to georgia they are doing a sterling job and they look all funny down the night sight all green
5157595 this approach lets you develop a lot of things at once which is very handy
5157596 the beatles music and appeal stretches so far around the world we felt the web site needed to reflect this variety
5157597 a reader of my recent story on pixar announcing that its popular renderman pro server software would start to support
5157598 we can see little flashpoints in gas prices or a spike in joblessness but getting the whole picture is extremely difficult in part because were depending on government collected data which could often be three months later
5157599 is it a housing story is it a gasoline prices story is it an inflation story
5157600 we need to create other listening posts than the treasury department and the bureau of labor statistics
5157601 substantial mental impairment at the time which would enable him to be found guilty of manslaughter
5157602 the calls related apparently to the sexual activities of cathy podestas boyfriend steven bannister and included that it was believed he was hiv positive he said
5157603 in the interview the accused said his mother was extremely upset about the calls and the fact she may have contracted the disease
5157604 substantial mental impairment at the time which would enable him to be found guilty of manslaughter
5157605 treason counterfeiting piracies felonies committed on the high seas and offenses against the law of nations and no other crimes whatsoever
5157606 in times past when a community was threatened the sheriff and citizens would form a posse to ride out and meet the threat
5157607 our community and those around us are being threatened by homeland securitys experimental bio germ lab since our state and federal elected officials are not stepping up to protect our water our air and our livestock from this deadly disease lab landfill and incinerator its time to mount up and ride for life
5157608 it just wasnt right to ask it to jump on sunday hes better this morning and we will see how he is this evening
5157609 vaccination against rabies is essential to protect your pet yourself and others and is required by law
5157610 it is important for a pet owner to know that if your pet is not up to date with its rabies vaccinations and it has contact with a rabid or suspect rabid animal or if it bites or scratches someone the pet may be euthanized or quarantined for up to six months
5157611 a pet that is up to date with its vaccinations would only need to get a booster dose of vaccine within five days of the pets exposure to a known or suspect rabid animal

5157615 not music that sounds good coming out of a jukebox at a bar
5157616 i play a lot of final fantasy but its not in my top twenty games of all time
5157617 i allow my disbelief to be suspended so i can experience things
5157618 im going to be really happy if these records are hugely successful
5157619 but id also be happy if theyre total failures anything that will keep them from being a new spoon or okkervil river record
5157620 the amount of work you put into preparing this music and then have it turn out as enjoyable
5157621 if i didnt have to worry about what blogs all over the world were going to say about my new record it would have been done by now
5157622 i can confirm that the protest against denmark has been dismissed and that no penalties will be applied

5157630 little jamaica our country is blessed with some of the best if not the best talent you can find
5157631 were getting a pretty good taste of what its like to be at the bottom
5157632 when i was thinking about it i was getting ahead of myself
5157633 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5157634 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5157635 this is a planning took where all things are going
5157636 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5157637 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5157638 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5157639 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5157640 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5157641 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5157642 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5157643 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5157644 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets

5157648 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5157649 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5157650 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5157651 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

5157682 2 against 3 and was composed for solo piano and performed by one of the faculty members at cornish whose name right now escapes me
5157683 2 against 3 ends on a high note and the charisma of the musician only added to the beauty of the piece releasing his hands from the piano and slowly turning to look out into the audience to suggest the end of the piece
5157684 i heard a rumor you have a tumor hope you get better not later but sooner
5157685 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5157686 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
5157687 help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors
5157688 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5157689 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5157690 at the same time there are clients who take pride in asking these girls to give them a blow dry or getting a manicure or pedicure taken from them
5157691 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart
5157692 but i dont want to weaken myself with these thoughts
5157693 the peace of mind i have now i never had before i suffered much more mental anguish in my married life
5157694 i feel that her hands call me again and again
5157695 when i see them i want to be like them strong girls
5157696 i want to make a name for myself in this profession
5157697 im independent now i stand on my own two feet
5157698 i have a job i work i earn in fact im living on my own which isnt an easy thing to do for a woman in pakistan for a lone woman to survive
5157699 your secrets safe with me dont worry i wont tell anyone
5157700 well what if he doesnt what if i dont get a job there what if im not hearing him what if im left disappointed

5157703 was ihr dem geringsten meiner br der getan habt das habt ihr mir getan
5157704 dass wir uns nicht gr eren dingen gewidmet haben als unseren eigenen interessen
5157705 wir werden in die modernisierung unserer servicecenter investieren konkret hei t das wir werden kleinere standorte in gr ere wettbewerbsf hige standorte in deutschland berf hren

5157708 j dische firmen d rfen den volksempf nger nicht herstellen einzelteile hierzu nicht liefern und weder als gro h ndler einzelh ndler oder werksvertreter diese ger te verkaufen
5157709 in w rttemberg baden sind alle rundfunkh ndler die vom kauf des volksempf ngers als eines minderwertigen ger ts abgeraten hatten verwarnt worden unter androhung r cksichtsloser bestrafung im wiederholungsfalle
5157710 bedenklich ist die immer gr er werdende sucht die in deutscher sprache ausgehenden meldungen ausl ndischer rundfunksender abzuh ren das f hrt dazu dass auch auf dem lande und auch von weniger beg terten volksgenossen anstelle der einfachen billigen volksempf nger die teuren und leistungsf higen rundfunkger te bevorzugt werden mit denen auch die sendungen aus dem ausland gut abgeh rt werden k nnen
5157711 denke daran das abh ren ausl ndischer sender ist ein verbrechen gegen die nationale sicherheit unseres volkes
5157712 the fifty fifty calls go the way of the team thats creating the momentum
5157713 the tackles we were making were putting them behind the advantage line so we were going forward
5157714 when you get a situation like that the calls tend to favour the guys going forward and i think thats where we perhaps got a couple of calls
5157715 i just felt the tackle players were lying there but we will have to go back and see if we could have done something about it ourselves
5157716 die berliner mannschaft spielt besser und f hrt v llig verdient

5157719 ich freue mich riesig dass jetzt alles gekl rt ist der hsv hat sich stark um mich bem ht das ist ein gutes gef hl ich will in die champions league und sehe die m glichkeit dieses ziel mit hamburg zu erreichen
5157720 ich habe h ufig mit meinem kumpel ivica olic telefoniert der mir zu diesem wechsel geraten und mir immer wieder erz hlt hat wie wundersch n diese stadt ist
5157721 mladen ist ein spieler der in der offensive variabel einsetzbar und sehr torgef hrlich ist wir sind berzeugt dass er die qualit t der mannschaft steigern wird
5157722 sowohl in der bundesliga als auch in der nationalmannschaft unter beweis gestellt hat
5157723 ich gehe davon aus dass wir noch etwas unter dach und fach bringen werden
5157724 there is a place i want to go to but i dont know where there is someone i want to meet but i dont know who
5157725 its better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
5157726 it is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves
5157727 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5157728 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5157729 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5157730 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5157731 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5157732 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5157733 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5157734 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5157735 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5157736 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5157737 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5157738 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5157739 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5157740 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5157741 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5157742 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5157743 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5157744 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5157745 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5157746 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5157747 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5157748 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5157749 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5157750 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5157751 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5157752 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5157753 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5157754 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5157755 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5157756 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5157757 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5157758 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5157759 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5157760 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5157761 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5157762 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5157763 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5157764 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5157765 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5157766 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5157767 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5157768 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5157769 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5157770 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5157771 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5157772 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5157773 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5157774 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5157775 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5157776 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5157777 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5157778 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5157779 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5157780 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5157781 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5157782 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5157783 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5157784 le t l travail est en 2008 d fini de la mani re suivante dans le droit fran ais le t l travail est une forme dorganisation et ou de r alisation du travail utilisant les technologies de linformation dans le cadre dun contrat de travail et dans laquelle un travail qui aurait galement pu tre r alis dans les locaux de lemployeur est effectu hors de ces locaux de fa on r guli re

5157804 he still hesitated a couple of times and the rhythm was a little off for him
5157805 it was just a hesitation and he didnt need to he wasnt sure of the very first thing he wanted to do and ive got to get him to help himself with his gut feel he had the right decision at first but he just wanted it to be better and he didnt need to
5157806 this was a different defense a different scheme a different philosophy
5157807 they really came after us we made some great decisions with some throws because nobody panicked we knew we were hot and we were very decisive with those throws in hot situations
5157808 we were trying some new things in the red zone trying to take some shots trying out different personnel in certain situations like three or four receivers against the 3 4 defense
5157809 its time to try out a lot of things i wish we couldve gotten seven points but i was excited that were able to sustain drives thats the second week in a row weve been able to do it
5157810 the first couple of series we made some plays but we hurt ourselves here and there we learned from that you cant always perform the way we did the last couple of games
5157811 i was nervous last preseason i was a little star struck i went into this year confident and now im just going out and having fun and the offensive line is doing its job too

5157813 the 2004 athens olympic champion was aware of an injury pre race but decided to run anyway

5157815 its something where you can make a difference its not just what you can do but you can enable a lot of other people to make their changes
5157816 i really feel i can help a lot of people
5157817 some people come and they do habitat for humanity and they build houses but i dont think i would be very good
5157818 so i tried to do what im good at i was particularly interested in this university because they are still in trailers after hurricane katrina and i thought it could be something i do to help

5157859 it is rather normal and usual for actors and actresses to be dressed in costumes from different ethnic groups there is nothing special about it

5157898 est bien hablarle a la gente de esperanza y de cambio pero es necesario ofrecer ideas m s concretas y pragm ticas
5157899 en lugar de tantos discursos en grandes estadios tiene que dar respuestas breves a la gente sencilla sobre c mo mejorar sus vidas
5157900 todos deber an tranquilizarse un poco y recordar que mucha gente no toma su decisi n hasta bien metidos en agosto
5157901 en los que todo se va a decidir por dos o cuatro puntos
5157902 las encuestas no tienen gran importancia en los veranos electorales especialmente este a o en el que la verdadera historia de uno de los candidatos est todav a por contar
5157903 prefiero bailar as y si tengo que ir a la sentencia perjudicado por la lesi n que as sea
5157904 pada hari ini saya mohd saiful bukhari azlan dengan nama allah berikrar dan bersumpah diliwat datuk seri anwar ibrahim pada 26 jun 2008
5157905 jika saya berdusta atas pengakuan ini maka saya berdusta terhadap allah dan sanggup menerima azab laknat dan kutukan daripada allah hingga ke kiamat
5157906 saya bersumpah dengan nama allah di masjid wilayah persekutuan mengikut cara dituntut agama islam seperti dinasihatkan dan tunjuk ajar ulama serta mufti saya diliwat anwar ibrahim
5157907 angkat sumpah ini dibuat atas kerelaan saya sendiri bagi menegakkan kebenaran sebagai seorang yang beragama islam berbangsa melayu dan rakyat malaysia
5157908 saya juga amat memahami akibat bersumpah dengan nama allah ini di mana jika ia tidak benar dan ciptaan saya maka saya akan dilaknat dan ditimpa malapetaka serta bencana kepada diri saya keluarga serta keturunan saya selamanya oleh allah
5157909 ini jalan terbaik bagi mendapatkan keadilan di dunia akhirat dan mengembalikan maruah serta harga diri saya di mana kepada allah tempat saya mengadu
5157910 saya lakukannya kerana allah saya bersumpah dalam rumah allah yang mulia tadi saya telah diaibkan dan diliwat majikan saya anwar ibrahim
5157911 perkara ini dalam bidang kuasa mahkamah syariah dan saya sudah membawa perkara ini sebulan lalu pegawai mahkamah syariah cuba berjumpa dengannya mohd saiful tetapi polis tidak membenarkannya permainan apakah ini
5157912 saya sudah pergi ke mahkamah syariah jika kamu hendak ikut cara islam kamu pergi ke mahkamah syariah ini jelas sekali gimik politik kotor umno
5157913 malam sebelum pengumuman tarikh pilihan raya kecil parlimen permatang pauh oleh suruhanjaya pilihanraya spr dakwa sebelum penamaan calon angkat sumpah pulak ini tindakan terdesak
5157914 sedangkan mengikut sejarah islam saiditina aisyah pernah dituduh melakukan perbuatan kurang sopan namun rasulullah saw tidak pernah pula menyuruh isterinya itu bersumpah
5157915 kalau nak bersumpah juga janganlah sampai suruh allah laknatkan seluruh keturunan sampai bila bila saya berpendapat saiful patut tarik balik sumpah itu
5157916 saya menyeru kepada orang ramai supaya jangan mudah untuk membuat akuan bersumpah dalam apa perkara pun
5157917 biarlah mahkamah putuskan untuk seseorang itu membuat akuan bersumpah saya bimbang akan tiba laknat allah
5157918 apa yang membimbangkan kita ramai beranggapan apabila mengangkat sumpah mesti kena pegang al quran sedangkan ia bertentangan dengan ajaran islam
5157919 pegang pegang al quran ini sama seperti orang kristian bersumpah dengan memegang bible ini semua pengaruh yang tidak baik dan ditiru orang islam
5157920 anwar perlu pegang al quran junjung al quran bukan hanya secara mendakwa dalam syarahan kata bersumpah dan kata tidak bersalah dengan tuduhan liwat
5157921 kena sumpah betul betul dengan menyebut nama allah baru boleh terima
5157922 itu adalah satu cara saiful terangkan beliau tidak diliwat oleh anwar dia memang percaya yang dia nyatakan kebenaran tetapi orang tidak percaya jadi inilah caranya
5157923 perkara ini bukan boleh dapat saksi dan kena ada empat orang saksi yang perlu di bawa untuk membuktikannya tindakan bersumpah itu perlu disusuli dengan ujian dna dan perkara lain untuk membuktikan kebenaran dakwaan liwat
5157924 sumpah banyak kali pun tetapi kalau tiada bukti dan doktor dah sah tiada apa apa sumpah dia tak boleh dipakai
5157925 dulu saya yang menjaga mereka sekarang kita tawarkan khidmat itu sekali lagi insya allah akan menang dan akan pertahankan kerusi permatang pauh
5157926 mubahalah memerlukan kehadiran kedua dua pihak yang bertentangan berada dalam satu majlis seorang individu akan melafazkan sumpah yang antara kandungannya mesti atas nama allah dan menyatakan dia akan dilaknat jika tidak bercakap benar atau berada di pihak yang salah
5157927 ini diikuti seorang lagi pula bersumpah ini bermakna mereka saling bersumpah menyumpah
5157928 sumpah perlu dilakukan secara serius kerana implikasinya yang besar sama ada di dunia atau balasan akhirat
5157929 walaupun bersumpah adalah perkara serius ia tidak diguna pakai untuk membuktikan kes jenayah syariah kerana kemungkinan disalah guna
5157930 bayangkan masalah akan timbul jika kedua dua pihak bersumpah masyarakat akan keliru kerana tidak pasti pihak mana yang benar dalam sesuatu isu
5157931 sekiranya dia benar dia akan selamat tetapi jika dia berbohong lambat laun kelaknatan allah akan turun kepadanya dalam berbagai perkara yang tidak tergambar oleh dirinya sendiri
5157932 keberanian saiful melafazkan lafaz yang seperti itu menunjukkan samada dia meyakini apa yang dia dakwa ataupun dia tidak faham akan kesan terhadap lafaz berkenaan pada masa hadapan
5157933 bukan mudah seseorang melafazkan sumpah mubahalah itu melainkan dia dalam keadaan tidak siuman ataupun dia sedar apa yang diyakini itu benar
5157934 oleh kerana akan timbul kesangsian pihak yang di cabar dan untuk menghilangkan keraguan masyarakat maka pihak yang didakwa iaitu datuk seri anwar ibrahim hendaklah melafazkan sumpah bermubahalah dengan bentuk yang sama maka jadilah mubahalah yang mana kita akan lihat hukuman tuhan nanti

5157960 the pioneer goal is not to develop yourself your own opinion its goal is to accept the system to accept the opinion of all the rest of the people and not to try to think deeply about what is going on

5157968 although nowadays the youth live faster and are becoming more unfamiliar with traditional values they still deeply love and respect their parents
5157969 thats why many youngsters visit pagodas and present their parents with flowers on this day
5157970 the festival is no longer exclusively for buddhists but an occasion for everyone to express their love to their parents this cultural trait has not faded over time but become more and more diversified
5157971 oh the patriots cant go undefeated in this era and they wont
5157972 policeman who is not wearing his uniform does not have the authority to stop anyone
5157973 even then you should get his id first to confirm if he is a cop there is no harm in calling the relevant police station to verify if he is supposed to be on duty that day

5157995 the significance of wasc approval means other institutions are far more likely to recognized the program and employers as well

5157997 one of the obstacles for buddhists seeking certification as professional chaplains is the lack of accredited graduate training programs
5157998 the program here at uwest is important because it helps to solve this problem and encourage the professional development of buddhist chaplains
5157999 a two year on campus residency requirement is vital for chaplaincy training
5158000 since an indispensible part of being an effective chaplain is good interpersonal skills this residency requirement will allow uwest to evaluate and help students develop these skills

5158056 all we know is that they the skiers were out in backcountry which is like going into the wilderness anywhere things can happen and unfortunately it did out there
5158057 they were just three totally unrelated incidents that were most unfortunate accidents are sometimes unavoidable but we know we have done everything we can to prevent them
5158058 we have had minor avalanches in the resort here but we monitor them closely
5158059 anything that looks dangerous we either fence off or make fall but backcountry skiing is a different thing theres no one out there putting up signs or warning people of hazards people who go backcountry take it at their own risk
5158060 we had 15000 people here yesterday but if it was a dangerous sport there would be a lot more people injured and hurt in this place
5158061 we are extremely conscious of safety thats our number one priority with anyone who comes to the resort we prepare the resort and facilities above safety requirement

5158105 apples iphone 3g was just a couple of days old when reports began trickling onto the companys support forum from dissatisfied customers complaining about poor reception
5158106 the web has a particular architecture and it makes sense that if you are deploying a service or api on the web then it should take advantage of this architecture instead of fighting against it there are millions of deployed clients servers and intermediaries that support rest and it makes sense to be compatible with their expectations
5158107 apple would gain nothing from telegraphing its intentions and capabilities by releasing public conceptual products the company is being more than prudent by not displaying their unconstrained fantasies to competitors media investors or customers
5158108 i had to bag the one where i drop a knife through my foot
5158109 justin was pouring very large drinks and the mortons bartender was standing behind him going hmmm
5158110 nick punto was our waiter and he kept going can you believe how bad im doing hes just a really nice guy they all are and theyre all just such regular guys not stuck up athletes
5158111 meeting the players face to face is so nice this was seriously the highlight of my year
5158112 anything a guy like cuddy is behind you want to get behind the waiters carry the bulk of the load because we get to talking with people the whole night were not qualified to wait tables
5158113 we want the guests to have a mortons experience but theyre here to have fun and to see the twins
5158114 it was really easy we told em what to do and they took it over they were rock stars
5158115 came to the back and thanked the staff the dishwashers everyone they talked about that for a long time talk about a class act
5158116 its tough to do pictures and autographs and then they ask you wheres the food

5158118 they were skiing in the area when the brother who survived had gone around the side of the ice cornice inspector peter rooney of cooma police said
5158119 the 22 year old was on top of the ice cornice at that stage when his brother who was below noticed that it was unsafe and called out to him i presume he could see cracks or movement underneath he said
5158120 and as he attempted to move off the top of the cornice it collapsed underneath him
5158121 he was engulfed in the snow and ice as it swept him down the slope
5158122 sadly ians son tom was killed in an avalanche in the snowy mountains on sunday afternoon the message says
5158123 the rooms will be closed for a few days but please keep in touch and think of ian
5158124 im led to believe that they were quite experienced i wouldnt go there if i wasnt a good skier he said
5158125 ms mckay was the first to be killed he told the court
5158126 there was tape wrapped all the way around her head
5158127 a bit of wire made like a noose wrapped around his neck and kim snibson stood on his back and pulled it up lea caton told the court
5158128 he has a pretty good shot at tying it up just looking at potential risk factor i could much more easily envision or imagine hamilton tying it up than the alternatives based on all the stuff there we chose to walk him even though byrd was 2 for 3 with an extra base hit recently against wheels i just wanted to go that way i didnt want to see hamilton there i mean listen its his year and why not have him hit a grand slam right there and really screw up ours
5158129 it makes sense hes a mvp candidate its a righty versus a lefty and a guy theyre scared of i can only win the game with a home run it was the right move to make i had two pitches to hit and i didnt get the job done
5158130 disappointment would be not making it to the final not making it out of the heats thats just ridiculous
5158131 i couldnt really get out of my bed until two days ago it was just a lack of energy my body was just completely fatigued it hurt to touch it hurt to lay down it hurt to do everything
5158132 i thought i was over it but it seems like it still has taken a lot out of my body
5158133 i got to one slow constant speed couldnt pick it up from there
5158134 ill get over it and access what i want to do and get on with the next race theres a lot of good people that arent going to make the finals or dont get out of the heats it happens to a select few it just happens this year that im one of them

5158143 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5158144 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5158145 that fraud has increased and appraisal fraud has increased in a way to exacerbate the problems
5158146 the higher the loan amount the more money brokers and lenders make in the deal
5158147 and they threaten you they say if you dont play ball with us well go somewhere else and they do ive seen my business shrink theyre all doing it its hard to stay honest
5158148 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5158149 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5158150 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5158151 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5158152 either you shut it off completely in a state or you just send letters
5158153 the threat of the atomic bomb is the only thing
5158154 they know they can keep doing what theyre doing because they can get away with it
5158155 theyre not getting punished and states arent doing more because they know regulators wont do a thing
5158156 i wasnt alone we had appraisers from all over the nation writing in and urging them to take action
5158157 resulting from inappropriate pressure being placed on real estate property appraisers to hit a certain value
5158158 people who say we should have done more dont understand how the system works
5158159 agencies just dont lobby to change things we had no interest in doing anything like that it just wasnt our area
5158160 good position to work with bank regulators and others on the problem
5158161 everything related to the issue went into a black hole why i just dont know
5158162 i tried to push but nobody wanted to hear what i was saying
5158163 problem appraisals are being allowed and in some ways even encouraged by a regulatory structure that promotes lax enforcement and ineffective oversight
5158164 we are here to alert congress that the licensing system it created for appraisers is broken and needs to be fixed
5158165 but states dont have the money to hire personnel to carry out what the system was designed to do
5158166 may have been rude or said my house wasnt worth as much as i thought
5158167 just because youre disciplined that doesnt make you a bad appraiser
5158168 i may have done some technical things wrong but ive done a good job im proud of my work
5158169 why should he get super zapped for doing a lot of little things that a lot of other appraisers are doing every day but havent had complaints turned in on them
5158170 it is significant that her personal doctor was also allowed to see her

5158203 from georgian sources and reporters based in georgian controlled territory the story of a relentlessly vicious russian attack against an isolated government emerged
5158204 only to be matched by a story emerging on the other side of the front line of a steady campaign against a barbaric genocidal regime hoping to quietly get away with ethnic cleansing during the worlds sporting holiday
5158205 widespread physical destruction with artillery shells tanks and guns of thousands of russian citizens basically an ethnic cleansing operation was carried out
5158206 but the russian propaganda machine is clearly working very hard right now
5158207 some may read this article and call it a conspiracy theory
5158208 yes there is a conspiracy its a conspiracy by the neocons with the aim of retaining their control over the worlds leading country and carrying out their plan to establish global hegemony
5158209 was it russian peacekeepers russian forces or the georgian army

5158223 if there was no political vacuum we would not have seen this huge response the vacuum is there in society and politics people always look for change
5158224 thirty years ago when i entered the film world there were many stars if i had thought there are already so many actors i would not have been here
5158225 i have no rivals in politics my fight is with poverty and hunger
5158226 it is a memorable day in my life after spending 30 years in cine field i have decided to enter politics in response to the call from all sections of people from here onwards i am dedicating my life to serve people
5158227 i am donning a new role i cant act in this role in this new role i have to live for others and this gives a satisfaction to me
5158228 when people come to me and tell me how the blood from the blood bank saved the life of their son or father i get immense satisfaction i go back to the house and share this with my family
5158229 i dont know politics just as i dont know how many blood groups are there i dont know the composition of blood but i know it can save life and i also know i can serve people by entering into politics
5158230 i consider it as a blessing from god i am fortunate to get this opportunity a few have got this opportunity i take it as my responsibility my dharma
5158231 i am not into politics for the sake of posts or power but for the satisfaction and peace of mind god has given me popularity and money it cant tempt me
5158232 hence my first public meeting is being organised on august 26 her birth anniversary i will speak how her life inspired me and what i want to do
5158233 a home guard in khammam district and an it couple in hyderabad ended their lives due to personal problems but wrote in their suicide notes that chiranjeevi should enter into politics to bring a change they reminded me of my responsibility
5158234 abdul kalam told me that people like you should come into politics people are looking at you not just as an actor but beyond an actor you should come into politics it will be wrong on part of good people if they dont come into politics after this i felt that it would be a historic blunder if i dont enter into politics
5158235 politics will be my priority but i am not closing the door on acting if a serious and educative film comes my way and it can serve society i will definitely do it
5158236 has gradually morphed from being about the humanity of the guard to being about the christian faith of the guard and john mccain
5158237 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5158238 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5158239 t he practice of arbitrary imprisonments have been in all ages the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny

5158248 manufacturing output growth will slow to 7 2 per cent pulling industrial gdp growth down to 7 5 per cent a full one percentage point below that of last year and 3 5 percentage points less than that recorded in 2006 07 services sector growth is also expected to slow slightly to 9 6 per cent down from 10 8 per cent last year
5158249 the increase in the oil import bill is bound to widen the current account deficit cad in the balance of payments the pressure on the fiscal system will intensify on account of key subsidy elements equity and other asset markets have already taken a big beating overall economic growth will slow down
5158250 there are serious fiscal risks arising from growing off budget liabilities on account of fertiliser food and oil along with unbudgeted liabilities arising out of the farm loan waiver and nrega schemes and the implementation of the sixth central pay commission these liabilities could amount to 5 per cent of the gdp in 2008 09 over and above the budgeted central fiscal deficit of 2 5 per cent
5158251 the value of crude oil and product imports would rise by 80 per cent to 138 2 billion while the value of product exports would rise similarly to 47 1 billion the projected value of merchandise exports and imports is 208 and 342 billion respectively leaving a bop merchandise trade deficit of 134 billion equivalent to 10 4 per cent of gdp a sizeable increase from 7 7 and 7 1 per cent in the last two years
5158252 the current account deficit cad is likely to expand to 41 5 billion equivalent to 3 2 per cent of gdp a major increase from 1 5 per cent of gdp
5158253 the persisting revenue deficit would remain a matter of concern

5158262 de banken waren bijna allemaal te snel om al het einde van de kredietcrisis in te luiden
5158263 de crisis zal pas eindigen wanneer de prijs van aandelen zich stabiliseert en niet eerder ik zie dat dit jaar niet meer gebeuren waarschijnlijk zal de crisis pas ergens tussen volgend jaar en 2010 tot een einde komen
5158264 het hangt van het gedrag van de consumenten af of de verenigde staten en europa in een recessie zullen belanden
5158265 gelijktijdig bestaat echter het gevaar dat een mogelijke recessie de conjunctuur in groeilanden zoals china en india sterk zal belemmeren
5158266 veel hangt af van de conjunctuur en de evolutie van de recessie in de verenigde staten heerst er op dit moment een misplaatst optimisme ik vrees dat het einde van de problemen nog niet in zicht is
5158267 het kan de aandelenkoers van de bank benadelen meestal zijn bankiers terughoudender mogelijk dat chammah wat rust wil cre ren want eerder is men ook al uitgegaan van een nog latere datum dan 2010 als einde van de crisis

5158305 i am certainly shocked and disturbed by the revelation that the firm was retained by both the developer and the city council what happens is that when you have a lobbyist try to negotiate that bill you wonder whether theyre lobbying in the best interests of the city or in the best interests of the developer

5158308 before social matchbox there wasnt really a good place for start ups to come together and announce to the community hi were here

5158310 could hire a staffing agency and that staffing agency will search monster com

5158316 oh youre only going because your parents are helping you out while youre in school
5158317 look pay attention youre forgetting something hey theres a whole world out there what the fuck are you doing
5158318 in a period after weight loss usually about six months the weight starts going back up
5158319 your metabolism slows down because its trying to conserve energy
5158320 so you get hungry your body doesnt expend as many calories as before doing the same things and you have to reduce calories even more
5158321 its tougher to lose weight and keep weight off now than it was 20 years ago because there are so many incentives to eat more and move less
5158322 if life gets in the way a spouse gets ill your child is going through behavioral problems the disposable energy that you have for any project including weight control gets diverted
5158323 there are very few people who can lose weight and keep it off without changing the amount of energy they expend
5158324 they weigh themselves a lot and they record what they eat on a regular basis
5158325 this doesnt mean you get crazy about every pound you go up or down
5158326 but it does mean that this is a chronic problem and when you gain weight what are you going to do about it the way you reverse small weight gains is to have a specific plan
5158327 i still believe that reducing dietary fat is the most efficient way of reducing calories
5158328 they have sort of drummed the cheeseburger out of their minds
5158329 they eat breakfast so theyre spreading out their calories over the day
5158330 you have to eat breakfast you have to spread your calories out and eat at least three or four times a day
5158331 we know that frequent contact with a health provider or some other entity thats looking after them that would include a support group is helpful
5158332 we find in our clinic sessions that people who attend the most sessions lose the most weight
5158333 unfortunately we dont know cause and effect if you force people to go to sessions would you get the same effect maybe people who are successful are proud so they show up
5158334 my sense is that in an attempt to find out what works we generalize too much some people are solo dieters and some like buddies the most consistent data show that consistent contact with a professional improves the long term outcome
5158335 people who carry guns in their car are more likely to have road rage
5158336 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5158337 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5158338 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5158339 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5158340 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5158341 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5158342 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5158343 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5158344 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5158345 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5158346 we are deeply disappointed by the verdict and we believe there are substantial grounds for an appeal which we intend to pursue vigorously
5158347 the government has basically never publicly reviewed whether the conflict of interests rules work they dont
5158348 its one of these cases that does go right to the heart of the procurement process
5158349 we maintain that our work for the nrc was free of even the potential for a conflict of interest
5158350 our work for other customers was entirely independent of the possible nrc standards at issue in the case as it was performed in support of the department of energy a federal department that is autonomous self regulating and separate from the nrc
5158351 radiological assessments of clearance of equipment and materials from nuclear facilities
5158352 detailed and broad based technical assistance on the subject matter of the release and reuse recycle of material and equipment from nuclear facilities
5158353 saic was looking at ways of taking advantage of these opportunities
5158354 saic was interested in pursuing the billions of dollars worth of business that would result from doe and other commercial nuclear facilities performing decontamination and decommissioning of their facilities
5158355 saic did not disclose this as an organizational conflict of interest relationship
5158356 if saic has an oci relationship to disclose it is not enough to simply bury it in the text of a technical proposal if there is an oci relationship it is not nrcs obligation to find it
5158357 according to islam an individual seeking justice should be respected even though it may be a personal issue
5158358 there are those who question his method and whether he is following the right procedure but in his heart he must have a clear intention
5158359 the incident must have been traumatic otherwise he would not have lodged the police report
5158360 it is just by coincidence that i made the oath today god gave me the strength to do it
5158361 it is normal for christians to swear on the holy bible and it seems that he wanted to follow the christian way of doing it

5158369 i wonder just how fast it will take me to eventually open up this physical cclap headquarters that i so pine for
5158370 how can i start making more money by any fucking means necessary goddamnit
5158371 please pluck this money out of my pocket in exchange for a warm safe voice of authority and respect telling me that im an okay human being in exchange for a sense of well being from the world at general for wearing a certain designer or staying at a certain hotel or having a martini at a certain bar
5158372 im looking to do a little skiing and have a little companionship
5158373 how amazingly great would it be to open a service oriented rare book service in a space like this that just happens to double as cclaps official public space
5158374 how great would it be to design and decorate this front room in the style of some old fashioned dark smoky victorian age private library how wonderful to walk into my space and suddenly be surrounded by oak by divans by rare and exquisite and plain wonderful books in every corner climbing up 20 feet from literally the floor to ceiling with chairs and a table and a tea set and a humidor in the middle literally transporting you into a different era of history every time you walk into the store so that when youre my customer and you come visit me no matter what your level of financial commitment each of your visits is hailed as a singular event with you being ushered into this private victorian chamber in uptown with coffee and brandy and cigars and pot or whatever you want all ready and waiting for you ready for a whole afternoon of lounging around leather chairs and looking at cool old books and chugging down cups of gourmet coffee
5158375 i think its imperative that the following step be taken the president should have already and should do so very quickly convene the presidents working group on financial markets thats something that he can ask the secretary of the treasury to do this has to be coordinated across markets with the regulators here and obviously with regulators and central banks around the world
5158376 t he banking problems in the united states continue to mount while the federal governments deficit continues to soar out of control so what happened to cause the dollar to rally over the past three weeks in a word
5158377 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars
5158378 on july 16 2008 the federal reserve reported holding 2 349 billion of us government paper in custody for central banks in its report released today this amount had grown over the past three weeks to 2 401 billion a 38 4 annual rate of growth so central banks were accumulating dollars over the past three weeks at a rate far above what one would expect as a result of the us trade deficit the logical conclusion is that they were intervening in currency markets they were buying dollars for the purpose of propping it up to keep the dollar from falling off the edge of the cliff and doing so ignited a short covering rally which is not too difficult to do given the leverage employed in the markets these days by hedge funds and others
5158379 theres a crisis in the white house and to save the election theyd have to fake a war
5158380 what happened on the night of aug 7 is beyond comprehension the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity the georgian leadership could do this only with the perceived support and encouragement of a much more powerful force
5158381 the u s has long been involved in supporting freedom movements throughout this region that have been attempting to replace russian influence with u s corporate control the cia national endowment for democracy and freedom house includes zbigniew brzezinski former cia director james woolsey and obama foreign policy adviser anthony lake have been key funders and supporters of placing politicians in power throughout central asia that would play ball with our side none of this is about the good guys versus the bad guys it is power bloc politics big money is at stake b oth parties republican and democrat share a bi partisan history and agenda of advancing corporate interests in this part of the world obamas advisers just like mccains one of his top advisers was recently a lobbyist for the current government in georgia are thick in this stew
5158382 washingtons bloody fingerprints are all over the invasion of south ossetia georgia president mikhail saakashvili would never dream of launching a massive military attack unless he got explicit orders from his bosses at 1600 pennsylvania ave after all saakashvili owes his entire political career to american power brokers and us intelligence agencies if he disobeyed them hed be gone in a fortnight besides an operation like this takes months of planning and logistical support especially if its perfectly timed to coincide with the beginning of the olympic games another petty neocon touch that means pentagon planners must have been working hand in hand with georgian generals for months in advance nothing was left to chance

5158385 under the city charter the city attorney the city secretary and the city managers jobs run concurrent in terms of tenure and appointments they are three year tenured appointments and they run with the mayors election
5158386 a record vote must be recorded on the proposed tax rate along with the governing body scheduling two public hearings on the proposal
5158387 we are putting the candidates for this very important position under the microscope today we deliberated further on the merits of each candidate but decided that wed like to speak to them one more time before making our decisions
5158388 background checks are not yet complete furthermore i have not had a chance to personally interview these candidates thanks to hurricane dolly as a commission we want to ask some tough questions on wednesday so we can select the most honest knowledgeable capable and hardworking elections administrator hidalgo county deserves
5158389 voters will be picking who they want for whats arguably the most powerful position in the world whoever we choose for elections administrator will have a learning curve and this is not a slight to them but we simply want the november election to go off without a hitch we are requesting help to administer this election
5158390 hurricane dolly battered south texas in a matter of hours but the impact of the storm will continue to be felt by texans as they work to put their lives and communities back together
5158391 this funding will help in the recovery process by assisting workers who were displaced by the storm
5158392 we work with school nurses to identify children who are having difficulty seeing the board and come from low income families the lions club then refers them to dr ahlman who provides a comprehensive eye exam and eyeglasses if required
5158393 i started my practice in edinburg in 1968 i got involved with the lions club that same year we have helped more than 100 kids each year it has been great to help so many children
5158394 without dr ahlman providing these services thousands of kids would not be able to see well and would be unable to do their best at school
5158395 we truly appreciate all that he gives to the children of edinburg
5158396 on behalf of the board i would like to express our sincere appreciation to the many individuals who worked so diligently to find a compromise outcome that would satisfy the responsibilities of both ut brownsville texas southmost college and the u s department of homeland security related to the construction of the proposed border fence
5158397 the boards approval of this budget reflects the systems continuing commitment to outstanding education research and health care
5158398 we have done our best to ensure that all system institutions do their work in an efficient and cost effective manner we believe the budget will accrue to the benefit of all texans
5158399 overall south texas fortunately escaped the widespread catastrophic impact a hurricane can bring to a coastal area
5158400 while some businesses in the region did experience significant damage the economic outlook for the south texas region as a whole remains excellent
5158401 south texas strengths include vibrant international trade a young and rapidly growing population and impressive gains in education and work force development
5158402 the regions rate of job growth will outpace that of the state through 2012 and south texas has a young work force to grasp those opportunities
5158403 how south texas meets the opportunities and challenges ahead will determine the magnitude of continued economic growth
5158404 we hope local government officials chambers of commerce economic development corporations and many others will use this report as a tool to stay on top of important issues as they work to keep their local economies thriving
5158405 one role of state government is to create an environment in which a healthy economy can flourish
5158406 nearly as many hispanics get health information from television as from doctors and medical professionals
5158407 whats more hispanics who dont have a usual health care provider are more likely to get health information from television than they are from medical professionals
5158408 when it comes to meeting the health needs of hispanics in america one size does not fit all
5158409 national and community health experts need to factor in differences between sub groups such as language spoken assimilation and country of origin and develop innovative solutions that meet the diverse needs of the latino community
5158410 it cant be a good sign for the full national team if our young guys cant make it far in the olympics
5158411 how wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world
5158412 to unite the various roleplayers in a public show of solidarity and commitment
5158413 there will be no handing over of petitions rather representatives of the various roleplayers will publicly sign a pledge in which they commit themselves to report crime to be involved in combating crime in their areas through for example community policing forums and neighbourhood watch to support the building of a values driven society and to support the creation of an effective integrated justice system
5158414 background perccis coordinated response to crime levels of crime in the nelson mandela bay area particularly contact crimes and crimes targeting business are on the increase high levels of crime increase the costs of doing business and are a negative factor in investment decisions for the area as well as influencing the flight of skills and capital it is widely acknowledged that unemployment and poverty along with a lack of shared values in our society are factors influencing the rise in crime a number of organisations have developed strategies and plans to deal with various aspects of crime but in many cases these initiatives take place in isolation the port elizabeth regional chamber of commerce amp industry percci working in partnership with roleplayers in business government and civil society aims to develop a coordinated response to crime and to strengthen existing initiatives by facilitating linkages between roleplayers job creation skills development and the building of a values driven society are long term interventions required in the fight against crime however the capacity to realise these is limited in turn by the problem of crime itself as an organization aiming to facilitate economic growth perccis approach to this project is to focus on solutions to the problem rather than contributing to negativity and pessimism a sustainable solution is required that addresses both the root causes and the immediate impact of crime a key driver in the fight against crime is the need for individuals to realise that crime is not someone elses problem all citizens and businesses need to take responsibility and play their part in developing a zero tolerance approach to crime the campaign will be launched through a public statement of zero tolerance for crime in the form of a march to be held on saturday 30 august rather than being a march against any organisation the event is intended to unite the various roleplayers in a public show of solidarity and commitment there will be no handing over of petitions rather representatives of the various roleplayers will publicly sign a pledge in which they commit themselves to report crime to be involved in combating crime in their areas through for example community policing forums and neighbourhood watch to support the building of a values driven society and to support the creation of an effective integrated justice system the roleplayers to sign the pledge will be representatives of local government business the president of percci the justice cluster and saps civil society and religious leaders the event has been planned for a saturday morning so as to minimise disruption of commercial and industrial activities sustainable campaign percci will be supporting various initiatives of bac in taking the fight against crime forward the chamber will also be working with the provincial safety amp iaison department to discuss their priorities and identify areas where business can play a role in supporting their activities percci has also initiated interaction with religious leaders and organisations working for values transformation and moral regeneration with a view to identifying how business can play a role in these areas information is a critical tool in empowering people to take action and percci will be collating and publishing relevant information eg crime fighting initiatives community policing forum details etc in conjunction with the local media including online media percci will use its communication channels and media contacts to communicate success stories and solutions percci is working closely with business against crime bac in developing a coordinated sustainable response to crime the chamber has also consulted and elicited support from the provincial safety amp liaison mec and his department the departments of justice and correctional services political leadership religious leaders and civil society groupings
5158415 with the western region of the eastern cape experiencing a relatively dry winter season up to now no significant downpours have been registered in the catchments of nelson mandela bays main water supply dams these dams are currently on average 85 9 full compared to 99 1 at the same time last year the kougha dam is 89 4 full compared to 99 4 at this time last year the churchill dam is 70 1 full 99 with the mpofu dam on 89 8 100 and the groendal dam on 67 8 90 5 although there is no reason for concern at the moment consumers are reminded of the severe drought related water restrictions that were in place from march 2006 to august 2006 these restrictions were lifted after the heavy downpours of that august month the water consumption in nelson mandela bay has increased by approximately 10 from 223 megalitres per day at this time last year to around 267 megalitres a day currently this should serve as motivation for all consumers to always use water sparingly to ensure that the water level does not drop too quickly
5158416 while i am very pleased to hear that action is being taken to address the taxi problem in the vicinity of the sunridge village i find it worrying that taxi drivers without pdps or drivers licences are issued a summons and allowed to go on their way surely they should not be allowed to drive any further once this has been discovered by a traffic officer i would appreciate your comments
5158417 i am most perturbed to hear from a number of the residents who objected to the development on erven 60 61 2073 and 2074 in westering by pieter rademeyer that they have never received a letter informing them of the decision by the mayor to allow the development and more importantly of their right to appeal against this decision i am aware that mr rademeyer is currently having plans drawn up for the development it is therefore imperative that urgent action is taken to correct the omission and to ensure that objectors to this development enjoy their right to administrative justice i would appreciate your comments on the matter
5158418 i just had a long chat with mrs cousins of summerville ave she said that theyve picked up 156 black bags across the road from her house that day you arranged for cleansing dept to pick it up she just wanted to thank you again and said that you must pop around sometime to see how beautiful the area looks now wally i presume it was wally van blerk visited her and he was apparently horrified with all the rubbish the people threw in the river he arranged for the branches of the milkwood trees to be cut down and now she can see the whole area she said she made it common knowledge to all the neighbours etc that she knows now who to contact and that she will report whoever dumps again and that they will receive a fine according to her there were just some builders rubble left which they were going to clear today she will keep us informed
5158419 omg what did you say theyve taken the video down big brother is silencing free speech
5158420 wow a lot of people tell lies a lot of the time
5158421 a perfect storm would be if this got out of control the economic backlash
5158422 other countries would get inroads into our markets and it would be hard to recover from it
5158423 its moving out towards the orchards and getting closer to those and thats when we could get into a real problem with the export its not even just export that guy cant even sell his fruit its not even good for making apple sauce
5158424 all of the sudden the warehouse comes and tells you we can no longer take your fruit and youre sitting there going well crop insurance doesnt cover this
5158425 basically its an empty feeling you might as well have been hit by frost or weather problems because its just going to destroy your crop
5158426 thats 90 every two weeks to spray these for the rest of the season
5158427 can you see the homeowner doing that all summer long every two weeks putting out 180 a month to take care of their ornamental trees it just doesnt happen

5158433 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5158434 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5158435 thank you so much for all the help you gave us regarding his head chest and eye problems i did find our journey with you so interesting what a refreshing and informative doctor you are
5158436 thank you very much for seeing me yesterday and for the advice and information you gave me in response to my quesions

5158438 i would just like to say thank you for all the years you have been looking after me with all my problems
5158439 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5158440 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5158441 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5158442 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5158443 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5158444 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5158445 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5158446 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5158447 who are open to doing something on the production side
5158448 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5158449 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5158450 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5158451 i recognized you from your shirts logo im erik you know from
5158452 it says a lot for the players that actually played tonight probably more than the blokes who are coming back
5158453 the boys were nervous jacob timpano didnt train yesterday he had a jab and painkiller before the game we couldnt practice a lot this week with jake and it was also his first game back in two years so it was a big occasion for him
5158454 he steps up for the free kicks corners hell grow in stature with a bit more time and hell get more time when you got someone that can take dead balls like that you got to find a spot on the field for him somewhere
5158455 hes done a lot of fitness work but hes still behind all the others
5158456 ashley has been fantastic for us im pleased gabby and john have signed new contracts and weve got a couple more players that we are looking to do exactly the same with with ashley young being one of them
5158457 we are in conversation about that i dont think the chairman randy lerner has any major problem about sorting out wages for people if they are doing the business week in and week out on the pitch
5158458 agbonlahor has done that in my two seasons here carew has been terrific since being swapped with milan baros at lyon and young has been absolute class
5158459 it means he will get a new contract ashley hasnt come and asked for anything
5158460 he has got a number of years left to run on his contract but id like to sort him out and i am sure he is enjoying his football here which is great

5158466 one of the injuries is an accumulated injury in the past he has not dropped out of any competition easily
5158467 his right heel injury has been a problem since six years ago even before the athens olympics
5158468 on august 16 we arrived at the olympic village medical experts analyzed lius injury and specified there was a problem on lius achilless tendon
5158469 since athens his main goal was to achieve gold in beijing
5158470 todays result was not perfect for all of us and especially liu xiang he has been under great pressure and expectations from all of us

5158480 if anything ever happened to her i would just shut down i couldnt go on
5158481 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5158482 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5158483 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5158484 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5158485 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5158486 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5158487 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5158488 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5158489 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5158490 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5158491 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5158492 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5158493 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5158494 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5158495 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5158496 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5158497 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5158498 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5158499 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5158500 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5158501 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5158502 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5158503 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5158504 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5158505 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5158506 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5158507 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5158508 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5158509 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5158510 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5158511 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5158512 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5158513 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5158514 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5158515 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5158516 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5158517 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

5158522 i said to the group i want to see the side evolve when it is not going their way
5158523 i spoke about climbing over the mountain when it gets a little bit tough to get out of situations finding out about each other
5158524 i thought at times the players were not demanding enough of each other when st kilda were just kicking the ball around
5158525 that results in uncontested marks and an easy path to goals
5158526 as i said to the group after the game look no further than yourself ask yourself what happened and what can be the difference in performance from one week to the next
5158527 the game is not that difficult from a basic thing like manning up when they have got the ball
5158528 at times you are not going to finish up on your direct opponent but it is how you cover for each other get the best of foxtel
5158529 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5158530 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5158531 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5158532 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5158533 thank you so much for all the help you gave us regarding his head chest and eye problems i did find our journey with you so interesting what a refreshing and informative doctor you are
5158534 thank you very much for seeing me yesterday and for the advice and information you gave me in response to my quesions
5158535 thank you very much for all you have done for us we are both very grateful
5158536 i would just like to say thank you for all the years you have been looking after me with all my problems
5158537 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5158538 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5158539 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5158540 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5158541 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5158542 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5158543 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5158544 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5158545 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5158546 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5158547 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5158548 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5158549 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5158550 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5158551 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5158552 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5158553 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5158554 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5158555 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5158556 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5158557 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5158558 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5158559 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5158560 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

5158594 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions

5158596 the safir ambassador rocket was successfully launched all its systems are iranian made
5158597 although conflict has many aspects one that warfighters and policy makers often talk about is the motivation to fight which undoubtedly has its origins in the brain and is reflected in peripheral neurophysiological processes
5158598 so one question would be how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight other questions raised by controlling the mind how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands as cognitive neuroscience and related technologies become more pervasive using technology for nefarious purposes becomes easier
5158599 i am going to georgia this weekend to get the facts first hand and to show my support for georgias people and its democratically elected government

5158677 since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 under the guise of an effective but undeclared state of emergency the administration of george w bush has proceeded with the systemic demolition of the constitutional order of the united states the white house chief has instituted illegal espionage operations at home and has become embroiled in pre emptive war abroad has resorted to legalized torture and the abduction disappearance of suspected terrorists and has kept thousands of enemy non combatants under indefinite arrest detaining them in an archipelago of clandestine and floating prisons under the control of the pentagon and the central intelligence agency in a permanent state of emergency the exception becomes the rule in the case of the united states the war became the ontological foundation of the state all these years bush has governed through fear encouraging nationalism and exploiting the racial and ethno religious prejudice of his fellow countrymen
5158678 the united states is in the early years of a long struggle similar to what our country faced in the early years of the cold war

5158688 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5158689 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5158690 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5158691 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5158692 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5158726 entre mauricio funes y el fmln no existe una alianza lo que existe es unidad
5158727 esta plataforma que hoy presentamos es el resultado de la consulta ciudadana m s amplia que jam s antes se haya desarrollado en el pa s la redacci n final es resultado de un proceso de an lisis depuraci n y redacci n de un equipo conformado por gerson mart nez norma guevara el dr sevilla un economista miembro de los amigos de mauricio hato hasb n y mi persona
5158728 ni sus im genes trastocadas ni los n meros inflados del candidato de la derecha que dice haber recorrido m s municipios de los que en verdad ha recorrido ser n capaces de enga ar a un pueblo que ha despertado de las mentiras en que el partido de derecha los ha mantenido por cerca de 20 a os
5158729 el nico r cord que puede adjudicarse este gobierno de arena es haber convertido al pa s en uno de los pa ses m s violentos en donde se cometen 8 o m s asesinatos diarios
5158730 a ustedes secuestradores del estado les insisto la hora de ustedes ha terminado es la hora del cambio y de todos los que queremos a nuestro pa s
5158731 parad jicamente se rasgan las vestiduras en defensa del mercado y alertan sobre una perniciosa intervenci n del estado en la econom a ante una victoria electoral del fmln estos son los que han estimulado durante todos estos a os un uso patrimonialista del estado en beneficio de peque os grupos asociados con el partido del gobierno y en detrimento de la mayor a de empresarios en el pa s
5158732 mi gobierno ser el mejor defensor de la iniciativa privada porque entiende que para repartir con equidad y justicia la riqueza primero hay que producirla y para ello necesitamos que los emprendedores privados y el estado sellen una fuerte alianza desde el inicio
5158733 por eso invitamos a todas las fuerzas pol ticas y sociales del pa s convencidas de la necesidad del cambio a sumar voluntades para alcanzar un entendimiento nacional que nos permita definir una estrategia nacional de desarrollo para asegurar la estabilidad y la certidumbre que el pa s requiere
5158734 no nos perdamos en este recorrido hagamos a un lado los fantasmas que nos quiere imponer la derecha en el poder no es del debate entre capitalismo o socialismo el que debe ocupar nuestras energ as es el debate entre democracia y autoritarismo entre cambio o continuismo entre pasado o futuro
5158735 despu s de 38 a os de iniciadas las luchas sociales en el pa s la figura de mauricio funes y el fmln han vuelto a unir a las diferentes fuerzas sociales profesionales y pol ticas del pa s en virtud de un cambio positivo que el pa s entero urge y necesita
5158736 el cambio requiere de la participaci n de todos y todas las que deseamos que el pa s se dirija por un rumbo democr tico todo lo anterior s lo ha sido un proceso necesario para llegar a este estadio de pluralismo en la sociedad y que ahora se ve reflejado en el movimiento amplio que apoyamos la candidatura de mauricio y sobre todo la lucha por asentar la democracia en el salvador
5158737 este es un momento hist rico para el pa s mauricio y el fmln est n abanderando un movimiento social amplio en donde estamos y cabemos todos aquellos que deseamos un pa s mejor y democr tico

5158747 cole describing cenas style as pound and ground is ridiculous on so many levels

5158749 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
5158750 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise

5158755 knowing how to pull yourself out of settling for mediocrity is not easy for most of us knowing that we should is something most of us need to start thinking about and learning today
5158756 hopefully by now youve established an emergency fund and have begun paying down that debt but what about setting aside money for the upcoming holiday season how do you plan on paying for all the gifts travel and food
5158757 unless you suddenly win the lottery money isnt going to fall into your pocket hoping for a big lottery win is no way to plan for your future so here are some proven ways that you can start getting wealthy right now
5158758 many of your favorite brands are drastically reducing product sizes without a corresponding drop in price in some cases the price has even gone up while the quantities have gone down
5158759 youve worked hard for your money pay taxes on the money youve earned why not minimize taxation upon your death
5158760 for many of us college is our first experience with managing our finances completely on our own and it can be difficult to keep everything straight there are several cheap and easy ways to manage your money effectively without spending a lot of time on it
5158761 we have a law here that school cannot start until after labor day so school is still a long ways off in the minds of most children around here i challenge you to save more then you spend this year getting ready for back to school

5158765 casey menekan ketat di lap pertama lebih bagus ketimbang di laguna seca karena dia berharap saya menyerang saya mengakhiri lap pertama dengan tertinggal 1 detik namun setelah lap pertama saya melhat bahwa hari ini akan sangat mungkin buat menang
5158766 di lap terakhir sebelum stoner berhenti saya tertinggal 1 3 detik darinya saya sangat yakin saya dapat mengejarnya balapan masih sangat panjang dan saya berpikir saya bisa setelah itu saya melihat motor merah tergelincir dan saya rasa ah ini sangatlah mudah
5158767 ini merupakan keuntungan yang penting namun masih terlalu dini masih ada enam balapan yang harus dilewati jadi jika saya dapat terus seperti ini saya akan mencoba mengalahkannya kalau tak mungkin saya akan finis di belakangnya tidak di bawah posisi kedua
5158768 stoner berharap balapan bisa di menangkan dengan dng mudah seperti2 yg lalu yg cenderung terlalu mendominasi so dia belum siap untuk fighting secara ketat
5158769 lius injury has been diagnosed as something wrong with his hamstring but not with the bone
5158770 it is an accumulated injury due to long training and it will affect him if he uses power
5158771 it wont cause problems for the heats but im worried about the semi finals and the final
5158772 the march of the volunteers chinas national anthem is ringing out in every stadium
5158773 chinese lag behind in track and field despite all the efforts we have made to improve it is still a long way to go before we catch up with the world level
5158774 with events like track and field chinas pace in winning gold medals will slow down
5158775 the reception issues began immediately with 3g flip flopping between no signal and up to four bars but usually hovering between none and two
5158776 it amazes me how widespread this problem obviously is and how little at amp t and especially apple has done in acknowledging and addressing this issue
5158777 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain infineon is the 3g supplier
5158778 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users
5158779 some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows

5158783 no hubo indicaci n de que alguno de los indocumentados detenidos hubiera estado involucrado en cualquier actividad de tipo terrorista
5158784 los detenidos suelen ser procesados sin asesor a legal y por ende su deportaci n se acelera considerablemente sin haber tenido la oportunidad de contactar a sus familiares ni haber tenido acceso a ning n tipo de consejer a judicial queremos ver que todos los inmigrantes detenidos en estas redadas puedan comparecer frente a un juez el problema es que ice tiene m s recursos de los que nosotros tenemos necesitamos contribuciones de todos aquellos que creen en la justicia sean ciudadanos o inmigrantes

5158790 we have safely placed senator mccain in a cone of silence
5158791 was the cone of silence comfortable that you were in just now
5158792 sometimes reality has a way of sneaking up and biting us in the ass and when the dam bursts all you can do is swim the world of pretend is a cage not a cocoon we can only lie to ourselves for so long we are tired we are scared denying it doesnt change the truth sooner or later we have to put aside our denial and face the world head on guns blazing de nile its not just a river in its a freakin ocean so how do you keep from drowning in it
5158793 all blame is a waste of time no matter how much fault you find with another and regardless of how much you blame him it will not change you the only thing blame does is to keep the focus off you when you are looking for external reasons to explain your unhappiness or frustration you may succeed in making another feel guilty about something by blaming him but you wont succeed in changing whatever it is about you that is making you unhappy
5158794 the reality of the other person lies not in what he reveals to you but what he cannot reveal to you therefore if you would understand him listen not to what he says but rather to what he does not say
5158795 we used to be a truck store that sold some cars now were a car store that sells some trucks
5158796 thankfully we live where we live because my retired folks are a little more insulated from the hiccups of the economy and they dont drive as much so the fuel economy concerns arent as great as say if you lived in a metropolitan area and you were commuting from an hour away nonetheless a lot of the folks that are retired were depression era kids or young adults during that time so they still watch their pennies
5158797 inexpensive used cars and fuel efficient new cars thats what sells these days
5158798 some of our customers would have never considered used cars in the past but theyre buying them now
5158799 were seeing an increase in used car sales with new car dealers their focus is selling their inventory but the greatest motivation is gasoline prices people are looking for more efficient vehicles right now
5158800 people seeing an increase in sales are the people with economy cars the honda civic toyota prius
5158801 those cars are doing big numbers honda civic outsold the ford truck that hasnt happened in a long time where the ford truck hasnt outsold everything prius sales were down last month compared to the month before but its because all the dealers are sold out
5158802 we were the no 1 titan dealer in the country so we sold a lot of titans here our titan sales have gone down and instead were selling more sentras and altimas folks are still buying theyre just looking for smaller models
5158803 one sales strategy is 2 99 gas for as long as you own the car
5158804 dealers are telling me that they think theyve seen the bottom and consumers are beginning to return to the lots
5158805 people can only go for so long before they start to tend to major issues like what kind of vehicle they drive
5158806 i struggled socially i struggled with my parents it was not a fun time but it was a formative time and it played a big role in who i became
5158807 a lot of people in their 20s and 30s relate because they had similar experiences and parents want to know whats going on with their teenagers
5158808 i think it has that crossover appeal to different generations
5158809 its pretty tame compared to some of their experiences that werent in the movie
5158810 it was impossible for me to stand by and not give my input for whatever it was worth in the end
5158811 i stay friends with the people i make movies about but filming them is a one time thing
5158812 and now it appears that people taking antidepressants who also have relatively higher depression scores fare significantly worse when attempting to perform a computerized simulation of driving
5158813 and i wouldnt want to instill fear in drivers but i think that perhaps individuals who are taking these medications should just be aware of the fact that they may cause concentration problems and impair reaction time
5158814 this issue is not just a question for drivers because the cognitive skills needed for driving are also needed for a lot of other skills
5158815 there is already a very deep literature about subtle impairments of higher cognitive function associated with clinical depression itself apart from medications
5158816 i would add that in any case medication package inserts routinely warn patients about a whole host of issues when starting a course of psychotropic drugs including warning against the handling of machinery driving or engaging in any occupation in which you can be injured so to that extent this concern isnt new
5158817 laughter is whats called an adjunctive therapy it doesnt particularly cure anything all by itself but a positive attitude and a freedom from fear and despair or depression is an ally in the other treatments
5158818 its a lot of fun you feel a little bit awkward at first but then before you know it youre in hysterics and youre not really sure at what but you feel great
5158819 laughter is so healthful its so good for us in life to balance our emotions to reduce stress and most people are not laughing nearly enough

5158824 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
5158825 the key importance of this is that it gives us a clear idea of the sorts of chemicals and mechanisms in the brain that are involved in bipolar disorder
5158826 over a number of years that will help researchers to develop better approaches to diagnosis and treatment
5158827 those are mass murders but really what they are are suicides preceded by mass murder
5158828 what youve got in the virginia tech guy and all these other folk who commit suicide after they perpetuate the mass murder are people who are depressed and suicidal and theyre trying to make a big statement
5158829 unfortunately these particular people are not getting assistance that maybe could have made a difference in terms of counseling and it results in these kinds of tragedies
5158830 excessive media coverage of campus threats clearly contributes to their proliferation members of the news media are urged to limit reporting of these incidents as much as possible
5158831 when theres a suicide you should not report where it happened how it happened what weapons were used etc because people will imitate that behavior and thats pretty much what were seeing because theyre all in schools

5158857 there were times when our family couldnt afford lights but because he loved to study he used candles and kerosene lamps
5158858 most students said they learned more from him than any other teacher
5158859 he was a dear friend and a real fighter for civil rights he was very very bright and highly intelligent
5158860 what made him a good teacher he didnt take any foolishness and he was in charge

5158883 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5158884 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5158885 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

5158895 sometimes the more expensive it is the healthier it is
5158896 value at pcc is about unsurpassed quality based on organic and local foods
5158897 i hope in the long run that people open their eyes and see the injustices that are apparent to some but apparently not to all people
5158898 i hope theres something to be done to make these systems for food more equal
5158899 who would ever think youre going to find ginger at the minimart

5158924 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5158925 we are waiting for them to come back with the law in english
5158926 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5158927 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5158928 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5158929 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5158930 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5158931 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5158932 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia

5158946 saya sudah mengaku salah dan meminta maaf padanya sampai pakai nangis segala saat itu kami berjanji untuk memperbaiki hubungan yang sempat retak itu saya benar benar lega karena persoalan itu saya anggap sudah selesai namun beberapa bulan kemudian dia kembali membahas perselingkuhan itu itu terjadi beberapa kali terutama saat kami bertengkar jadi bingung harus dengan apa lagi ya membuat dia tidak mengungkit masalah itu lagi
5158947 secara mulut memang dia bilang selesai awalnya saya pun mengira seperti itu sampai suatu kali kami terlibat pertengkaran eh dia kembali mengungkit ungkit persoalan itu bukannya saya waktu itu sudah minta maaf padanya kenapa sekarang dipersoalkan lagi
5158948 enggak apa apa kok lain kali jangan begitu lagi ya

5158951 tapi sekarang dia hobi banget membahas masa lalu saya saya capek harus menjelaskan berulang kali keingintahuan dia seperti tak pernah terpuaskan pasangan kerap mengucapkan mengapa saya sampai terlibat pada masalah itu bagaimana dia tahu hal itu tidak akan terjadi lagi kelak lama lama saya memilih tak menjawab pertanyaannya
5158952 pasangan tetap belum bisa menerima sepenuhnya kesalahan ibu saya dia masih merasa sakit hati oleh ucapannya waktu itu padahal saya sudah memintanya melupakan itu semua dan berusaha memaklumi saya pikir dia sudah melakukan itu ternyata belum buktinya dia selalu mengungkit masalah itu setiap kali dia kesal pada ibu saya
5158953 pasangan pernah sempat senewen dengan gurauan saya salah saya juga sih membangunkan singa tidur saya pernah bergurau ingin mencari istri baru konteksnya pada saat itu kami sedang bercanda rupanya gurauan saya ditanggapi serius olehnya sudah berkali kali saya bilang itu cuma bercanda tidak usah diambil hati tapi dasar perempuan tetap saja dia penasaran dan berusaha mengorek ngorek saya di lain hari hahaha apa kata bercanda belum cukup ya bagi perempuan

5158980 chad being chad hes been loony and kooky since hes been here were much better if hes on our team
5158981 i could very easily see him hitting a grand slam hes having i dont want to say spectacular but hes having a pretty good year i didnt like wheeler against him either
5158982 hes got a pretty good shot at tying it up
5158983 with byrd and a single we still have the lead extra bases maybe ties it up and a home run wins the game but i could easily imagine hamilton tying it up right there so i chose to walk him even though byrd was 2 for 3 with an extra base hit off wheeler id rather see him up there

5158985 that was the pitch to hit a hanging breaking ball
5158986 he executed the next pitch ive got to come through in that situation

5158988 fda has concluded that an adequate margin of safety exists for bpa at current levels of exposure from food contact uses
5158989 fda is the premier agency responsible for the safety of our food
5158990 fdas thorough analysis confirms that food contact materials containing bpa can continue to be used safely
5158991 clearly their effort was to minimize people being concerned about this
5158992 it just seems that whenever there is an opportunity to look at a new important issue they just seem to be siding with industrys point of view
5158993 grow old with me the best is yet to be the last of life for which the first was made
5158994 israeli american author playwright and womens rights activist naomi ragen
5158995 lamenting the end of womens dialogue that for one brief moment oslo allowed
5158996 if we women israeli and palestinian could just keep sitting together and talking wed get a lot done
5158997 now if only the anonymous jordanian blueblood prime ministerial wannabe tzipi livni and naomi of course could sit down over a cuppa a new era of peace and harmony would dawn in the holy land yeah right
5158998 naomi is convinced the controversial wall separating israel and the west bank is essential for security
5158999 a fence that would have prevented her neighbours from the arab village beit iksa coming to their construction jobs these were honourable men coming in to do their jobs and we never ever had any trouble with any of them why would i cut them off from their livelihoods if anything had ever happened of course id have been the first to have insisted on the fence
5159000 during the intifada beit iksa villagers regularly walked across the wadi and up the steps past my home to work in construction jobs in ramot and elsewhere this even after terrorists were found with suicide belts in ramot the police never checked these workers despite repeated phone calls and warnings
5159001 the number one item on her agenda would be to introduce the death penalty for terrorists we need to kill these people not let them sit in our jails and then trade them to freedom in return for the bodies of israeli soldiers who lost their lives protecting their country
5159002 because we are living through the most ignorant time in jewish history they dont realise that there was never a palestinian state here never a real state between the babylonian destruction and the reborn state of israel
5159003 there was no such thing as palestinians when was there an independent palestinian people with a palestinian state it was either southern syria before the first world war and then it was a palestine including jordan it was not as though there was a palestinian people in palestine considering itself as a palestinian people and we came and threw them out and took their country away from them they did not exist

5159007 it is not just external threats that ragen sees as a challenge she has recently spoken out against the introduction of segregated buses in jerusalem in which women are forced to sit at the back so they dont offend ultra orthodox sensibilities if you have a situation where all of a sudden the private realm of religion starts dictating where you can sit on a bus thats a challenge for the whole country and that is something that needs to be dealt with no less than the military problems and the secular problems that we have said ragen who labels herself modern orthodox
5159008 markets will be largely range bound even if oil falls economy will soften and earnings will be slower than the last 4 5 years earnings may be downgraded in next 6 months these are going to be drags on the economy

5159013 in the end the only part of the project that remained was the library which was completed in 1776
5159014 in the spirit of the counter reformation monasteries had to have a ceremonial hall aimed to impress
5159015 admonts benedictine monks chose the library since the rule of saint benedict pray work and study places special emphasis on reading
5159016 the architect josef hueber wanted light to flood this place and the mind

5159125 the whole point of the new policy is to make it far less likely that congress will have to engineer a bailout
5159126 it is a very serious problem and it has led to a whole host of additional problems in the marketplace
5159127 its definitely a vehicle that has and can be used by those who effectively want to push the price of the stock down and do it rapidly
5159128 an extension to every stock is going to begin to make trading in all securities more cumbersome and more expensive
5159129 larger fund managers are hopeful they will be the beneficiaries as the scale of the swfs limits their ability to spend governance resources on investigating smaller boutiques

5159134 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5159135 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are unhappy with their lot some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits
5159136 im a bloke who respects women i believe we should look after women
5159137 im told men outnumber women here by five to one if thats the case then perhaps its an opportunity for some lonely women
5159138 its not councils view and its not mine its hard when youve got to defend something someone else has said were definitely appalled
5159139 its a public attack on women and a form of verbal and emotional abuse
5159140 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests the men will settle for anything i think its quite disgusting if he wants to come and visit our service im more than happy to have a yarn to him about what hes saying
5159141 theyre very archaic comments i dont think he realises the repercussions of labelling women based solely on their looks
5159142 the article didnt paint a very good picture of the men here either but ive never been treated with anything but the utmost respect ive never walked into a club and been preyed upon theyve been lovely
5159143 the 2006 census shows where there is an imbalance its not an extreme one
5159144 i am concerned about the gender imbalance but not issues such as looks thats pretty superficial

5159150 and there is no reason to believe that they were exchanged in a nonviolent manner the evidence from the western extension of the lbk leaves little room for any other conclusion but that the lbk mesolithic interactions were at best chilly and at worst hostile

5159154 all these barbarians have the law of wild asses they are born live and die in a liberty without restraint they do not know what is meant by bridle and bit
5159155 they brand us for slaves and call us miserable souls whose life is not worth having
5159156 value themselves above anything that you can imagine and this is the reason they always give for it that ones as much master as another and since men are all made of the same clay there should be no distinction or superiority among them
5159157 wouldnt it be nice to go back to when only the kitchen was on fire

5159171 were not the only ngo nongovernment organization to have suffered an attack unfortunately we suffered the most egregious and most tragic of these attacks
5159172 we are not only deeply saddened but also outraged at this unprovoked and wanton slaughter of four innocent victims who were committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the afghan people on an impartial basis of only meeting the needs of the vulnerable

5159178 ive periodically toyed with crafting a step by step for the wage slave trying to break it all down to the easiest first steps that give the most reward and positive feedback for turning it around
5159179 have you ever thought of doing freelance work i work freelance most of the time and it provides me with more time than working 40 hours a week at an office does
5159180 how confident can any of us really be that you are leading us in a useful direction
5159181 hey chief i only need half as much money now so how about you pay me half my salary and i only come in half as often
5159182 jon young reminds people that you have to always come up to the boundaries of your comfort zone if you dont you wont make any progress if you go much further than that you push too hard and recoil
5159183 not at all you should never feel confident that anyone leads you basically if you find yourself following someone youve already set off in the wrong direction
5159184 i would like to clarify that my criticism was of what you write here and my disappointment that you didnt discuss more practical experiments and activities in more detail
5159185 an afternoon of arts and crafts eating more meat and buying a different brand of shoes is about all i have seen so far other than labyrinthine essays and
5159186 but my basic concern is that his position is based mostly on theory derived mostly from historic examples with very little modern day hands on practice to back it up
5159187 but my basic concern is that his position is based mostly on theory derived mostly from historic examples with very little modern day hands on practice to back it up
5159188 its fair to question whether jasons escape plan is hollow theory
5159189 im sure shane meant that jasons position is based on a combination of theory and historical example i understood his point the point is jasons position is hardly supported by jasons experience
5159190 he could be grossly underestimating the difficulty of living a forager lifestyle
5159191 im sorry you feel im being disrespectful but theres much at stake here this is a life or death subject
5159192 if we tried to shelter ourselves and feed ourselves with what we know now wed only ensure our death whether by starvation thirst or exposure
5159193 i will accept the rules that you feel necessary to your freedom i am free no matter what rules surround me if i find them tolerable i tolerate them if i find them too obnoxious i break them i am free because i know that i alone am morally responsible for everything i do

5159195 can i collect enough calories within a reasonable walkable area consistently enough over the year to sustain me
5159196 was contemptuous of much empirical experimentation though not of all experiment and seems to have had no conception of inductive inference at all
5159197 nothing evolution brings forth is perfect its just damnably hard to improve upon
5159198 we have to anticipate the possibility that i can keep doing this without getting shot
5159199 can i collect enough calories within a reasonable walkable area consistently enough over the year to sustain me

5159201 but theyre not plentiful enough to provide for anything like an iron age society
5159202 no just the easiest ones to get to theres the real problem what fossil fuels remain are so difficult to get to that you need fossil fuels to get them
5159203 but how are you going to raise and feed a herd of domesticated horses in a future where agriculture has become impossible
5159204 do you think that hunting gathering can play a useful part in bringing balance and health to our wilderness areas

5159208 anyone who believes that growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
5159209 keeley finds brutish behavior everywhere and at all times including among the american indian if the number of casualties produced by wars among the plains indians was proportional to the population of european nations during the world wars then the casualty rates would have been more like 2 billion rather than the tens of millions that obtained
5159210 native americans were involved in more violence after the europeans arrived than before
5159211 we do know that human colonists caused extinctions in isolated tightly bound island settings but islands are fundamentally different from continents
5159212 the overkill hypothesis attempts to compare the incomparable and there is no evidence of human caused environmental change in north america but there is evidence of climate change overkill is bad science because it is immune to the empirical record
5159213 martins overkill theory is glitzy easy to understand and fits with our image of ourselves as all powerful it also fits well with the modern green movement and the judeo christian view of our place in the world but there is no reason to believe that the early peoples of north america did what martins argument says they did
5159214 of the 35 genera to have become extinct beginning around 20 000 years ago only 15 can be shown to have survived beyond 12 000 years ago
5159215 the clovis peoples didnt arrive until shorty before 11 000 years ago that leaves 20 genera unaccounted for
5159216 the interesting thing that we say about the extinctions is that whatever happened it wasnt due to humans
5159217 these populations are already significantly in decline and on the brink of whatever was going to happen to them in the future
5159218 you can see that young aspen and willow were abundant in the early 1900s by the 1930s the trees had stopped regenerating and there are no young ones
5159219 worked 36 per cent of the time and 35 per cent of the people did not work at all
5159220 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
5159221 however i wonder how important it is to rebut a magazine entitled
5159222 qualitatively commensurate with what one wants to achieve and dependent of individuals will
5159223 the problem here is not the chicken but the egg
5159224 but put in those terms it does make me wonder if you dont want to kill animals do you want to kill plants
5159225 acorns walnuts and the three sisters who definitely dont have to lead to agriculture can become the basis for a minoritarian vegetarian strata within the primitivist milieu i dont consider myself a nutritionist so lets assume for now that nutritionally that could work but if you can only eat those things then you need to produce a very large amount of them the real key to the success of sustainable lifestyles lies in the huge variety in their diet we humans will always leave a big footprint but the width of our footprint decreases its depth hunter gatherers have enormous ecological footprints the land it takes to support them covers enormous amounts of acreage but they also live lightly on the land because they eat a little of everything they dont put an undue burden on anything
5159226 but i also keep coming back to the question why i could understand risking things like this if we had a good reason something that made vegetarianism a goal that we should pursue or at least that some of us should pursue but i cant understand the reason for it and that makes risks like these very difficult to understand
5159227 i think you may have taken hardin a bit too literally his model certainly applies quite well to many real phenomena in the world around us even if the specific historical institution of the english commons deviated from the definition of the commons a bit to avoid that occurance
5159228 the problem here is not the chicken but the egg
5159229 i would say that our social limits arise from our ecology we conceived of those social limits because of our ecology
5159230 how can there be a god if god allows extinctions to take place
5159231 i dont understand why a world of deep meaningful relationships requires either
5159232 we are just another species to be done away with
5159233 the meaning of life is in the living of it
5159234 also someone meets girls through gaming does the girl happen to have a beard and live in moms basement
5159235 and for the gaming haters gaming is certainly a better pass time than for example internet trolling
5159236 the only reason some people are still alive is because its against the law to kill them
5159237 youre a big meaniehead and you look funny so im not gonna listen to you
5159238 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5159239 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5159240 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5159241 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5159242 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5159243 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5159244 nazario said that he was asked are they dead yet
5159245 ive put in applications everywhere for everything but nobody wants to hire you if you have been indicted
5159246 my faith in the system is shaken theres no doubt about that
5159247 there are no bodies no forensic evidence no crime scene and no identities
5159248 thirty five years after the supreme court decided roe v
5159249 throughout my career ive been a consistent and strong supporter of reproductive justice and have consistently had a 100 pro choice rating with planned parenthood and naral pro choice america
5159250 when south dakota passed a law banning all abortions in a direct effort to have roe overruled i was the only candidate for president to raise money to help the citizens of south dakota repeal that law
5159251 moreover i believe in and have supported common sense solutions like increasing access to affordable birth control to help prevent unintended pregnancies
5159252 but we also know that roe v wade is about more than a womans right to choose its about equality its about whether our daughters are going to have the same opportunities as our sons and so to truly honor that decision we need to update the social contract so that women can free themselves and their children from violent relationships so that a mom can stay home with a sick child without getting a pink slip so that she can go to work knowing that theres affordable quality childcare for her children and so that the american dream is within reach for every family in this country this anniversary reminds us that its not enough to protect the gains of the past we have to build a future thats filled with hope and possibility for all americans
5159253 at its core abortion is a human tragedy to effect meaningful change we must engage the debate at a human level
5159254 i will tell you that i dont believe in gay marriage but i do think that people who are gay and lesbian should be treated with dignity and respect and that the state should not discriminate against them so i believe in civil unions that allow a same sex couple to visit each other in a hospital or transfer property to each other i dont think it should be called marriage but i think that it is a legal right that they should have that is recognized by the state if people find that controversial then i would just refer them to the sermon on the mount which i think is in my mind for my faith more central than an obscure passage in romans thats my view but we can have a respectful disagreement on that
5159255 i support the efforts of the people of california to recognize marriage as a unique institution between a man and a woman just as we did in my home state of arizona i do not believe judges should be making these decisions
5159256 im proud to have led an effort in my home state to change our state constitution and to protect the sanctity of marriage as between a man and woman
5159257 i believe that we need to fund this this is a tough issue for those of us in the pro life community i would remind you that these stem cells are either going to be discarded or perpetually frozen we need to do what we can to relieve human suffering its a tough issue i support federal funding
5159258 what the hell made me think that is a good image
5159259 there was a lot of boxing and a lot of pushing
5159260 i was worried about someone going down but i ran hard
5159261 in the final im not going to be running for a time ill be running for a gold medal
5159262 but i definitely feel like im in great shape i think im very close to seeing a 48 seconds

5159272 she is as nervous as hell but at the same time itching to get back in front of the same audience where she screwed up so badly last time
5159273 it is the perfect platform for her to announce to her fans and the world that the dark days are behind her and shes back on track with her life and her career
5159274 its wonderful but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot
5159275 this is her big chance to make amends and let everyone see that she is becoming the britney of old again

5159294 if we were asked for more training teams that would be really hard for us to do were just about capped out at what were providing now
5159295 we have these pity parties in kabul about how much the afghan soldiers need no they need good leadership
5159296 were doing a little bit of nation building but thats ok because its going to help us with counter insurgency
5159297 hes asking his military people to provide those kinds of services and knowledge base for things they his troops may not be very expert in
5159298 we are providing the security for this road then the contractors will come and they can start their work
5159299 such ambitious plans as long as they are complemented by sustained resources and a realistic assessment of timelines are not a bad thing
5159300 the real problem comes if ambitious rhetoric is unmatched by funding or long term commitment since that raises local expectations and leaves them frustrated
5159301 they have qualified here on their own terms we did not need a wild card to compete
5159302 those years were terrible every day was hearing bad news
5159303 ive just found out one of our athletes has been killed by the taliban while driving on the road to kabul from kandahar
5159304 training in those days was terrible there were bombs exploding around us and people would come in telling us to pray all the time
5159305 there are many different faces different languages here so sometimes they dont like each other
5159306 when free market democracy is pursued in the presence of a market dominant minority the almost invariable result is backlash this backlash typically takes one of three forms the first is a backlash against markets targeting the market dominant minoritys wealth the second is a backlash against democracy by forces favorable to the market dominant minority the third is violence sometimes genocidal directed against the market dominant minority itself
5159307 line up behind the entrance so we can card you
5159308 were not as concerned about it as we initially were
5159309 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5159310 the water temperature everything was pretty good there we just got unlucky
5159311 i was looking forward to getting a lot of laps under our belt here and getting comfortable and making sure everything was together underneath me and we were going to have a great day
5159312 it just didnt work out its just experience so its just hard thats whats bad about this deal here
5159313 if you want blu ray go get blu ray this product is meant to improve playback of dvds
5159314 simple solution is to return the device to the store provider from which it was purchased and demand repair or replacement
5159315 do you think these people are stupid that theyll settle for investing at a 5 or maybe 10 rate here instead of a 15 or 20 rate in a developing country
5159316 theres no appointment but he might walk into my office any time i suppose
5159317 at the moment were getting towards decision time on all those issues
5159318 we certainly love nigel as a player and obviously the question is we havent been able to get nigel as a player because his body hasnt quite been able to carry him
5159319 this year hasnt given us much encouragement but we were hoping he could because hes a sort of slightly built guy who doesnt seem to take a lot of work but were hypothesising and speculating
5159320 hes doing a little bit of what shaun hart used to do and nigel lappin used to do
5159321 when you watch him play a game he runs really hard itd be an interesting study just to watch him how hard he runs and its a lesson to all our players to be honest
5159322 hes been incredible really how hes just been linking up and getting to the right spot when we need someone to run into space its been a really good first month
5159323 the summer break gave me the opportunity to focus on recharging my batteries im looking forward to getting back into the cockpit next friday looking at the season so far it feels like a different championship to 2007

5159330 there are those who question his method and whether he is following the right procedure but in his heart he must have a clear intention

5159387 this year hasnt given us much encouragement but we were hoping he could because hes a sort of slightly built guy who doesnt seem to take a lot of work but were hypothesising and speculating
5159388 hes doing a little bit of what shaun hart used to do and nigel lappin used to do
5159389 when you watch him play a game he runs really hard itd be an interesting study just to watch him how hard he runs and its a lesson to all our players to be honest

5159430 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
5159431 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares 50 million acres across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
5159432 the negative and positive implications of wastewater agriculture have only recently received attention this study offers the first comprehensive cross country analysis of the conditions that account for the practice and the difficult tradeoffs that arise from it

5159468 let them catechize 6 or 7 year olds because we should reflect on this and not have to put up with sermons or instructions from anybody
5159469 we need to say yes to the future without being afraid and without the old fear of the clergy or the vengeance of the devil

5159502 claire i would have agreed with you even a few weeks ago i felt much the same as you i think perhaps more so i was thinking of quitting maybe teach at the college or something
5159503 and then paul shows us up and all is forgotten
5159504 yes paul came to my rescue not pauls money paul what you dont know that pauls first action was to tell me to stop whining and do my job i damn near threw him out of my office once we got that settled he was right you know only then did he go on to make his offer
5159505 no yes that shows what exactly im talking about we never seem to ever get past the money in this business
5159506 id appreciate youre keeping that in confidence for pauls sake
5159507 of course but tell me more about what you and paul got settled
5159508 he asked me that same question i said something syrupy about educating our students he chuckled told me thats why i was unhappy
5159509 my job is hire those that do educate our students that takes money i get that money anywhere i can get it thats my job oh i have all those legal and administrative things the laws tell us we need to do we hand out the diplomas but ultimately we sit down at the wurlitzer press the various keys and make it rain money on our district
5159510 now i follow when times are good you get to do the fun parts when moneys tight you dont
5159511 and you myopically start blaming the money itself its the only reason you exist an assistant principal could do the rest
5159512 i wish id been there maybe paul would like to give a command performance for me
5159513 now lets get back to my plan im going to budget next year based on this years actual receipts pure and simple my finance director will do the rest hell probably bring in more than we need and well bank the difference

5159522 so the indigenous way is not majority rule because that isnt democracy democracy is consensus
5159523 for the past thirty years in ecuador weve seen the consolidation of political parties linked to powerful economic interests
5159524 each powerful economic group has had two modes of expression a political party and the media and so the social movements have had alternatives because the political parties and the media were completely controlled by those powerful economic interests the only means of expression for social movements was the power of revocation by means of demonstrations demonstrations aimed at the overthrow of presidents
5159525 pro abortion pro homosexual and has taken the name of god in vain so as to get more votes
5159526 conflicts between correa and the social movement left the indigenous movement environmentalists and unions among others have become increasingly heated
5159527 ecuador is a territory of peace the establishment of foreign military bases nor foreign installations with military objectives will not be allowed
5159528 right to secure and permanent access to healthy adequate and nutritious food preferably produced at the local level
5159529 we support yes on the constitution but we no longer support correa
5159530 we are the only face the locals see in these remote communities for them we are their government
5159531 sure the corporate responsibility projects help us to get credit lines but its not something we should worry about
5159532 a tax revenue over the extraordinary income earned by companies that have signed contracts with the state to the exploration and exploitation of non renewable resources
5159533 why the wft would be bad for ecuador and its industry
5159534 comments attributed to an unnamed lobbyist working for chevron do not reflect our companys view regarding the ecuador case they were not approved by the company and will not be tolerated
5159535 we believe that the arrogance reflected in the anonymous comment accurately reflects a pervasive attitude within chevrons culture that led to the destruction of our precious rainforest
5159536 confirms how chevron cares little for the rule of law in any country where it might be held accountable be it ecuador or the u s
5159537 no court that actually hears the evidence appears to be good enough for chevron
5159538 not a single court in the world ever has agreed with chevrons interpretation of this release but that has not stopped chevrons lobbying team from playing judge and jury to the u s congress
5159539 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5159540 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5159541 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5159542 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5159543 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5159544 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5159545 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5159546 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
5159547 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species mr
5159548 it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
5159549 the bush administration does not want to see any such connection between greenhouse gases and further damage to threatened and endangered species
5159550 we want to be ahead of the curve when it comes to safety wed much rather prevent incidents from happening than deal with them when they do
5159551 not every detector will be operational the first day of school we are allowing principals to use them at their discretion for some principals that will mean theyre used at random every day for others it would mean three days a week and for some it will mean just during special events
5159552 i dont think there was any sort of parent outcry either way im hoping the detectors will help parents feel their students are safer at our middle and high schools
5159553 there is a struggle between respecting a students right to privacy in some of these matters and disseminating enough information so that parents and teachers understand the situations
5159554 its tricky because a lot of times rumors can start over situations and urban legends about what happened at school are born
5159555 it is a difficult thing you dont want to take a young child out of school but when a situation with a weapon happens there arent a lot of options
5159556 when they walk through that door into the school we want parents to know and we want students to know that school is a safe place regardless of what else is happening outside of school
5159557 now is a terrific time for renewables to launch i hope they get all the capital they need and all the great minds and talent but i dont want it to come at the expense of the oil and gas industry
5159558 as goes colorado so goes the west as far as this energy policy debate

5159563 creating people advantage how to address hr challenges worldwide through 2015
5159564 the study the most comprehensive review of global hr practices ever conducted provides piercing insight into the current and future challenges facing companies
5159565 it may soon be harder to find and keep talented employees than to raise money in an ipo
5159566 in the west work forces are graying while in developing markets companies have an unquenchable thirst for skilled employees creating a people advantage will increasingly translate into competitive advantage
5159567 the days of company loyalty at all costs are over
5159568 employees especially the most talented ones often make career choices based on factors such as flexible work hours and emotional gratification
5159569 many executives dont realize the serious problems they could face from a loss of knowledge and productivity if they dont start preparing today for labor shortages in five or ten years
5159570 they should analyze capacity and productivity risks for each location unit and job type and then develop a series of measures to mitigate anticipated shortfalls
5159571 i had to bag the one where i drop a knife through my foot
5159572 justin was pouring very large drinks and the mortons bartender was standing behind him going hmmm

5159574 meeting the players face to face is so nice this was seriously the highlight of my year
5159575 anything a guy like cuddy is behind you want to get behind the waiters carry the bulk of the load because we get to talking with people the whole night were not qualified to wait tables
5159576 we want the guests to have a mortons experience but theyre here to have fun and to see the twins

5159578 came to the back and thanked the staff the dishwashers everyone they talked about that for a long time talk about a class act
5159579 its tough to do pictures and autographs and then they ask you wheres the food
5159580 but its great to have all these people here to see us
5159581 i say the score suggests that you may or may not have a memory problem
5159582 some level of cognitive impairment that was not previously recognized
5159583 this demonstration study is looking at what if we actually catch these people and manage their care well
5159584 if people are diagnosed earlier in the illness they are less likely to have crisis after crisis after crisis
5159585 there must be evidence that the benefits outweigh any potential harm
5159586 you might say if youre going to tell me i have a disease that has no cure i dont want to know about it right now
5159587 here is a disease that will fundamentally alter your relationship with your family your friends your future
5159588 we arent treating this like its a tragedy or a sad thing were treating it really practically
5159589 this is kind of cool because now we have the attention of some people who really want to help us

5159599 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5159600 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5159601 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5159602 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5159603 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5159604 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5159605 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5159606 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5159607 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5159608 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5159609 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5159610 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5159611 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5159612 i noticed that while doing this the ipod was still extraordinarily hot to the touch
5159613 i had asked what i could do to get a replacement ipod asap
5159614 hmmm if i get an ipod it will explode so ill go for the cheaper zen
5159615 not have much hope that this matter will be resolved in any timely fashion that my ipod will be replaced that i will be compensated for anything
5159616 apple is now saying that even if it is a faulty piece of equipment and does damage to other objects or people that it is not their responsibility to replace it unless you have a current warranty
5159617 time to upgrade and give us more of your delicious money
5159618 apple bends over backwards for you i dont know what you are talking about
5159619 he was swinging the bat well i saw him raise the level of his play he was getting the bat head out in front of the ball before the game i was saying what a catalyst he can be for us
5159620 i just happened to swing the bat a little better
5159621 i dont think ive ever done that even in the minors
5159622 but i told pitching coach jimmy hickey if we walk young to load the bases were going to walk hamilton i just thought that was prudent with the kind of year hamilton has been having i wouldnt say its spectacular its beyond that he very easily could have hit a grand slam there
5159623 i was hoping that hamilton would get the chance to swing the bat but joe didnt let that happen i still felt good with marlon up there he had a couple pitches that he could have done something with he just didnt do it
5159624 being able to go out in that sixth inning was huge i was relaxed my slider was working i got a lot of called strikes and a couple of swinging strikes with it

5159633 more people than ever are getting their news information entertainment from handheld devices but the iphone really changed the rules of that game duke shouldnt miss an opportunity to reach our many audiences in the most innovative and effective way
5159634 you have to make sites that are skinny and load fast
5159635 iphones have broken all the molds theyve become the new platform and an important means of disseminating news content theyve already created a huge market out there and its just going to get bigger
5159636 we werent able to learn as much as we hoped from other campuses
5159637 that was the catalyst for building what were calling phase i of a larger mobile strategy at duke
5159638 sometimes you can work a lot better when you know theres a deadline to hit
5159639 mobile content should be timely know where you are and provide tools that help you in your work and life
5159640 any new features will be determined by dukes leadership as part of a larger mobile web strategy although some of the technology is already being tested at duke

5159643 as you may or may not know no object can exist above 4096 meters save for avatar attachments anything that exceeds this elevation is simply returned to its owner to make matters worse only physics enabled objects such as vehicles can be moved above 768 meters any attempt to move a non physical object by editing it for example will result in its z coordinate being snapped to 768 meters but that doesnt stop items from being placed there indefinitely provided they stay still so to make a long story short i had to build everything at ground level pack it all up and place it at 4000 meters via script just because i seem to enjoy making things hard for myself i whipped up a basic script to read a notecard full of names and locations and rez the furniture from the skylounge buildings inventory not strictly necessary i suppose but it makes things easier if i end up with more furniture than can be grabbed in a single selected set anyway i basically did all this for bragging rights such that they are and in the wildly unlikely event that i decide to start doing the virtual horizontal tango ill have the most private skybox in sl the views not too shabby either the cone of white rings below everything is an homage to the classic jetsons style hover effect it seemed appropriate

5159662 my favorite idea if were convinced that ifrs is a high quality set of standards that is mandate all companies to use ifrs as of a certain date say 3 to 5 years from the date of the issued rule no optionality in between but be prepared to present all regularly reported financial information on a retrospective ifrs basis when the switch gets flipped at that certain date that would give companies ample time to develop the information as they go along it will provide information to markets on a complete and consistent basis and it will give investors educators and practitioners time to evaluate their situations

5159677 i met an old lady once almost one hundred years old and she told me
5159678 i have a history of making decisions very quickly about men i ahve always fallen in love fast and without measuring risks i have a tendency not only to see the best in everyone butto assumethat everyone is emotionally capable of reaching his highest potential i have fallen in love more times than i care to count witht he highest potential of a man rather than withthe man himself and then i have hung on to the relationshipfor a long time sometimes far too long wating for the man to ascend to his own greatness many times in romance i have been a victim of my own optimism
5159679 about a year ago we started to make environmental changes in the way we operate a lot of our clients are government and corporate clients and were very loyal to them
5159680 its been a growing concern on our minds for a while but we werent quite sure what we could do about it being that were a transport fleet weve been visiting companies that have gone carbon neutral and getting their advice
5159681 were measuring our emissions at the moment and then plan to reduce and offset them were trying to make our office as paperless as we can through recycling and reducing our electricity use
5159682 our big issue is we cant send a big six cylinder car to someones house and say its environmentally friendly the new vehicle rule is a huge step in that direction and weve investigated these cars thoroughly
5159683 weve also trialled the toyota estima hybrid which we have had for the past year now and this hybrid vehicle can hold up to 6 passengers our customers have been really stoked with the fact that were taking it seriously
5159684 we talk to them about our sustainability initiatives so they can see what were doing the drivers of the hybrids love them and so do our customers
5159685 the company has demonstrated its commitment to the environment and signalled its long term sustainability policy direction to all taxi users
5159686 we are supporting our taxicharge partners throughout new zealand in their quest for sustainability converting fleets to hybrid fuel efficient low emission vehicles is one way of achieving this
5159687 the vouchers get them from the city to home and there are seven different zones if your children are out and about and they need to get home but have no money they can use their voucher they cant exchange them for cash

5159692 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5159693 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5159694 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5159695 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5159696 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5159734 gujarat police have given us a list of suspected persons who were associated with simi after the blasts and those persons are now being questioned by the police in indore
5159735 we had taken the persons into custody earlier also when some top simi leaders were arrested from indore
5159736 we are probing all angles and as far as supply of explosives from madhya pradesh is concerned nothing concrete is found till date

5159738 the two heads of state have agreed on the establishment of diplomatic relations at ambassadorial level and have discussed various topics including the demarcation of the joint border in the course of the meetings that took place during this visit which constitutes the highest level of contact between the two countries since 2005
5159739 it was about 300 metres away from us flying away from us as we watched it and it struck another aircraft that had been coming across
5159740 it the microlight completely disintegrated in a big bang small pieces started falling down to the ground
5159741 when it first happened it looked like the plane would go straight down but the pilot recovered it and seemed to be in control of it
5159742 a search took place and we did locate two scenes of wreckage one towards coventry and one in brandon wood approximately one mile apart
5159743 as far as i am aware the single engine aircraft disintegrated pretty much in mid air debris is spread over a wide area
5159744 our priority is that we can retrieve the bodies as quickly as possible and that relatives can be notified and can have time and privacy to mourn their loss
5159745 how they collided and how they came to the collision we still do not know
5159746 there are two scenes and they are difficult to get to we are appealing for anyone who witnessed the crash to get in touch
5159747 it will save lives we know the equipment has worked in america and i think it will have a similar impact here
5159748 it can enable police to reduce gun crime to almost non existent levels

5159762 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5159763 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5159764 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5159765 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5159766 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution

5159773 if we look at individual hospitals then there is an increase in the number of patients in the last 15 20 years these have grown five to 10 fold in my hospital itself
5159774 we can only guess that diet smoking alcohol consumption and obesity could be the reasons behind the disease
5159775 but in most cases its ruled out as the disease is already in an advanced stage
5159776 it will help patients get information from the best in the field what makes it more relevant is that it will be totally in an indian context

5159782 these countries are the highest per capita receivers of aid anywhere in the world but there are still law and order and corruption problems in papua new guinea and the solomon islands the economy is still too reliant on australia and aid it is the fragility of some of these nations that is in question some of them could revert

5159831 one of my favorite people of all time is ms ellen degeneres
5159832 so i wish all the best all the happiness all the joy that comes with that certificate just the joy of being able to stand up and say that in front of everyone you love and care about in front of each other and to walk away legal is huge
5159833 i love ellen degeneres i watch her show all the time
5159834 i just want to say congratulations and i am really sorry you didnt invite me to your wedding
5159835 for over 200 years our constitution and the congress of the united states have granted the power to define marriage to the states i believe that this responsibility should be left to the states and therefore have opposed a federal marriage amendment i strongly support existing federal law signed by president clinton which ensures that no state is forced to recognize a marriage that is not within its own laws constitution or legal precedents
5159836 i believe that marriage is an institution that should be left to the church however i believe that no law in this country state or federal should discriminate against anyone because of race gender or sexual orientation and i support civil unions for same sex couples which the new hampshire legislature enacted last year i do not support amending the constitution to ban gay marriage
5159837 the federal government should repeal all laws that penalize people for not being married or which penalize people for being married and the question of homosexual marriage becomes irrelevant my wife gets to live in the usa because she is married to me i dont have much sympathy for the heartbreak some homosexual chooses to suffer by being denied similar visa opportunities but when the border is open to all the question becomes irrelevant
5159838 i am opposed to abortion except in the case of rape incest or to save the life of the mother and oppose the use of federal funds to pay for abortion as a member of congress i have supported legislation that would prevent adults from circumventing state laws which require parental notification or consent
5159839 i support a womans right to choose and i believe that it is a crucial responsibility if i am elected to the senate to confirm justices to the supreme court who will uphold the right to privacy that is enshrined in our constitution i support federal funding for preventive care including access to family planning and comprehensive sex education because i believe that abortion should be as rare as possible
5159840 abortion should be banned in the district of columbia and all military bases
5159841 faith based groups should be allowed to compete for and receive federal funds provided that they do not in any way impose their religious beliefs on those receiving their services allowing funds to go to successful program regardless of who administers them and without infringement on citizens constitutional rights is sound social and fiscal policy
5159842 i think that we should steer federal funding to social service providers who are the most effective in providing needed services and care its not their affiliation that should determine whether or not they receive funds its their efficiency if a charity with religious affiliation is able to provide the best services to the largest number of people they should received federal funding in the same way a nonreligious charity does but they must also be held to the same accountability standards to which nonreligious charities are held
5159843 i oppose the use of federal dollars for social programs
5159844 i believe the strength of a culture lies in the strength of its families
5159845 marriage is the union between a man and a woman and cannot be redefined
5159846 amending the federal constitution would be the wrong direction for this country to move
5159847 we need less federal involvement and more participation and direction in the states legislatures where people can speak loudly and clearly
5159848 marriage is defined under federal statute as the union of one man and one woman
5159849 otherwise the federal government should not interfere with state decisions
5159850 civil unions is a culturally redefining issue and should have been put in the hands of the people through referendum
5159851 even if personally i disagree with the resulting state legislation permitting civil unions gay marriage
5159852 those decisions made by the citizens of a state and its representatives should be recognized respected and accepted by the federal government so long as they do not infringe on the rights of others
5159853 each state must decide this issue according to the will of its citizens
5159854 i believe in a womans right to make this very personal choice in consultation with her physician based on her individual circumstances and beliefs and oppose any efforts to weaken that right
5159855 a childs parents should be informed of any medical procedure prior to it being performed as long as a life is not in danger while the information is being delayed
5159856 nor should we assume that strangers have a better understanding of that childs needs than her parents
5159857 too often we look to the government to solve these problems when we have local organizations that are better able to serve the people
5159858 charities should be judged on their ability to deliver services and should be open and accountable in how they receive federal support
5159859 each state must decide this issue according to the will of its citizens i approve of the action taken by the new hampshire legislature and our governor
5159860 we do not need a constitutional amendment on marriage marriage is defined under federal statute as the union of one man and one woman otherwise the federal government should not interfere with state decisions
5159861 marriage is was and always should be an issue determined in each individual state by those elected to represent its citizens those decisions made by the citizens of a state and its representatives should be recognized respected and accepted by the federal government so long as they do not infringe on the rights of others
5159862 i oppose gay marriage and would support a constitutional amendment defining marriage civil unions are a culturally redefining issue and should have been put in the hands of the people through referendum
5159863 it is for the states to regulate marriage as we are observing across this nation even if personally i disagree with the resulting state legislation permitting civil unions gay marriage
5159864 i do not assume that passing judgment on a woman who has made this difficult choice is my responsibility as a person or as a legislator choosing to have an abortion is a difficult enough decision for any woman government should respect a womans right to choose
5159865 abortion is the intentional taking of innocent human life and i oppose it we cannot expect children to be responsible for such decisions nor should we assume that strangers have a better understanding of that childs needs than her parents
5159866 i have always believed in the sanctity of life and i feel this should be left to the states to decide
5159867 i support the ban on late term abortions and for minors i support parental consent and notification
5159868 i am pro life and believe that the unborn are entitled to protection under our laws and that the role of the federal government is to make sure that those rights are not infringed save for public policy consideration given to the threat of the life of the mother incest or rape
5159869 i think religious charities should continue to get funding but as with everything else we need to monitor where our federal resources are going with our growing deficit
5159870 charities should be judged on their ability to deliver services and should be open and accountable in how they receive federal support
5159871 any group able to assist citizens in need which has shown it can accomplish the task before us should qualify for federal funding for programs and or projects that are entitled to taxpayer dollars
5159872 faith based organizations play an important role in the daily lives of many people and they should be able to receive federal funds to help those in need too often we look to government to solve these problems when we have local organizations that are better able to serve the people
5159873 limiting service providers to governmental agencies set up to provide parallel services in competition with religious groups doing the same thing is neither efficient nor generally a direction that provides for sustained quality services
5159874 since gays and lesbians are already marrying in religious ceremonies i cannot in good conscience deny their right to religious freedom and by not allowing a civil recognition of those core beliefs is to deny them rights due not only to their sexual preferences but also due to those philosophical and religious beliefs
5159875 while states have historically set the rules regarding marriage i believe that marriage is a union of a woman and a man due to my beliefs about marriage as a member of congress i voted for the constitutional amendment that protects marriage as a union of a woman and a man
5159876 i believe that the federal government should stay out of peoples private lives as well as respect the laws and desires of each state in our country for that reason i do not support the federal government legislating on the topic of marriage
5159877 gay couples should be given the opportunity to enter into contractual arrangements as anyone however the federal government should not be forced to recognize civil unions that are attempts at marriage by another name
5159878 parents should be notified but should not have veto power over a minor daughter
5159879 it makes no sense that a child should need to receive the permission of a parent to get an aspirin in school yet not be notified before their child has an abortion
5159880 i believe parents should definitely be notified before their child makes any life and death decision and i dont believe children should have unfettered access to abortion i believe in parental consent i also think it is necessary to start reducing the number of legal abortions by attacking those problems that push women to make such difficult decisions
5159881 i believe that parents have the right to know what medical procedures their minor children are considering i voted for parental notification for minors considering an abortion i voted to not allow a minor to be transported across state lines for an abortion and i voted to ban partial birth abortions
5159882 again i feel that the federal government does not have a place in peoples private lives
5159883 the practice of awarding federal funds to religious charities should be carefully regulated and directed towards funding programs that provide basic social services and do not try to discriminate
5159884 faith based organizations should be given the same opportunity to compete for federal contracts as any other group as commissioner of health and human services we gave the first contract to a faith based group and the results were outstanding we also developed a partnership to find areas where faith groups can work with government to get better outcomes for taxpayer dollars
5159885 the faith based initiatives bush has supported has in my opinion signaled an unwillingness of some conservatives to fund social programs directly by the federal government in choosing to give money to faith based groups those same conservatives wash their hands of the responsibilities tied to social spending and at the same time confuse the issue by co mingling church with state the problem is lack of political courage as a strong proponent of a national health program i assure the voters of new hampshire that if i believe something is right i dont need my church to absolve me of guilt while acting on it
5159886 use of government funding for faith based organizations to run for example soup kitchens food pantries emergency shelter natural disaster relief efforts or similar services is entirely appropriate
5159887 i believe that the federal government should stay out of peoples private lives as well as respect the laws and desires of each state in our country
5159888 for that reason i do not support the federal government legislating on the topic of marriage
5159889 due to my beliefs about marriage as a member of congress i voted for the constitutional amendment that protects marriage as a union of a woman and a man
5159890 i would much prefer state courts across the country would stop attempting to redefine the concept of marriage
5159891 to enter into contractual arrangements as anyone however the federal government should not be forced to recognize civil unions that are attempts at marriage by another name
5159892 since gays and lesbians are already marrying in religious ceremonies i cannot in good conscience deny their right to religious freedom
5159893 and by not allowing a civil recognition of those core beliefs is to deny them rights due not only to their sexual preferences but also due to those philosophical and religious beliefs
5159894 i support gays and lesbians right to define marriage in their own manner just as i support the right of my own catholic faith to define marriage in its own manner with no government imposed morals
5159895 it makes no sense that a child should need to receive the permission of a parent to get an aspirin in school yet not be notified before their child has an abortion
5159896 i voted for parental notification for minors considering an abortion i voted to not allow a minor to be transported across state lines for an abortion and i voted to ban partial birth abortions
5159897 i also think it is necessary to start reducing the number of legal abortions by attacking those problems that push women to make such difficult decisions
5159898 signaled an unwillingness of some conservatives to fund social programs directly by the federal government in choosing to give money to faith based groups those same conservatives wash their hands of the responsibilities tied to social spending and at the same time confuse the issue by co mingling church with state the problem is lack of political courage
5159899 if i believe something is right i dont need my church to absolve me of guilt while acting on it
5159900 as commissioner of health and human services we gave the first contract to a faith based group and the results were outstanding we also developed a partnership to find areas where faith groups can work with government to get better outcomes for taxpayer dollars
5159901 should be carefully regulated and directed towards funding programs that provide basic social services and do not try to discriminate
5159902 i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years

5159906 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
5159907 i thought i threw the ball well and moved around ok
5159908 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work
5159909 he moved the team down the field and put us in a position to score
5159910 does that sound a little awkward or funny maybe a little bit believe me i feel very comfortable here the guys have been great theyve welcomed me i feel like im here for a reason as ive told the guys im here for one reason to help you win ill do whatever that takes and i hope it works out
5159911 obviously a lot of things have gone on the last few months
5159912 im not going to sit here and say i havent second guessed decisions not only this year but along the way one thing i know for sure when i stepped on the field as i did tonight i knew i made the right decision
5159913 were a team and im just one piece of this puzzle
5159914 at some point we have to go on and focus on what were trying to do as a team and not on one person
5159915 why do you need to enrich uranium if you dont have the facilities that can make use of this uranium for civilian purp

5159917 i just knew that i had to try and survive to help them out
5159918 i tried to make the right decisions and luckily we got out
5159919 there were a couple of moments where i had to lead them up quite a dangerous avalanche slope and i told them to hang on and when i went up i set an avalanche off and i really feared for their lives but we just had to continue on and try
5159920 literally we were digging ourselves in a hole deeper and deeper and getting buried more and more
5159921 i just wanted to try and jot down some of my thoughts and what was happening because i didnt know if wed get out of it and i just wanted to write a record down when i was still sane because in such cold conditions your body starts deteriorating quite quickly

5159987 the report relies on biased and selective samples of roaming rates in selected countries and fails to give a realistic picture of rates in a range of countries it compares average consumer charges for roamed and non roamed calls and uses it to make headline statements about australian international roaming charges the report compares the average cost of calling an international destination with the average cost of calling from the destination back to australia this is like comparing apples with oranges
